They are stylish, versatile, and budget-friendly. As do-it-yourself projects go, they’re also rather simple to create and install. Your biggest challenge will be choosing just one DIY pipe shelf idea to stick to!', '## 17 Awesome DIY Pipe Shelves for Budget-friendly Organizing\r\n\r\n![DIY pipe shelves](/resources/images/best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-pinterest-share-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nJust in case you haven’t been engaging in the DIY home decor space recently, let us tell you about these design gems. DIY pipe shelves use metal pipes and fittings combined with (usually) wood to create shelving units. These units may sit on the floor or be mounted to the ceiling or wall. The design is industrial-inspired and looks absolutely perfect with minimalist decor, boho-chic design, and eclectic aesthetics, but it can also be worked into just about any design theme. That’s because there is so much versatility in the color and shape of metal and wood used.\r\n\r\nIf you’re going for a raw, edgy look, then check out the ideas with black pipe and raw or dark finished wood. If you want a softer, more sophisticated version, then look at the antiqued designs or those with more structural elements. For a more creative flair try copper pipes or fully painted wood shelves. You can really mix and match the possibilities until you come up witha look you absolutely love.\r\n\r\nLet’s talk wall mounting, folks. These designs make incredible wall-mounted and floating shelving units. You can also ceiling mount shelves for a unique spin on the theme. For pieces on the floor, you can use pipe fittings or swap them out for wheels to create a movable unit.\r\n\r\nThink about where you want your shelves to go, what you plan to put on them, and how you want them to look in the context of the rest of the room. This can make your DIY design process easier and ensure that you choose the perfect DIY pipe shelves for you!\r\n\r\n## 1. Simple and Stylish Pipe Wall Shelf\r\n\r\n![Simple and Stylish Pipe Wall Shelf](/resources/images/01-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis do-it-yourself wall unit is simple, sturdy, and looks amazing. If you want something that can handle heavier loads like these printers, then anchoring to the wall like this is a brilliant idea. You won’t have to worry about bumping into things. Woven baskets are a fabulous idea for organizing odds and ends in a pipe and wood shelving unit like this. Add a couple of purely decorative items to soften the look and make it homier. Another great thing about this type of design is that you can make it as wide or as tall as you need to. The possibilities are endless!\r\n\r\n## 2. Minimalist Floating Bar Shelves with Iron Pipe Brackets\r\n\r\n![Minimalist Floating Bar Shelves with Iron Pipe Brackets](/resources/images/02-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to have a bar in your home but short on space? This floating shelf idea is a stylish solution! In fact, this looks so amazing that you may want to opt for a floating DIY pipe shelf idea for a bar no matter how big or small your home is. A project like this couldn’t be easier. Forget a weekend – you can pull this off in an hour! All you need are the necessary pipes and brackets, a secure wall mount, and a piece of finished wood. Arrange your glasses and spirits on the shelf and you’ve got yourself a bar. Cheers!\r\n\r\n## 3. L-Bracket Pipe and Wood Wall Shelving\r\n\r\n![L-Bracket Pipe and Wood Wall Shelving](/resources/images/03-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not exactly a floating shelf, but it gives you the same effect while also showing off a little bit of raw, industrial style. Using a pipe configured into an L-bracket makes for a super-secure shelf. It’s hard to believe that something this pretty can be made with a couple of pipes and a two-by-four, but here’s your proof! You can play with the pipe color – either by choosing a different metal or painting it – to suit your decor. You can also mix this up by finishing the wood differently. A darker finish would look warm and masculine. A whitewash would look great with farmhouse decor.\r\n\r\n## 4. Hip Portable Pipe and Wood Shelving Unit\r\n\r\n![Hip Portable Pipe and Wood Shelving Unit](/resources/images/04-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh man, this movable shelving unit is inspiring major design envy! This is an awesome example of how (almost) raw wood and galvanized pipe furniture can perfectly complement the eclectic decor. This particular set of DIY pipe shelves is particularly brilliant because it’s on wheels! If you need to be able to move things around in your home (say for a guest staying over or in a multipurpose room) this makes it incredibly easy to do. Just roll the shelving unit wherever you want it! You can push it out of the way, use it as a room divider, or change it out with another piece of furniture in a snap.\r\n\r\n## 5. Warm and Welcoming Pewter and Wood Shelves\r\n\r\n![Warm and Welcoming Pewter and Wood Shelves](/resources/images/05-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about DIY pipe shelves is that you can customize them like none other. Simply cut the wood pieces down to the length and width to fit into your living space and get the pipes cut to match. Just look at this adorable solution for floating bathroom shelves. Bathrooms can be full of odd nooks, crannies, and empty walls that can look awkward when they’re bare. Add a couple of floating shelves and some cleverly disguised storage decor to liven up the space.\r\n\r\n## 6. Boho Industrial Iron and Wood Floating Shelves\r\n\r\n![Boho Industrial Iron and Wood Floating Shelves](/resources/images/06-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOften DIY pipe shelf design is categorized as “industrial” decor, but that doesn’t mean you have to live in an NYC loft to make it work. Just look at how gorgeous these soft and frilly ceramics look atop industrial wood and iron floating shelves! This particular style can lend a touch of modernity to farmhouse or shabby chic style, which can sometimes look a bit dated. Keeping things simple and sparse will only make this decor look more stylish. If you like to keep things minimal – or just can’t afford a bunch of stuff – then this decor theme will work especially well for you as minimalist simplicity is the name of the industrial game.\r\n\r\n## 7. Office-Ready Professional DIY Pipe Shelf Design\r\n\r\n![Office-Ready Professional DIY Pipe Shelf Design](/resources/images/07-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether your office is in your home or your place of work, this DIY pipe shelf idea will look professional and get the job done. Using a thinner pipe and rounding the corners of the wooden shelves adds some refinement to this rustic style. The dark finish on the wood also makes a great match for a professional environment. This is a much more attractive, fashionable, and unique design than your run of the mill particle board shelving unit. Since the shelves are exposed, organize your items with baskets, book ends, and magazine boxes.\r\n\r\n## 8. Complete DIY Wall Unit with Jointed Pipe and Wood Shelves\r\n\r\n![Complete DIY Wall Unit with Jointed Pipe and Wood Shelves](/resources/images/08-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA wood and pipe wall shelf can be functional and fashionable. Just take a look at this stunning design. A pre-fab shelving unit of this size would easily cost five or six times more than this do-it-yourself version. The simple, symmetrical design sets the perfect backdrop for a collection of your favorite things. This is absolutely perfect for rooms with big, empty walls that are begging for a statement piece. Place larger pieces on higher shelves and smaller pieces on lower shelves to perfectly balance the space. Hot tip: colored glass adds interesting color and texture while still appearing spacious and letting light through.\r\n\r\n## 9. Rustic Ceiling-Mounted Wood and Pipe Craft Shelves\r\n\r\n![Rustic Ceiling-Mounted Wood and Pipe Craft Shelves](/resources/images/09-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlip it and reverse it! Create DIY pipe shelves that come from the ceiling instead of the floor to expand your working and storage space. This is a genius solution for a craft room like this, for an office, a laundry room, a kitchen – any room where you have furniture on the floor, need storage and have wall space that is underutilized. Aside from the use of a ladder, this is about as simple as installing DIY pipe shelves from the floor. It looks amazing and gives you a very practical solution for storing your things.\r\n\r\n## 10. Gorgeous Floor-to-Ceiling Dimensional Pipe Shelving Display\r\n\r\n![Gorgeous Floor-to-Ceiling Dimensional Pipe Shelving Display](/resources/images/10-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet creative with your design with this elegant solution. One of the great things about a DIY pipe shelf idea is that you can mix and match width and height to just the way you want it. A wall unit like this is a perfect example. You can plan your shelves to accommodate works of art or other decorative items. Having various shelf heights also adds an artistic appearance that’s less utilitarian and more design-focused. This particular room is an awesome example of an eclectic, bohemian design blending perfectly with a warm industrial pipe shelving design.\r\n\r\n## 11. Sturdy, Affordable, and Chic Pipe Bookshelf\r\n\r\n![Sturdy, Affordable, and Chic Pipe Bookshelf](/resources/images/11-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIY pipe shelf design is incredibly sturdy. You can load those shelves up with super heavy items like a collection of books or records with no problem at all. This shelf is proof positive of the load-bearing capacity of this design choice. If you’ve ever dreamt of having a personal library, this is a great way to put it on display. Having a unit for these very heavy items is best to be placed on the floor. A properly mounted pipe wall shelf can also handle a lot, but a floor mount is your safest choice.\r\n\r\n## 12. DIY Copper Pipe Transformation Idea\r\n\r\n![DIY Copper Pipe Transformation Idea](/resources/images/12-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepending on the design of your home, you may want to opt for a different shade of metal in your DIY pipe shelves. You can pretty easily find pipes in black, silver or copper. The price differences in these materials can be significant, so to change colors on a budget you can simply spray paint the pipes instead. Just pick up a can of metallic spray paint in the color of your choice. Spray the pipes and allow them to dry before installing them. Because these are overall stationary objects, there’s not a huge risk of paint chipping or wear and tear.\r\n\r\n## 13. Simple Copper Pipe and White Wood Floating Shelves\r\n\r\n![Simple Copper Pipe and White Wood Floating Shelves](/resources/images/13-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing copper instead of black or galvanized steel pipes can completely change the look of your DIY pipe shelf design. The appearance is lighter and brighter. It goes beautifully with white shelves like these, or with wooden shelves. If you want an almost invisible look, then painting the shelves to match the wall they are mounted on will do the trick. The glossy finish also goes nicely with the brightness of the copper color. You can also tie in the soft, warm metallics with the items you display on the shelves, like the copper-hued vase and metallic frame.\r\n\r\n## 14. Warm Industrial Floor-to-Ceiling DIY Pipe Shelves\r\n\r\n![Warm Industrial Floor-to-Ceiling DIY Pipe Shelves](/resources/images/14-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can make your ceilings appear taller and create attractive display and storage space by taking your pipe wall shelf from floor to ceiling. The vertical lines create an optical illusion of height which can really open up your space. You can double down by varying the height of the shelves as well. Adding in a double-tall shelf adds more open space and contributes to the visual effect of more height. Add a collection of beautiful things, books, and mementos to create a truly gorgeous design. The chic, industrial look really lends itself to displaying eclectic decor.\r\n\r\n## 15. Indoor Garden on Shelves Made of Pipe and Wood\r\n\r\n![Indoor Garden on Shelves Made of Pipe and Wood](/resources/images/15-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArt, books, and dishes aren’t the only things that can go on your shelves. How about some plants instead? Just check out this brilliant DIY pipe shelf design for an indoor garden! The shelves hold the plants and the lights are mounted on the bottom of each shelf to shine on the surface below. This is such a cool way to grow things like herbs and microgreens indoors or even to house your outdoor plants in the winter months. You could even paint the light fixtures to coordinate with the shelving unit – or add a creative design.\r\n\r\n## 16. Bright, Warm Copper Pipe and Mahogany Shelves\r\n\r\n![Bright, Warm Copper Pipe and Mahogany Shelves](/resources/images/16-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt’s just incredible how much the color of metal pipes you choose for your DIY pipe shelves can change their appearance. Don’t believe us? Just take a look at this copper pipe shelving idea. The warm copper color almost blends in with the color of the wood. It’s a much softer look than black pipes, but just as functional. Using a wood finish with a reddish stain is a great idea to go with copper pipes. This just goes to show that the shade of wood or metal used in these designs can dramatically change the way the final result looks. It’s also helpful to know that if you’re unhappy with your design you can change it pretty easily with a can of paint!\r\n\r\n## 17.

Black pipe is reminiscent of cast iron and, when paired with weathered wood, has a look that’s old-fashioned in the best sense of the word. This style would look lovely in a more traditional home or with country-style decor. It is simple, elegant, and functional all at the same time. This piece works great in a home office space, but could just as easily hold items in the kitchen or serve as a bedside table.\r\n\r\n## 17 Amazing-looking DIY Pipe Shelves for Every Budget\r\n\r\nWhat an incredible collection of creative design ideas! It’s hard to believe that just two elements – pipe and wood – can create such a variety of styles and ideas. If you’re not sure where to start, any employee at your local hardware or home improvement store can walk you through the basics of putting together the pipes and fixtures to create the shape you want. They can also help you determine what types of screws or other hardware you’ll need to attach the pipes to the wood as well as the walls or ceiling if you’re doing a mounted version.

Often you can collaborate with the designers to get the exact right look you are searching for, thus customizing the project without doing all the work yourself.\r\n\r\nTake your time and be sure to double check all your measurements before getting started. Corner shelves can be tricky, but the finished product is so rewarding that it will be well worth your time and effort.\r\n\r\n## 1.

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (8, 9, '24 On-trend Pantry Shelving Ideas to Organize Your Kitchen', 'You may dread opening your pantry because it is so disorganized that it’s depressing, but you can quickly turn things around with the right pantry shelving ideas. When you need something that you know you put in your pantry, it may take several minutes to find it. Your pantry situation might even be worse than badly disorganized. You may dread opening it because you fear being buried under the mound of everything you have stuffed into it and never being heard from again.', '## 24 Pantry Shelving Ideas that will Make You more Productive in the Kitchen\r\n\r\n![Pantry Shelving Ideas](/resources/images/best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-pinterest-share-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nPantries get stuffed with all kinds of stuff like canned and packaged foods; snack foods; flavorings like spices, herbs, and cooking vinegars, oils, and wines; small appliances; cookbooks; mixing bowls; baking dishes; small items like cookie cutters and Belgian waffle irons; napkins, paper plates, and paper cups; and if the kitchen sink didn’t already have its own place in the kitchen, it might be stuffed in the pantry as well. Pantries aren’t meant to thwart us with the amount of unorganized stuff that we stuff in them, though. Pantries are actuallymeant to help us locate the things we store in them quickly and easily so that we can go on with preparing the food that we wanted to prepare or preparing the grocery list of things we need to buy.\r\n\r\nWhen you open your pantry, you should be able to reach in and grab what you need in a few seconds or see what you need to add to your grocery list in a minute or two. You shouldn’t have to move things to see what’s behind them or pick up things that fall to the floor when you reach for something else.\r\n\r\nYour pantry problems may only result from disorganization. In that case, using baskets or bins to corral small items, larger bins to hold bulky items, multi-tiered shelving to keep items in view, and a labeling system so that the whole family knows where everything belongs should help.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you may be trying too much stuff on the shelf space in your pantry. In that case, you may need to look for ways to increase your storage space to your pantry. You could create more storage space on the back of the door or on the walls around your pantry. You could also create more storage space in a closet, mudroom, somewhere else in your kitchen or your home and move some of the things that you have in your pantry to the new space.\r\n\r\n## 1. Product and Inventory Control Pantry Organization Idea\r\n\r\n![Product and Inventory Control Pantry Organization Idea](/resources/images/01e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:seevanessacraft.com\r\n\r\nIf you’re like most of us, your system for organizing your pantry probably consists of having certain shelves designated for certain types of products, and those products probably are arranged by size. With just a little more organizing, you can save time when you are cooking or creating a grocery list, and you can provide better inventory control. This pantry organizing idea provides more storage space with adjustable shelves on the door, captures small objects in pull out bins, and uses see-through canisters for products that come in bags, like flour and sugar. The canisters eliminate spills from torn bags, and let you see with a quick glance what is low.\r\n\r\n## 2. Additional Pantry Space Shelving Solution\r\n\r\n![Additional Pantry Space Shelving Solution](/resources/images/02e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpeg)\r\n\r\nSource:elevengables.com\r\n\r\nWhether you don’t have an existing pantry or need more pantry space, kitchen pantry ideas can be created using other shelving such as bookcases. These two shelving units could be built-in, preassembled bookcases, and doors could be added. See-through jars and baskets also help organize this pantry space. An additional pantry storage idea shown here is the plastic bins for cans. The bins are wire mesh that are lower in the front so that you can easily see and remove the items they contain. The cans are stacked on their sides so that they don’t tumble.\r\n\r\n## 3. Pantry Shelving Ideas for the Dining Room\r\n\r\n![Pantry Shelving Ideas for the Dining Room](/resources/images/03e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:asavoryfeast.com\r\n\r\nWith the half-glass doors added to this Billy Bookcase from Ikea, you can actually place your pantry storage unit in the dining room. You might even have room to place two of them side by side. This pantry organization idea will not only help you store pantry items, but it can also act as a credenza and give you a place to store dishes that will display nicely behind the doors. The shelves on this bookcase are adjustable, making it easier to store tall items. Add baskets, bins, and clear jars, and you have created a new location for a pantry storage idea.\r\n\r\n## 4. Using Organizational Items to Maximize Storage Space\r\n\r\n![Using Organizational Items to Maximize Storage Space](/resources/images/04e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:cassandrajed-cassadiva.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nInstead of glass canisters, this pantry storage ideas uses stackable plastic storage containers to reduce wasted space. Place larger containers on the top shelf and pull them forward so that they can be be easily accessed. Use the space behind these containers to store items that aren’t used often. Smaller containers on the next shelf are pushed back because there are so many that you don’t want to move them to get to other items. On the next shelf, a three-tiered rack with a space underneath for foil, plastic wrap, and storage bags makes great use of vertical space. Pull-out bins keep items contained but provide easy access. Finally, hang small plastic-coated wire baskets in whatever sizes you need canned foods, spices, and other items.\r\n\r\n## 5. Labeling Can be Key to Maintaining Organization\r\n\r\n![Labeling Can be Key to Maintaining Organization](/resources/images/05e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:stacygravesinteriors.com\r\n\r\nThis pantry organization idea uses clear plastic bins with handles. The bins have squared edges, so they sit side by side without wasted space. Just make sure you leave enough space between them so that you can remove them easily. The handles help you maintain control of the bin. A multi-tiered shelving unit keeps canned foods accessible. Hanging under-shelf baskets creates vertical storage for linens. However, the best idea here may be labeling the bins so that family members know in what bins items belong when they are done with them. This helps maintain your organized pantry design.\r\n\r\n## 6. Create a Pantry Design for a Closet\r\n\r\n![Create a Pantry Design for a Closet](/resources/images/06e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:thevintagewren.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have a pantry in your home, you can use the pantry shelving ideas generated by this image and create a pantry in a closet, laundry room, mudroom, basement, or garage. The only caution in using some areas is concerns about temperature and humidity control. These concerns depend on the type of food you want to store. Even canned goods should be stored at 70° F or less. If you are going to use a closet, measure its width, and purchase brackets and mesh, wood, or board shelves that will fit across the closet. You can also select mesh or metal ready-to-assemble shelving units that fit your space.\r\n\r\n## 7. Looking for Less Intensive Pantry Organization Ideas\r\n\r\n![Looking for Less Intensive Pantry Organization Ideas](/resources/images/07e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:crazy-wonderful.com\r\n\r\nIf you just need to do a little straightening in your pantry rather than a full scale reorganization with a lot of special containers, try the ideas from this pantry. Baskets hold bulky items, and labeling helps you and your family know where things are. Wire shelving helps create a second tier of shelving over shorter items. Moving spices to baskets on the empty space on the back of the door makes use of that vertical space, and clears up cluttered shelf space making it available for other items. These quick, less expensive kitchen pantry idea will still result in a better organized pantry.\r\n\r\n## 8. Kitchen Pantry Ideas for Creating Larger Pantries\r\n\r\n![Kitchen Pantry Ideas for Creating Larger Pantries](/resources/images/08e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:willscasa.com\r\n\r\nA large walk-in pantry allows you to store groceries and appliances in the pantry, which is not generally possible in most homes. If you would like a larger pantry, you might consider converting a mudroom off of the kitchen, enclosing a space in the kitchen, or using the space under the second floor stairway like this pantry does. In most homes, the space under the stairs is a small, cramped, first-floor half-bath for guests. Using that space would require moving the guest bath to a potentially roomier space on the first floor. If you really want a larger pantry, look around your home and consider your options.\r\n\r\n## 9. Consider Custom Pantry Shelving Ideas\r\n\r\n![Consider Custom Pantry Shelving Ideas](/resources/images/09e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:homeonpoplarcreek.com\r\n\r\nFor a pantry that really works for you, you could design and build a customized pantry or have one built. This would allow you to have the pantry divided into sections intended for specific items. This image shows a shelf that holds the mixer nicely. It also has a space for storing cookie sheets and two pullout baskets. Think about the items that you use a lot, the items that are hard to fit in your cupboards, and the items that are sitting on your counters, and decide if a customized pantry might improve the efficiency of your kitchen.\r\n\r\n## 10. Clever Ways to Add More Storage Space\r\n\r\n![Clever Ways to Add More Storage Space](/resources/images/10e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:eclecticrecipes.com\r\n\r\nThis walk-in pantry with shelves on both sides would be nice to have, but there are some space-increasing ideas in this pantry and in other images when you click on the source link. First, adding pegboard to any wall space in your pantry or on the back of the door allows you to hang utensils, molds, pans, or baskets. On the source page, you will see a pantry where the shelving only goes part way so that a pull-out shelf could be installed increasing storage space. Another pantry storage idea is converting a cupboard into an expanded spice cupboard. Short shelves holding spices are in the back, and then a swing-out spice shelf unit is in the front.\r\n\r\n## 11. Another Coat Closet Conversion Using Crates\r\n\r\n![Another Coat Closet Conversion Using Crates](/resources/images/11e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:momhomeguide.com\r\n\r\nThis is another coat closet converted into a pantry. With a mudroom and other storage available throughout the house, it was possible to move the items in the coat closet. This conversion was then done in a less expensive and more temporary way so that it can easily be converted back into a coat closet or to another use if desired. Rather than buying and installing shelves or purchasing bookcases, crates were assembled to create the needed shelving. You can also use wall space and some of the previous organizational ideas to make the most of this converted closet pantry.\r\n\r\n## 12. Converting a Deep Pantry to Wrap-around Shelves\r\n\r\n![Converting a Deep Pantry to Wrap-around Shelves](/resources/images/12e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:vickiliston.com\r\n\r\nWhile providing ample storage, a pantry with deep shelves poses issues with access and inventory of the products in the back. These issues can be resolved without losing too much storage space by creating wrap-around shelves. Reducing the depth of the current shelves by one half allows you to add shelves on both sides so that you can step in and get a better view and access to the items on the shelves. It also allows more light to reach items in the back of the shelves so that they aren’t hidden.\r\n\r\n## 13. A Reorganization that Recaps Kitchen Pantry Ideas\r\n\r\n![A Reorganization that Recaps Kitchen Pantry Ideas](/resources/images/13e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:livingletterhome.com\r\n\r\nThis pantry provides an opportunity to recap many of the ideas used in the pantries above. A major change in this pantry was that the mesh shelves were replaced by wood shelves. This seriously creates a different attitude toward keeping the pantry organized. The storage containers include clear jars that make taking inventory easier. Baskets help organize products and reduce clutter. Rather than buying three-tiered shelves, you could make your own wood risers, and a Lazy Susan helps access items. The rolling crates under the bottom shelf have pulls that make them great for accessing heavier items.\r\n\r\n## 14. Using Cupboard Space for Storing Pantry Items\r\n\r\n![Using Cupboard Space for Storing Pantry Items](/resources/images/14e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:crayonsandcravings.com\r\n\r\nSometimes you don’t have a choice, you have to use cupboard space for pantry items, and that is when being organized is really important. Using one type of clear containers that are designed to stack together makes the best use of space, helps with inventory, and keeps your food fresher than store packaging. Baskets help to corral similar items, provide a unified look, and can be pulled out to easily access their contents. The final step is to label the container with the name of its contents. A smaller additional label can be used on all products to keep track of the expiration date.\r\n\r\n## 15. Open Pantry Design Fit for a Chef\r\n\r\n![Open Pantry Design Fit for a Chef](/resources/images/15e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:gingerandthehuth.com\r\n\r\nPantry shelving ideas aren’t usually showpieces, but this one is, and it shows how an organized pantry can make a kitchen more efficient. Just look at this and imagine gathering what you need to prepare a meal. The first step is considering what you want included in your pantry, such as the Kegorator and the coffee bar. Then you have to decide if you are hiring a builder or building it yourself. Measuring, drawing your plans, and calculating materials and costs should be done carefully so that building your pantry goes smoothly. Of course, you could add doors, but who wants to do that when the pantry is this gorgeous.\r\n\r\n## 16. Grouping Products in Your Pantry\r\n\r\n![Grouping Products in Your Pantry](/resources/images/16e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:thegoldprojectblog.com\r\n\r\nPlanning on how you will group products in your pantry should actually be the first step in your pantry design project. Baking products, spices, and paper products are obvious, but for easier mornings, consider keeping breakfast products together. Studying what you keep in your pantry, how the products relate to each other, and how and when you use them will help you decide what containers you need, what sizes you need, and how many of each container you need. Then, you’re ready to shop for containers while keeping the cost down. Your pantry organization ideas don’t have to cost a lot. The final key to success is to label containers so that your family knows what goes where.\r\n\r\n## 17. Farmhouse-style, Custom-made, Tiny Home Free-standing Pantry\r\n\r\n![Farmhouse-style, Custom-made, Tiny Home Free-standing Pantry](/resources/images/17e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:homestead-honey.com\r\n\r\nPantry shelving ideas can have style and not be expensive. In addition, they can hold a lot of items and still be compact. This pantry shelving unit looks like a bookcase, but it was built to hold inexpensive quart canning jars and gallon jars. To conserve space, the eight shelves are just 1/2 inch taller than the jars they are meant to hold. If the space available in your home is not that wide, then the pantry shelving unit could be made taller but not as wide. The wood used to make the pantry was beautifully hand finished.\r\n\r\n## 18. Custom Cabinets for a Transformed Closet Pantry\r\n\r\n![Custom Cabinets for a Transformed Closet Pantry](/resources/images/18e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:diydesignfanatic.com\r\n\r\nStudying a closet that you are going to convert to a pantry could give you some custom pantry shelving ideas. The closet that was going to be converted was wide enough to actually create a double shelf unit. So, instead of making the cupboards stationary and built-in, the bottom cupboard on one side became a rolling cart so that it and its contents could be rolled out and used in the kitchen. The bottom half on the other side includes a coffee station and a convenient outlet was installed. This turned an under-utilized closet into a very functional extension of the kitchen.\r\n\r\n## 19. Odd Space to Country Pantry Storage Idea\r\n\r\n![Odd Space to Country Pantry Storage Idea](/resources/images/19c-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:welivedhappilyeverafter.com\r\n\r\nSometimes older homes may have odd open nooks offering space that can be put to a number of uses. If you have such a space near your kitchen, you could add a wall, install shelves, and design your own pantry. You can have floor to ceiling shelves. You could install a counter and outlets for some of your appliances. You can enclose the space behind a door or leave it open to create a focal point. You could build in a desk and bookcase shelves where you can look through your cookbooks, look at recipes online, plan your menus, and write out your grocery list. Dream up the pantry with the features that will work best for you, and then create it.\r\n\r\n## 20. Remodeled Pantry Shelving Ideas\r\n\r\n![Remodeled Pantry Shelving Ideas](/resources/images/20e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:manhattan-nest.com\r\n\r\nIf you have an older home that has been remodeled multiple times, you might find some odd spaces that you could convert into a pantry. In this case, a staircase had been relocated as part of one past remodeling project. Two closets were built where the staircase had been. To create this pantry, the wall between the closets was demolished, creating the long, narrow space for the pantry. The narrow shelves along the length of the space keep smaller items visible and accessible while the wider shelving at the end provides room for larger items like the microwave, cereal boxes, cookbooks, and other larger items. The drawer under the counter for the microwave keeps cleaning supplies out of sight.\r\n\r\n## 21. Cute and Organized Kitchen Pantry Ideas\r\n\r\n![Cute and Organized Kitchen Pantry Ideas](/resources/images/21e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:whitelanedecor.com\r\n\r\nJust because a pantry is a utilitarian room doesn’t mean it has to be dull. You could use wall decals with any motif that suits you from pantry and kitchen related designs like fruit, vegetables, pasta, or coffee mugs to fanciful flowers, butterflies, and rainbows to a large, stick-on wall mural that might feature a café, an urban street scene, a garden, or a country meadow. If you don’t have a fixture for a ceiling light, you can have an electrician install the wiring. Then you can add a pendant light that enhances your pantry’s theme. Attach battery operated LED lights to the bottom of some shelves for more illumination.\r\n\r\n## 22. Large Modern French Pantry Shelving Ideas\r\n\r\nThis larger pantry carries the décor used throughout the home into the storage area. The pantry contains counter space that could be used for food preparation or to store appliances. Outlets allow you to use small appliances in the pantry. Below the counter, large cubby holes, some with L-shaped shelves that go around a corner offer storage space for large items. Other cubby holes have adjustable shelves. Above the counter, the shelves go up to the ceiling, so you have places to store frequently used items as well as less used items. A ceiling light illuminates the space.\r\n\r\n## 23. Rustic Small Closet Pantry Design Idea\r\n\r\n![Rustic Small Closet Pantry Design Idea](/resources/images/23e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:birgitkerr.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nYou can have a pantry even if all you have is a 2 1/2 x 3 1/2 foot coat closet. One set of shelves go across the back for tall items. Adjustable shelves on the right in front of the other shelves make use of that vertical space. Hanging shelves on the door turn more vertical space into storage area. Tall see-through containers with a small foot print hold items that come in bulky bags. Pull out drawers hold small packaged items like mixes and seasonings. Labeled wood crates hold items that you might want to pull out to use together. Finally, a Lazy Susan on each shelf keeps canned goods and other items accessible. A tiered Lazy Susan could make greater use of vertical space.\r\n\r\n## 24. Tuxedo-Look Kitchen Pantry Ideas\r\n\r\n![Tuxedo-Look Kitchen Pantry Ideas](/resources/images/24e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:momendeavors.com\r\n\r\nThis pantry storage idea carries the tuxedo look of the kitchen décor into the pantry. Chalkboard paint on the exterior of the pantry door turns it into a family message board. The alternating black and white storage baskets feature chalkboard labels that allow you to find and lift out all the things you need in each category at one time For example, one basket contains all of the snacks for a family snack fest and another all of the things for packing school lunches. Placing canned foods on a plastic coated wire shelf leaves storage space for small items underneath while, again, a multi-tiered rack keeps other canned goods easily accessible.\r\n\r\n## 24 Fresh Pantry Shelving Ideas to Organize Your Cooking Thyme\r\n\r\nAmong these pantries are ideas for keeping your pantry inventory easily accessible when you want to use it as well as highly visible when you want to know what supplies are low for your grocery list.

Though the aforementioned products are helpful, they often don’t have the same type of elegance that someone with a preference for lighter colors could actually use. This is why we appreciate that this Victor white desk organizer uses a white coat of paint that will pair much better with vibrant colors. The drawers also have a transparent layer of glass in-between them, something that gives off an elegant touch!\r\n\r\n## 27.

It’s pointless to install clever shelves and hooks if they’ll be ignored by your family.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like a lot to think about, don’t worry. We’ve already done the work for you when it comes to finding and curating small bathroom storage ideas.

Since burpees involve explosive plyometric movement, they\'ll get your heart pumping too.\n\n**How to do burpees: **Stand with your feet shoulder-distance apart and send your hips back as you lower your body toward the ground in a low squat. Then, place your hands right outside of your feet and hop your feet back, allowing your chest to touch the floor. Push your hands against the floor to lift your body up into a plank and then jump your feet just outside of your hands.

While it is slightly complicated, she says that the total-body conditioning move is seriously effective for blasting belly fat.\n\n**How to do a Turkish get-up: **Holding one kettlebell by the handle with both hands, lie on your side in a fetal position. Roll onto your back and press the kettlebell up toward the ceiling with both hands until the weight is stable on one loaded side. Release your free arm and free leg to a 45-degree angle with your palm facing down. Slide the heel of the loaded side closer to your butt to firmly grip the floor.\n\nPushing through the foot on the floor, punch the kettlebell up with the loaded arm and roll onto your free forearm. Don\'t shrug your shoulder toward your ear with the supporting side. Be sure to keep your chest wide open. Straighten the elbow on the ground and lift yourself up to a seated position. Weave your front leg through to the back. To protect your knees, your shin on the back leg should be perpendicular to your shin on the front leg.\n\nPerfectly align your arms: wrist over elbow, shoulder over elbow over wrist. Raise your torso to make your upper body erect. Swivel your back knee so that your back shin is parallel with your front shin. Get a grip on the floor with your back toes, then take a deep breath, and stand up.\n\n4Medicine Ball Burpees\n\n![Focussed on her workout](/resources/images/focussed-on-her-workout-royalty-free-image-508126435-1543356195.jpg)\n\nPIXDELUXEGETTY IMAGES\n\nPhelps suggests adding amedicine ball to your burpee to increase the intensity of the exercise and boost yourmetabolism—all while building a sleek set of six-pack abs.\n\n**How to do medicine ball burpees: **Standing with your feet shoulder-distance apart, hold a medicine ball with both hands. Extend the ball up overhead, then slam the ball down on the ground as hard as you can, hinging over and sitting your butt back as you slam. As you hinge over, bend your knees. Place your hands on the ground outside of your feet and jump back into a high-plank position. Keep your body in a straight line. Then, jump your feet back towards the outsides of your hands so that you are squatting. Pick up the ball and press it overhead, extending your body and standing tall.\n\n5Sprawls\n\n![A beautiful muscular girl in tights and a vest makes a warm-up at the stadium. gym, fitness, healthy lifestyle](/resources/images/beautiful-muscular-girl-in-tights-and-a-vest-makes-royalty-free-image-1568757238.jpg)\n\nVADIARGETTY IMAGES\n\nThe sprawl is basically a burpee on steroids—a full body exercise that works as many muscles as possible and burns calories while shaping and toning upper- and lower-body, especially your abs. “It takes the traditional burpee to the next level by having you touch your chest to the ground, then push-up to plank as you continue the move,” explains Braganza.****\n\n**How to do a sprawl: **Standing with your feet shoulder-distance apart, squat down and place your hands on the ground. Jump your feet back to a plank and lower your body to touch the ground. Push yourself up to a plank and then jump your feet outside of your hands into a squat. Stand back up. That’s one rep. “If you want to burn even more calories, add a jump between each sprawl,” Braganza adds.\n\n6Side-to-Side Medicine Ball Slams\n\n![Confident young woman exercising with medicine ball](/resources/images/confident-young-woman-exercising-with-medicine-ball-royalty-free-image-867945298-1543356724.jpg)\n\nSOUTH_AGENCYGETTY IMAGES\n\n“Medicine ball slams are a dynamic, explosive, and highly metabolic exercise that does not simply target one muscle group,” explains Chris DiVecchio, trainer and founder ofPremier Body & Mind. On the surface, the obliques, hamstrings, quads, biceps, and shoulders are the primary movers of this exercise. “But as time goes on and fatigue sets in, nearly every other muscle in the body, in one way or another, may become involved as a secondary mover which makes this a total gut blaster,” he adds. Doing side-to-side ball slams versus overhead slams incorporates more oblique ab work.\n\n**How to do lateral medicine ball slams: **Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart with the medicine ball on one side. Pick up the ball and simply rotate your body as you slam the ball a few inches away from your pinky toe. Make sure to pivot your feet and bend the back knee as you come into a split squat position to catch the ball on one bounce. Alternate sides. Make sure you tighten your core as you bring the ball overhead and to the side.\n\n7Overhead Medicine Ball Slams\n\n![Young attractive woman exercising with medicine ball](/resources/images/young-attractive-woman-exercising-with-medicine-royalty-free-image-1568752737.jpg)\n\nOLEKSANDR BRIAGINGETTY IMAGES\n\nOverhead medicine ball slams strengthen your core as it works against gravity. This exercise also tests your endurance, getting your heart rate up each time you pick the ball up and bring it overhead. To get the most out of this exercise, be sure to use a heavy weighted ball.\n\n**How to do overhead medicine ball slams: **Standing tall with your feet hip-width apart, hold a medicine ball with both hands. Reach both arms overhead, fully extending your body. Slam the ball forward and down toward the ground. Extend your arms toward the ground as you slam and don’t be afraid to bend your knees as you hinge over. Squat to pick the ball up and then stand back up.\n\n8Russian Twists\n\n![Determined woman exercising with medicine ball on gym floor](/resources/images/determined-woman-exercising-with-medicine-ball-on-royalty-free-image-1568753444.jpg)\n\nNEUSTOCKIMAGESGETTY IMAGES\n\nThe Russian twist is a core exercise that improves oblique strength and definition, explains DiVecchio. The move, typically performed with a medicine ball or plate, involves rotating your torso from side to side while holding a sit-up position with your feet off the ground.\n\n**How to do Russian twists: ******Sit up tall on the floor with your knees bent and feet off the ground. Hold a medicine ball with your hands at chest height. Lean backward with a long, tall spine, holding your torso at a 45-degree angle and keeping your arms a few inches away from your chest. From here, turn your torso to the right, pause and squeeze your right oblique muscles, then turn your torso to the left and pause to squeeze your left oblique muscles. The movement should come from your ribs and not your arms.\n\n9BOSU Ball Planks\n\n![Fit brunette using bosu ball in plank position](/resources/images/fit-brunette-using-bosu-ball-in-plank-position-royalty-free-image-1568754089.jpg)\n\nWAVEBREAKMEDIAGETTY IMAGES\n\nYou know that your cardio sessions are crucial when it comes to burning the layer of fat sitting on top of your abdominal muscles. But it\'s still important to work those abs even as you\'re trying to shed fat, says New York City-based personal trainer Adam Sanford, founder ofAdam Sanford Fitness. His favorite move to do that? Holding plank on aBOSU ball.\n\nIt\'s more challenging than a normal plank where your hands are on the floor, because the BOSU tests your balance, says Sanford. \"When your body tries to find control as your balance is challenged, your abs, obliques, and deep transverse abdominal muscles are activated,\" he says. Strengthening these core muscles also helps increase yourmetabolism, ultimately helping you to burn more calories and fat.\n\n**How to do BOSU ball planks: **Flip a BOSU ball on its rubber side and hold onto the edges of the flat surface with both hands, about shoulder-distance apart. Hold the plank for 30 to 45 seconds, increasing the time as you get stronger.****\n\n10Running On an Incline\n\n![Low Section Of Woman Running On Treadmill In Gym](/resources/images/low-section-of-woman-running-on-treadmill-in-gym-royalty-free-image-1568753803.jpg)\n\nSUMETEE THEESUNGNERN / EYEEMGETTY IMAGES\n\nRunning at an incline rather than on a flat surface has been shown to increase total calorie burn by as much as 50 percent, saysJill Penfold, a Los Angeles-based personal trainer. Whether you\'re outside on a hill or at the gym on an inclined treadmill, start outwalking for five to 10 minutes, suggests Penfold. \"Your heart rate should elevate pretty quickly as you pick up your pace,\" she says.\n\n**Try this treadmill workout: **Walk or jog on an incline for five to 10 minutes. ****Maintain a jog for another five to 10 minutes, then pick your pace up again and start running. \"This doesn\'t have to be an all-out sprint,\" says Penfold, but you should be working hard enough that you can\'t carry a conversation. Spend five minutes running, then drop your pace back down to a jog. Continue alternating with five to 10 minutes of jogging and five to 10 minutes of running for 30 to 45 minutes.\n\n11Rowing Machine\n\n![Woman using rowing machine at gym](/resources/images/woman-using-rowing-machine-at-gym-royalty-free-image-1568754439.jpg)\n\nCAIAIMAGE/PAUL BRADBURYGETTY IMAGES\n\nJust because you may not have access to open water, it doesn\'t mean you can\'t weave this fat-blasting cardio workout into your gym routine. Not only does using arowing machine get your heart rate way up, which helps you blast calories and burn fat, but it also works muscles in your legs, core, arms, shoulders, andback, says Penfold.\n\n**Try this 4-minute rowing circuit:** Begin with 20 seconds of rowing followed by 10 seconds of rest. Look at how many meters you traveled in that time. (Don\'t get off the rowing machine or even let go of the handle when you rest, says Penfold.) Repeat this eight times, trying to beat your distance each time. When you\'re finished with this four-minute circuit, row a fast 500 meters and note how long it takes you. \"That\'s the number you\'ll want to match or beat during your next rowing session,\" says Penfold.\n\n12HIIT\n\n![Woman practicing jump squats in park](/resources/images/woman-practicing-jump-squats-in-park-royalty-free-image-1568754936.jpg)\n\nCAVAN IMAGESGETTY IMAGES\n\nWhile the old thinking was thatsteady-state cardio sessions were best for burning fat, we now know that short and intense bursts of fast-paced cardio is much more effective. Hope Pedraza, an ACSM personal trainer and the creator ofinBalance, a San Antonio-based fitness and wellness studio, suggests doing intervals that alternate between exercises that work different muscle groups.\n\n**Try this HIIT workout:** After a 10-minute warm-up, spend 30 seconds doing as many reps as possible ofsquats,push-ups, kettlebell swings, or single-arm rows. Then, rest for 30 seconds and do a different exercise for another 30 seconds. Continue for 10 rounds. Choose any of your favorite exercises—just make sure you alternate between exercises that work different muscle groups, which will help certain muscles recover while you work others.\n\n13Strength Training\n\n![Fitness girl lifting dumbbell in the morning.](/resources/images/fitness-girl-lifting-dumbbell-in-the-morning-royalty-free-image-1568755537.jpg)\n\nBOJAN89GETTY IMAGES\n\nIf you\'ve beenlifting moderately heavy weights but are still looking to drop belly fat, it\'s time to pick up the intensity by using heavier weights and cutting down on rest time between reps, saysTyler Spraul, CSCS, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and the head trainer atExercise.com. \"Lifting heavy is where you see more an afterburn effect. Your body continues to burn calories even after you leave the gym,\" Spraul says. Just be sure that your technique doesn\'t suffer as you increase your weight, which can lead to injury.

Simplywalking can go a long way toward helping you shed belly fat, saysSahmura Gonzalez, a personal trainer based in New York City.\n\n\"It seems so simple, but 45 to 60 minutes of brisk walking every day can do wonders for your metabolism,\" says Gonzalez. \"Plus, it ensures that you don\'t over-train, which can lead to an over-production of cortisol—a stress hormone that\'s been shown to contribute to belly fat.\"\n\nIf yourwalking workout helps you unwind after a stressful day or work through emotions that might otherwise stress you out, there\'s a chance it\'ll help you lower cortisol levels, which in turn can keep belly fat in check, says Gonzalez. And brisk walking is an effective way to drop pounds—including the belly fat that\'s hiding your abdominal muscles. \"One hour of rapid walking a day can lead to one pound of fat loss a week,\" says Gonzalez.\n\n15Yoga\n\n![Yoga classes](/resources/images/yoga-classes-royalty-free-image-1568756287.jpg)\n\nYULKAPOPKOVAGETTY IMAGES\n\nGetting your Om on won’t burn as many calories as a hilly run or lifting weights, but it can help build muscle and improve your endurance, which are all crucial for boosting your metabolism.

How to Do a Proper Plank, According to a Personal Trainer', 'This total-body exercise strengthens more than just your core.', 'Whether you’re taking a group fitness class or following anexercise DVD at home, it’s a sure bet that you’ll be doing planks at some point during the workout—and for good reason. Planks are the ultimate test of total-body strength, not just your core. That’s why they’re the groundwork for manybodyweight exercises, likepush-ups and burpees.\n\n“The plank is one of those jack-of-all-trades exercises you can carry in your back pocket to strengthen not only your core, but also your chest,arms, back,legs, andbooty,” explains,Nicole Blades, as NASM-certified trainer at BodyRoc FitLab in Connecticut. “A plank with proper form can help improveyour posture, too. The best part is, this dynamic move doesn’t require any equipment. It’s a total bodyweight exercise.”\n\n## So what muscles do planks work, exactly?\n\nWhether you’re in a low or high plank, you’re balancing weight on your arms and toes. This targets a wide range of muscles, especially the rectus and transverse abdominis, Blades says. Therectus abdominis are the front muscles in the abdomen that support the muscles of the spine and help keep organs in the abdomen area in place. They’re known as the “six-pack muscles” because they give your abs shape and definition.\n\n## MORE FROM PREVENTION\n\nCold and Flu Remedies\n\nOn the other hand, the transverse abdominis (TVA) muscles are known as the “corseting muscles” because they cinch the waist and act as core stabilizers that support the low back. In fact, a weak TVA is often the culprit oflower back pain.\n\nTHE BEST PLANK EXERCISES\n\n![Leg, Arm, Physical fitness, Shoulder, Joint, Exercise, Knee, Stretching, Hip, Human body, ](/resources/images/plankjack-1547064653.jpg) \n\nHow to Do Plank Jacks to Tone Your Entire Body\n![woman doing ab exercise](/resources/images/screen-shot-2021-01-03-at-7-03-36-pm-1609725784.png)Lower-Ab Exercises to Set Your Core on Fire\n\n“Planks also target the trapezius and rhomboid muscles (upper back muscles) in your back, as well as the pectorals (chest) and serratus anterior (the serrated-shaped muscles that wrap around the side of your chest and shoulder),” Blades says.\n\nWhen you engage yourupper body muscles, you’re putting less pressure on your core and are able to hold a plank longer. You can further engage your shoulders andback muscles in a plank when you grip the floor more with your fingers and hands. Keeping a neutral spine will also help relieve pressure on your neck and make holding a plank less uncomfortable.\n\n### But core includes your hips and low back, too.\n\nWhen people think of their core, they tend to think only about their abs—but the powerhouse includes your hips and low back, too. “A solid plank works the quads (front of the thighs), glutes, and calf muscles in your lower half,” Blades says.\n\nIn fact, your hips play a big role in making your planks stronger. Your hips are connected to yourlower abs (aka the lower part of your rectus abdominis), so engaging these muscles will help you hold the position longer with proper form. When you squeeze your hips, you’re also able to brace your core more and keep your low back lifted—something that many fitness newbies tend to overlook.\n\n## How to do a proper plank\n\nThere are many different ways to achieve the perfect plank, but here’s a step-by-step breakdown on how to do a high plank.\n\n1. Get into a tabletop position with your shoulders directly over your wrists and hips in line with your knees.\n2. Engaging your abs, shoulders, back, and glutes, extend your legs back to straighten into a plank and hold.\n3. If you can, do the exercise in front of a mirror, to check that your butt isn’t raised. (A common mistake, but your body should be flat as opposed to an upside down-V shape.)\n\nFor a modified plank, Blades suggests dropping to your knees instead of holding yourself up on your toes. “Get on all fours and walk your hands forward so your body forms a slanted line from your head to knees, like you would in a modified push-up,” she says. To recruit the glutes and hamstrings, keep your feet lifted toward your butt. Once you master this variation, you can work your way up to a forearm plank by placing your forearms on the ground.\n\n## How long should you hold a plank?\n\nAim to hold a plank for 15 seconds, then work your way up to 30, 45, 60 seconds, and so on. Instead of watching the clock, Blades suggests setting a timer. This way you’re not painstakingly watching the seconds go by. Don’t forget to also use your breath, deeply inhaling and exhaling.\n\nBy focusing on your breath, you’ll be able to help set your mind at ease throughout the uncomfortableness\n\nThe best way to hold a plank longer? “Practice, practice, practice,” Blades says. “The more you do the exercise, the more strength and endurance you will build and the longer you will be able to hold it. If you feel like you’re about to quit, push yourself to stay in plank a few seconds more. You can do it!”', 0, '2021-03-09 19:52:29', '2021-03-10 12:03:03', '/resources/images/push-up-variations-1561686713.png', 'https://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/a28747774/muscles-planking-exercise/', 1, 0);

Other studies that have measured fitness have found that being fit has significant health benefits regardless of weight.*\n\n\n------\n\n“‘Fat but fit’ is a myth.” “Overweight and healthy is a big fat lie.”\n\nThose and other headlines rang out recently as mainstream news outlets picked up the latest study on BMI, physical activity, and risk of cardiovascular disease. The researchers’ goal in this study, which was published in the *European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, *was to examine the notion of whether one can be “fat but fit,” a debate that has raged in the medical community for more than 20 years. And the study concluded that a physically active lifestyle cannot protect your heart against the negative impact of being overweight.\n\nThis particular study pulled data from 527,662 adults from Spain, with an average age of 42, who were insured by an occupational risk prevention company. They were put into groups according to their weight, based on BMI, and their activity levels. About 42 percent of the participants were normal weight with a BMI of 20 to 24.9; 41 percent were overweight with a BMI of 25 to 29.9; and 18 percent were classified as obese with a BMI of 30 or above.\n\nActivity levels were based on the World Health Organization (WHO) physical activity guidelines, which recommend performing at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous activity (or some combination of the two) a week.\n\nPeople who said they didn’t exercise at all were considered inactive. Those who reported some activity, but didn’t meet the minimum WHO requirements, were considered insufficiently active. Those who met the WHO minimum levels were considered regularly active. Overall, 63.5 percent were inactive; 12.3 percent were insufficiently active, and 24.2 percent were regularly active.\n\nThen the researchers examined the participants’ cardiovascular risk factors by categorizing them for high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes, all of which raise the risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\nAfter crunching the data, the researchers found that being active was definitely healthier than not being active. Those who reported some physical activity were less likely to have any of the three risk factors compared to their completely sedentary peers. Those who were more active also had a lower risk of high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\nHowever, those who were in the overweight or obese categories were at a significantly higher risk for cardiovascular disease regardless if they were otherwise “regularly active.”\n\nThose who were regularly active but obese were twice as likely to have high cholesterol, five times as likely to have high blood pressure, and were four times more likely to have diabetes compared to the participants who were normal weight, but didn’t meet the minimum activity guidelines. Those in the overweight category also were at an increased risk despite their activity level, though the increases in cardiovascular risk were less dramatic.\n\nThere’s just one problem: this latest study didn’t actually measure fitness.\n\n## Cardiorespiratory fitness counts\n\nIt’s hard to describe individual fitness by the WHO guidelines alone. Walking the dog for 20 minutes (which is a perfectly great activity!) checks the box for meeting those requirements; so does doing short interval workouts every day. But a study that just looks at meeting the guidelines doesn’t give a clear picture of what people are actually doing; let alone how fit or not they are.\n\nIt’s also challenging to assert that you can’t be fit if you’re fat—anyone who is clinically defined as overweight, but has run marathons, can tell you that. In fact, research that investigates cardiorespiratory fitness specifically (not just whether or not you get the minimum amount of active minutes according to the guidelines) paints a different picture.\n\nSpecifically, a 2014 meta-analysis titled “Fatness vs. Fitness on All-Cause Mortality,” published in *Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases* investigated the impact of your cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by VO2 max, and your BMI on risk of death from any cause. It concluded that risk of death was dependent on your fitness levels, not your BMI.\n\nThat research concluded that people who were fit—whether they were normal weight, overweight, or obese—all had similar risks of dying from any cause. On the other hand, unfit people had twice the risk of dying of any cause regardless of their BMI.\n\n“Optimal body weight is different for each individual,” says exercise scientist Vaughn Barry, Ph.D., of Middle Tennessee State University who was the lead author of the 2014 *Fatness vs Fitness *study. “You could have a BMI higher than what the charts say is optimal and be running 18 miles a week and be healthy. Being fit removes and lowers a lot of health risks.”\n\nRecent research also shows that more exercise means more protection (a.k.a. exceeding the minimum requirements might be the ticket for some people). In a 2021 study of more than 90,000 people published in *PLOS Medicine, *researchers found that those who logged the most physical activity—measured as moderate-intensity, vigorous-intensity, or as total volume—had about a 60-percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease than those who logged minimal amounts of activity.\n\nOther research has found that for every 1 MET, or “metabolic equivalent,” increase in exercise capacity, the risk of early death from any cause decreases an average of 17 percent; that goes up to 25 percent for people who are categorized as obese. By the time you reach 7.5 METs of exercise capacity, risk of early death from any cause is similar to those of normal weight and those classified as obese, according to a study published in the *American Journal of Hypertension.*\n\nRunning a 12-minute mile is categorized as an 8 MET activity according to the scientific Adult Compendium of Physical Activities, which assigns MET intensities to nearly every physical activity.\n\nThat study concluded, “These findings suggest that it is more beneficial to be fit and overweight or obese rather than normal weight and unfit.”\n\n## Body composition matters\n\nThat’s not to say there aren’t inherent risks that are associated with high levels of body fat, particularly the kind that sits deep in your abdomen—that can cause inflammation in the body and is among the factors that can increase your risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. (It is also worth noting that BMI doesn’t tell you anything about body composition; nor does it accurately reflect whether athletes—who have high amounts of muscle—are actually “overweight.”)\n\nLosing body fat and increasing muscle can definitely improve health in some people, as can eating well, reducing stress, and getting quality sleep. In the big picture, though excess fat can pose health risks, you can still be fit, and yes, you can still be healthy. The most important thing is to keep moving and work with a health professional who will help you keep tabs on all the rest.\n\n“Fitness versus fatness has been an academic debate over the last 20 years,” Tim Church, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D., of Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University, one of the country’s leading physicians in exercise and obesity research, tells *Bicycling*. “What is not debatable is the power of movement at any weight. No matter your age, weight, or health conditions,regular physical activity promotes better health and general quality of life.”\n\n**Bottom line:** It’s clear that meeting the minimum WHO exercise guidelines was not especially protective for those in the higher BMI categories in this study. But the study doesn’t shut the door on the decades-long debate as some headlines suggest. One study can never do that. It also doesn’t conclude that you can’t be “fit and fat” or that “fitness” itself is not especially protective, as other studies have over the past 20 years.', 0, '2021-03-09 19:57:09', '2021-03-10 18:49:31', '/resources/images/close-up-of-athlete-using-smartwatch-royalty-free-image-1612966263.jpg', 'https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a35495183/fat-and-fit-study/', 0, 0);

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nAs a part-Okinawan child growing up in South Carolina, it was hard to know my heritage when surrounded by churches and Chick-fil-As. So, every Saturday, my parents and I ate lunch at a Japanese restaurant, often followed by a trip to a two-room Japanese market nestled in the woods off the highway. My family all got something out of this; my dad picked up his favorite rice crackers with wasabi peas, my mom got mochi cakes, and I loaded the cart with chewybotan candies wrapped in edible rice paper, tiny boxes offruit-flavored gum balls,juicy jelly cups, and more. I loved that magical little market. While daily life seemed to tell me that I wasweird and different from my friends and everyone around me, those snacks showed me how special my identity was.\r\n\r\nIn college, I took Japanese for a year, and at the end my class traveled to Japan. There, the market aisles of my childhood exploded into a Willy Wonka–esque fever dream. There were shops and supermarkets *everywhere*, not to mention vending machines filled with treats anddrinks that looked and tasted like nothing I’d had before. Lavender ice cream, fizzy peach soda, ramen-flavored crackers, and many more tasty, textured snacks I can’t even describe because I’m not sure *what* they were. It was delightful, but then I flew back to the States, and that was that.\r\n\r\nUntil last year, that is, when I was sent a package fromBokksu, a Japanese snacksubscription service. I wasn’t sure what to expect but was delighted to find the box stuffed with goodies. The company thoughtfully included a pamphlet that explained the snacks, which was helpful since the names printed on their *kawaii* (cute), cartoon-illustrated wrappers were, of course, written totally in Japanese. The snacks ranged from savory (tiny pickled plum-flavored potato sticks, crunchy edamame crackers, roasted sesame-seed rounds) to sweet (a pear and cheese biscuit, handmade yuzu-sake hard candies, freeze-dried strawberries filled with chocolate, matcha chocolate stick cakes, and more). There was even a genmaicha brown rice green tea.\r\n\r\nUnlike a lot of similar subscription snack services that send snacks (like Pocky, say) that you can find in most Asian markets in the United States, Bokksu boxes are filled with curated snacks and tea pairings sourced directly from snack makers in Japan. \r\n\r\nThe founder, Danny Taing, studied Japanese in Japan and fell in love with the country’s *oishii* (delicious)foods, as I did. Working with artisans, his company only selects gourmet goodies that are the hardest to find outside Japan—i.e., when my mom tried to buy a candy from the box that she liked online, she couldn’t find it. Bokksu has a solution for that too. You can subscribe to a monthly box of surprise snacks, buy a one-off for yourself or as agift (forLunar New Year, maybe?), *or* you can shop for the individual items from their boxes on theBokksu Market. This is great in case you fall in love with anything (which you very well may).\r\n\r\nMy favorite aspect of the box was that there were a few samples of each of the 15 snacks, leaving enough for me to send my parents too. We were able to share them together over Zoom, reminding me of the Saturdays of my childhood, an experience that was especially meaningful in a time when we are far apart. We’ve always talked about traveling to Japan as a family, and though we can’t right now, Bokksu’s snacks were a whimsical, worthy substitute in the meantime.\r\n\r\n![Image may contain: Confectionery, Food, Sweets, Box, and First Aid](/resources/images/bokksu.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Bokksu Classic Gift Box (3-month subscription)', 0, '2021-03-09 20:10:59', '2021-03-10 19:25:17', '/resources/images/SELF_giftbox.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/bokksu-box-review', 1, 0);

Cooking and eating are activities that bring people together to enjoy a shared experience. But in some cases, the experience can be triggering—especially if you have a complex relationship with food. If you find yourself walking away from mealtime with family feeling upset, anxious, resentful, or otherwise not so great, it may mean it’s time to set some boundaries around food.\r\n\r\n“Most people who are looking to set up some boundaries around food with their family are usually doing so because they’re trying to make some sort of a change for themselves,”Monica Kelly, L.C.S.W., in Round Rock, Texas, tells SELF. Whether they are seeking to improve their relationship with food or their body, or changing their diet for whatever reason, it can be hard to implement a food-related change when food traditions run deep.\r\n\r\nOne reason is because, for many families, food isn’t just food.\r\n\r\n“Food represents culture and history, and it can be a way that people build community, find comfort, and feel like they belong,”Mishay Butler-Ozore, LMFT, in Southern California, tells SELF. This can make for a messy situation when someone wants to break the mold. “Family members can feel like you’re rejecting them—like you’re not just resisting a food or recipe, but resisting generations and history,” Butler-Ozore says. “It can become very personal for some families.”\r\n\r\nSetting boundaries allows you to be open and honest about your needs. Ideally, it can keep you from feeling disrespected by your loved ones and harboring feelings of resentment and vice versa. And, if necessary, it can open the door to finding other, mutually enjoyable ways to connect and build your relationships, Butler-Ozore says.\r\n\r\nEven if yourfamily gatherings are limited (or nonexistent) right now, family tension probably isn’t going to magically go away (sorry). For some people, it may even be looming in their minds as an unwelcome part ofgetting back to “normal” life. Having a plan ahead of time can make it a lot easier—and get you looking forward to the next big family gathering, whenever that may be.\r\n\r\nHere’s how experts recommend setting boundaries around food that both you and your family members can feel good about.\r\n\r\n## 1. Do the internal work first.\r\n\r\n“The number one thing I tell clients is that you have to internally be clear about what your boundaries are and grant yourself permission to have those boundaries,”Danielle Locklear, LMFT, in Austin, tells SELF. “When we\'re not clear about our boundaries and have not internally reconciled them and given ourselves energetic permission to have them, that’s when we can sort of get bulldozed by people.”\r\n\r\nSimply put: If you want other people to accept and respect your boundaries, you have to accept and respect them first.\r\n\r\nSo how do you do that? Butler-Ozore suggests asking yourself some questions: What is the change you’re trying to make? Why do you want to make it? Why is it so important to you? Maybe it’s that you’d like toban certain body-related comments or diet talk from the dinner table, or maybe your boundary is related to a specific dietary change you’re making and you know your family is going to push back. Whatever it is, it’s important to define it in your mind first. “If you’re not sure why you even feel the way you do, it’s harder to set a boundary,” she says. You may end up setting a boundary based on what’s comfortable for everyone else, not based on what you need.\r\n\r\nGiving yourself this permission can be tricky. “A lot of people don\'t believe they have a right to set boundaries with family,” Butler-Ozore says. “You feel like you don\'t deserve to get what you need or that they don\'t care what you need, and those are the thoughts you have to fight before you even face family members.”\r\n\r\nOnce you are clear about what you need, remind yourself that you have a right to ask for it. You can respect your family and know that your needs are important at the same time, Butler-Ozore says.\r\n\r\n## 2. Plan out the conversation—and practice it.\r\n\r\nFirst, decide who you’re going to speak with. Maybe it’s the person who is saying or doing things that rub against the boundary you want to set. Maybe it’s a parent who you can get on board first so they can help wrangle the rest of the family.\r\n\r\nThen think abouthow you’re going to say it. Everyone’s family is different, so the language and tone you use with your family will differ from the one you use with other people, says Locklear. It’s worth spending some time thinking about how you communicate best with your family, and how they might react to what you have to say. For instance, the conversation may warrant a very serious or more lighthearted tone depending on what feels most natural with your family and what they generally respond to. It may also depend on whom specifically you’re speaking to.\r\n\r\n“There may be some folks who are like, ‘Okay, cool sounds good, I will do my best to honor that,’ and then there are other folks who will not respond in that way,” Kelly says. If you can anticipate their reaction, you’ll be more prepared for how to handle the whole conversation.\r\n\r\nOnce you figure out the language you’re going to use, write it down. Then say it out loud to yourself while looking in a mirror, Locklear suggests. “Things sound different in our heads than when we say them for the first time,” she says. “It could come out robotic or stuffy sounding, and for a lot of families and cultures, they\'re going to be thrown off.”\r\n\r\nThink about how you can put your request into your own words so that it feels right. And then get comfortable saying it out loud. Seriously, practice it a few times like you would a speech or presentation, so that your brain is used to it and comfortable with it by the time the actual conversation happens.\r\n\r\n## 3. Bring it up at a neutral time.\r\n\r\nLike any other potentially sensitive conversation, you want to bring up the boundary talk ideally in a neutral moment, Locklear says: “Families tend to have emotionally charged relationships. When doing something that might feel scary or new or breaking down a relational pattern, we want to do it in a neutral moment.”\r\n\r\nIn person is usually best, Locklear says, though bringing up over the phone or via email or text first may be helpful in some situations (or necessary thanks to the pandemic). “If you think someone may have a big reaction to your boundary,” she says, “it can be an act ofself-care to have that conversation over phone or email to allow them space to have said emotional response, and then revisit the discussion once they\'ve settled.”\r\n\r\nA phone call ahead of time can also help set a shared expectation, Locklear says. For example: “Yes, I would love to join you for a picnic, but just so you know, I’m not drinking this month so I won’t be able to have wine.” This can get everyone on the same page so that there are no surprises (if that’s something you think would be useful for someone in your family).\r\n\r\nMost Popular\r\n\r\n- ​\r\n\r\n  A Lower Body Dumbbell Workout to Fire Up Your Butt and Legs\r\n\r\n  By Christa Sgobba\r\n\r\n- ​\r\n\r\n  What Is ‘COVID Arm’?

If you can establish your boundary well in advance—say, a month before the holiday or gathering in question—it can give them time and space to have their reaction, Locklear says.\r\n\r\nUltimately, you’ll need to figure out what time or place or method your family will be most receptive to.\r\n\r\n## 4. Follow the DEARMAN tactic.\r\n\r\nButler-Ozore suggests using a technique from dialectical behavioral therapy that’s focused on effective interpersonal communication, known by the acronym DEARMAN. “It can help people learn how to ask for something that they want from others,” she says. Here’s what it stands for and how to use it:\r\n\r\n- Describe the situation. Stick to the facts. *“Dieting and weight come up often at the dinner table, and I’m not okay with it.”*\r\n- Express your feelings. *“I’m trying to develop**a healthier relationship with food**, and this sort of talk makes it very difficult for me to do that. It also makes me not want to attend family meals.”*\r\n- Assert what you would like to happen. *“I’d like if everyone could please stop talking about dieting and weight loss when we’re at the dinner table.”*\r\n- Reinforce why they should care. What’s the reward? *“This will help make me feel comfortable again at family meals, and give us an opportunity to talk about other things and really bond as a family.”*\r\n- Maintain, or stay mindful and focused on what you’re hoping to get out of the conversation: the boundary you set out to create in the first place.\r\n- Appear confident. Easier said than done, but remind yourself that you deserve to create and uphold boundaries for your own well-being.\r\n- Negotiate. Be willing to give a little in order to get. That doesn’t mean you need to give up your boundary or concede. It just means you might need to offer some creative solutions to their concerns that don’t require you to compromise on what ultimately makes you feel comfortable and respected. *“I’d be happy to come up with a conversation starter at the beginning of the meal so we can start to focus on other, more positive things when we are together.”*\r\n\r\nMost Popular\r\n\r\n- ​\r\n\r\n  A Lower Body Dumbbell Workout to Fire Up Your Butt and Legs\r\n\r\n  By Christa Sgobba\r\n\r\n- ​\r\n\r\n  What Is ‘COVID Arm’?

Only you can determine how much negotiating you’re willing to do before you undermine your own boundary. If you’ve offered alternative solutions and no longer have any suggestions that keep you within your boundary, it might be time to stop and recognize that the other person might just not be ready to respect your boundary right now (read on for more on that).\r\n\r\n## 5. Accept what you can control and what you can’t.\r\n\r\nSetting boundaries isn’t always going to go perfectly. Especially when they’re related to messy things like family and food. That’s okay.\r\n\r\n“When we set boundaries with anyone, there’s likely to be disappointment, especially if we’re breaking a relational dynamic we’ve had with that person over time,” Locklear says. “They might be disappointed, and it’s okay for people to get disappointed. That’s not your work to do, that’s theirs.”\r\n\r\nWhat she means by that is: It’s your responsibility to clearly communicate what you need, but the way other people react is not your responsibility.\r\n\r\nIt all comes back to honoring your needs andyour energy. “You can communicate your boundary and remind people when they are brushing up against it,” Locklear says, “but you don’t need to be available to keep defending yourself over and over again or energy use energy to keep explaining yourself if someone is not available to listen.” \r\n\r\n## 6. Decide when it’s time to move on.\r\n\r\nThis type of work can be really difficult, Kelly says. “It’s really difficult to divest from a system while living within that system, so it’s important to be careful with where your energy is.” Even after approaching this the best way possible, there still might be some people who don’t get it. It’s okay to reinforce your boundaries more firmly if they’re not understanding, Kelly says. It’s also okay to walk away from it if it’s costing you more energy than you can spare.\r\n\r\n“Be in tune with where you are and be patient and graceful with yourself when you can’t be as direct with boundaries,” she says. That might mean having to change some of your behaviors instead so that you can still honor your needs in whatever way you can. Maybe that means leaving the room when food conversations come up or taking a break from one specific person who is really not accepting or respecting your boundaries.\r\n\r\nMaybe that means not going to family events where food will be present. “As hard as that can be, the point is to get yourself into a place where you can be emotionally and mentally well to be around them,” Kelly says. It could also mean getting creative about how you do connect. Suggest a different activity that doesn’t center on a meal, like afamily game night.\r\n\r\nSetting boundaries is an important exercise in patience. “We can\'t just flip a switch and start a new familial pattern and expect there won’t be any opposition to it,” Locklear says. “We’re such an instant gratification culture, we want answers and quick fixes, and we find ourselves unwilling to stay in discomfort. But if people are really showing up for those hard, uncomfortable conversations, there’s really something beautiful on the other side of it.”', 0, '2021-03-09 20:11:48', '2021-03-10 19:26:59', '/resources/images/lobster_meal.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/setting-boundaries-around-food', 1, 0);

', '![How Much Protein Do You Need in a Day](/resources/images/protein_food.jpeg)Nadine Greeff/Adobe Stock\r\n\r\nEven if you’re not exactly sure what protein is technically—or how much protein you need—odds are that you do know how good it makes you feel. Whether you like to start your day with a fillingegg scramble, chug the nutrient in shake form after a workout, or cook up a nice steak (or piece oftofu) for dinner, you’re likely familiar with the lasting satisfaction that you get from protein in its many delicious variations. And, as we’ll talk about, protein certainly does enough to earn its reliably good reputation.\r\n\r\nWhile you know protein is a great thing to have, you might also have a few questions. Like, why exactly does your body need it? How *much* protein do you need to eat, and when should you eat it? And how does your activity level factor into that? Here’s a rundown of what protein does and how much of the nutrient your body needs.\r\n\r\n## What protein actually is\r\n\r\nProtein is one of the three macronutrients (i.e. nutrients the body needs in sizable amounts). Unlike carbs and fat, protein is not usually a major energy source, although we definitely get some of that from it—protein provides four calories per gram. But protein is often referred to as a building block in the body because of its central role in growth and development.\r\n\r\nAlmost all animal-derived products—meat, poultry, eggs, dairy, fish—contain a significant amount of protein, so they get labeled as protein sources when we’re talking about our diets and nutrition. Butprotein is also present in a lot of plant-based foods. There’s a good amount in beans, peas, nuts, and seeds, for instance, while vegetables and grains generally contain smaller amounts, according to theU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Whole grains will have more protein than refined grains, though, which are missing the part of the grain that often supplies a lot of the protein content, asSELF previously reported.\r\n\r\nProteins are made of small units called amino acids. There are 20 different amino acids in total, which can be broken down into two main groups, per theFDA. Nine of the 20 are what are referred to as *essential* amino acids, meaning that the body is unable to produce them itself and so we must get them from food. The other 11 are *nonessential* because the body is able to synthesize them out of the essential amino acids or the normal process of breaking down proteins, according to theU.S. National Library of Medicine.\r\n\r\nNow when a protein is a good source of all nine of the essential amino acids, we call it a complete protein, according to theFDA. All animal products are complete proteins, and so is soy. When a protein is missing or pretty low in any of those essential amino acids, it’s considered incomplete. Most plant foods are considered incomplete proteins.\r\n\r\nThe good news for vegetarians, vegans, and lovers of plant foods in general is that you can still easily get all the essential amino acids from eating a wide variety of incomplete proteins. As theFDA explains, incomplete proteins are often just lacking in one or two amino acids, so they can often make up for whatever the other one is lacking. For instance, grains are low in an amino acid called lysine, while beans and nuts are low in methionine. But when you eat, say, beans and rice or wheat toast with nut butter, you’re getting all the amino acids that you do when you eat, say, chicken. While people used to be encouraged to eat foods in combinations at meals, we now know this is not necessary, according to theU.S. National Library of Medicine, as long as you’re eating a variety of complementary incomplete proteins throughout the day.\r\n\r\n## Why we even need protein\r\n\r\nThat building block nickname is no exaggeration. The stuff is an integral component of every cell in your body, including, yes, your muscles.\r\n\r\nWATCH\r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\n“If we don\'t get enough protein, our bodies actually won’t be able to rebuild properly and we’ll start to lose muscle mass,”Colleen Tewksbury, Ph.D., M.P.H., R.D., senior research investigator and bariatric program manager at Penn Medicine and president of the Pennsylvania Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nProtein helps repair the microtears that occur in your muscle fibers when they’re strained during exercise, theAmerican College of Exercise (ACE) explains. That process of damage and repair is what maintains and grows your muscle mass.\r\n\r\nBut protein is not just important for people who work out: In addition to muscle growth and repair, protein is essential to the growth and repair of virtually *all* cells and body tissues—from your skin, hair, and nails to your bones, organs, and bodily fluids, according to theFDA. That’s why it’s especially important to get enough of it during developmental periods like childhood and adolescence.\r\n\r\nProtein also plays a role in crucial bodily functions like blood clotting, immune system response, vision, fluid balance, and the production of various enzymes and hormones, per theFDA. And because it contains calories, it can provide the body energy for storage or use. (But this definitely isn’t its main gig, which we’ll get into in a bit.)\r\n\r\n## What happens in your body when you eat protein\r\n\r\nIt’s not like you eat a piece of chicken and that protein goes directly to your biceps. Dietary protein gets broken down and reassembled into the various kinds of proteins that exist in the body. No matter what kind of protein you’re eating—plant or animal, complete or incomplete—your body’s first objective is to break it back down into all the different amino acid units it was assembled from, Dr. Tewksbury explains, through the digestive process.\r\n\r\nThen those little singular amino acids get reconfigured (by the liver) into whatever kind of protein your body needs. For instance, some proteins in the body make up antibodies that help the immune system fight bacteria and viruses. Others help with DNA synthesis, chemical reactions, or transporting other molecules, theNational Institute of General Medical Sciences explains.\r\n\r\nSince your body can’t store excess protein, it will break down any protein it doesn’t need right away and usually stow it away in fat tissue (as triglycerides), according toMerck Manuals. Rarely, if your body is in a fasting state or not getting enough calories coming in from other macronutrients, broken-down protein can be converted into glucose and used for emergency fuel,Whitney Linsenmeyer, Ph.D., R.D., nutrition and dietetics instructor in the Doisy College of Health Sciences at Saint Louis University and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, tells SELF. But this is not typical, because the body prefers carbs as its primary source of energy (followed by dietary fat, if the body isnot getting enough carbs). “We *can* adapt to use protein for energy as well, but it’s not ideal,” Dr. Linsenmeyer says. “Ideally, [our bodies] want to leave it alone to build and maintain body tissues.”\r\n\r\n## How much protein your body needs\r\n\r\nOkay, so how much protein are we talking about here? The amount of protein your body actually requires for the purpose of tissue growth and repair is determined by factors like sex, age, height, weight, health, activity level, and overall calorie need, according to theU.S. National Library of Medicine. So it’s going to vary a lot from person to person.\r\n\r\nA good starting point for roughly estimating minimum protein needs is therecommended daily allowance (RDA) for protein, or the average minimum daily intake that’s sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements (i.e. prevent a deficiency) for most healthy individuals (who are sedentary or minimally active). The RDA for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, or about 0.36 grams per pound. (So you would multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36 to get your RDA.) For instance, the average 200-pound person needs at least 72 grams of protein per day to meet the RDA.\r\n\r\nPeople with a higher activity level will likely need more. Individuals who work out and want to maintain and/or build muscle mass through diet and exercise definitely benefit from getting more protein than the RDA,Adam M. Gonzalez, Ph.D., C.S.C.S., assistant professor in the Department of Health Professions at Hofstra University,has told SELF.\r\n\r\nHow much more, exactly, depends on factors like how much you exercise and your body composition goals, asSELF has reported—as well as who you ask. Several large organizations—theAcademy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Academy), Dietitians of Canada (DC), and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)01802-X/fulltext)—reviewed the research on sports nutrition and agreed that the optimal daily protein intake for active adults and athletes is 1.2 to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight (or 0.5 to 0.9 grams of protein per pound). Similarly, theInternational Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) recommends 1.4 to 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (or 0.6 to 0.9 grams of protein per pound) for most individuals who are working out.\r\n\r\nBased on those recommendations, for instance, a 200-pound person would want to get between 100 and 180 grams of protein a day. Generally, the more active you are—the more frequent, strenuous, and long your workouts are—the higher in that range you’ll be, Dr. Gonzalez says.\r\n\r\n## How you should space out your protein intake\r\n\r\nWhen you eat your protein is just as important as how much you eat. It’s not about simply loading up after exercising or at one meal and skimping on it for the rest of the day. Like we mentioned, the body doesn’t have a protein holding tank like it does for carbs, where it can siphon away extras for quick access when we need it.\r\n\r\nThat’s why the best way to get your protein is split up throughout the day. Eating a good amount of protein at different points in the day helps your body direct protein where it’s needed, when it’s needed—not to mention, keeps you feeling satisfied and energized. So take a look at your daily amount (the recommendations above), and see how you can break that up in your various meals throughout the day.\r\n\r\nSpacing out protein intake is also super important for active individuals. That’s because muscle repair and growth are “greater when you consume adequate protein at breakfast, lunch, and dinner,” Dr. Linsenmeyer explains. Yes, “protein is vital after a workout,”Yasi Ansari, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D., national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and assistant director of Performance Nutrition for UC Berkeley Athletics, haspreviously told SELF. “But it is important for people to know that more [all at once] is not necessarily better.”\r\n\r\nYour muscles are going to be hungrier for protein for at least 24 hours after exercising, Dr. Gonzalez says—so basically, most of the time, if you work out most days. The Academy/DC/ACSM recommend getting 15 to 25 grams of protein (or 0.25 to 0.3 grams per kilogram of body weight) about every three to five hours to maximize muscle repair. The ISSN suggests getting 20 to 40 grams (or 0.25 grams per kilogram of body weight) every three hours or so. So a good target combining those ranges is 20 to 30 grams of protein at a time, asSELF has explained. If you want to get a bit more precise, convert your body weight in pounds to kilograms (divide your weight in pounds by 2.2), and multiply that number by 0.25 or 0.3. So for a 200-pound person, for instance, that works out to 23 to 27 grams of protein.\r\n\r\nYou want a similar amount after working out, too, when your muscles need immediate repair. How much protein your muscles can take in after exercising depends on things like the type and intensity of your workout and your body composition, Ansari explains—so lifting weights for an hour, for example, will make your muscles thirstier for protein than a 30-minute cardio workout. In general, though, theAcademy/DC/ACSM01802-X/fulltext) recommend getting that same protein hit (15 to 25 grams of protein, or 0.25 to 0.3 grams per kilogram of body weight) within two hours of exercising in order to maximize muscle repair, while the ISSN again recommends aiming for 20 to 40 grams (or 0.25 grams per kilogram of body weight).\r\n\r\nThe bottom line on protein? This nutrient is vital to our bodies, so you want to get at least the recommended minimum no matter what. If you work out, get a good bit more than that. And instead of loading up at one meal, spread the protein love throughout your day.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:13:15', '2021-03-10 19:26:59', '/resources/images/protein_food.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/what-protein-does-in-your-body', 1, 0);

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nIf you recently glanced around yourkitchen and decided you need something new: Welcome! Allow me to talk at length about the Ninja Foodi 5-in-1 Indoor Grill. It air-fries,bakes, dehydrates, roasts, and grills. Does my studio apartment kitchen corner need all of this? Yes, it does.\r\n\r\nLike so many other people, I was in the market for a standard air fryer and couldn’t decide what I needed. People kept telling me I should get one, but they couldn’t tell me why. I eventually realized thatair fryers serve up evenly crisp dishes fast and with less oil than deep frying. But after poring over things like voltage and size, I wasn’t sure that I’d make the most of one. I haven’t cooked meat in over two years—would I get bored with French fries and crispy cauliflowerair fryer recipes? That I’d have more than an air fryer is what made the Ninja Foodi 5-in-1 Indoor Grill ($210,Amazon) so appealing. I figured more features would increase my odds of using it regularly.\r\n\r\nThe appliance features a removable four-quart air fryer basket that nests inside a larger basin where you can roast, bake, or dehydrate to your heart’s content. There’s also an attachment that sits atop the basin and allows you to grill food indoors (up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit), achieving a char grill flavor without turning your kitchen into a cloud of smoke. All of these features are controlled by an easy-to-use digital interface.\r\n\r\nThe more than12,000 mostly glowing Amazon reviews, many of which noted that you can grill indoors with “minimal smoke” involved, eventually won me over. It turns out the reviewers were right. This five-in-one appliance is well worth the price tag. I’ve found that it replaces my toaster, I pan-fry food less often, and grilling indoorveggies has become a real treat. If grilling and air frying are high on your priority list, then I’d say you should go for it.\r\n\r\nI haven’t used the dehydration feature, but one reviewer remarked that smaller batches work best. And many reviewers commented that the roasting feature makes for tender chicken and other meat dishes. Some reviewers say they’ve baked cakes with the appliance, and—given the easy digital interface and size—I don’t see why this wouldn’t be true (if you’re interested, there areYouTube tutorials to help).\r\n\r\nCleanup is also relatively easy, requiring just a grill brush or Brillo pad, but fair warning that it’s not the most compact unit or the quietest. If you’re a person who makes midnight meals, the Ninja Foodi 5-in-1 Indoor Grill is significantly louder than amicrowave, FYI.\r\n\r\nUltimately, during a year when I’ve made some regrettable purchases (hello, pizza stone), the Ninja Foodi 5-in-1 Indoor Grill is still a major win. While I haven’t baked a cake or made dried apple slices just yet, knowing that I can is half the fun.\r\n\r\n![product image](/resources/images/ninja_foodi.png)\r\n\r\n## Ninja Foodi 5-in-1 Indoor Electric Countertop Grill\r\n\r\nYou can bake, roast, air fry, dehydrate, and grill with this versatile indoor appliance.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:14:09', '2021-03-10 19:28:15', '/resources/images/SELF_favninja.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/ninja-foodi-5-in-1-indoor-grill', 0, 0);

Add to that the regular seasonal toxic messaging—the post-holiday diet talk, or the pressure to “get in shape” for spring and summer—and you have a perfect storm for disordered thoughts and eating behaviors.\r\n\r\nFacing a gamut of triggers and unable to rely on their usual support mechanisms, many individuals may find themselves grappling with a sense of feeling out of control around food. For some, this might surface as a compulsion to overeat oreat emotionally; for others, it can be an urge to binge on certain foods. These impulses can manifest in serious mental health conditions like bulimia or binge eating disorder, though not everyone who experiences these urges will meet the diagnostic criteria for a specific eating disorder.\r\n\r\nThere are tons of reasons for why you may be feeling out of control around food—and there’s likely not one simple trigger that’s responsible for it.\r\n\r\n“This could be the result of biology, emotions, or the environment—and most likely, a combination of several of these factors,”Marian Tanofsky-Kraff, Ph.D., a professor of medical and clinical psychology at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences who researches eating disorders, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nBecause there are such varied causes, there’s also not one singular way to help thwart that out-of-control feeling. As someone whostarted recovering from bulimia seven years ago, I can tell you that multiple strategies are often necessary. Here are six actionable, expert-backed tips that may help if you’re struggling with food-related anxiety or, in particular, that unnerving feeling of being out of control when it comes to what you eat.\r\n\r\n## 1. Do your best to eat regularly.\r\n\r\nSkipping meals or restricting food can be a reason some people tend to feel a loss of control around food. So a key way to combat this feeling—though this can be much easier said than done—is to eat sufficiently so that you’re satiated and not constantly thinking about hunger.\r\n\r\n“Eating regularly is a big piece of overcoming out-of-control eating,”Saniha H. Makhzoumi, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist in Maryland who specializes in the treatment of eating disorders, tells SELF. “When we aren\'t eating enough or we avoid certain foods, we begin to feel deprived. In response to this, our bodies seek out food, especially ones that we told ourselves were off-limits.”\r\n\r\nSo Dr. Makhzoumi recommends trying to eat regularly. For some people that could look like three meals a day plus a snack when you’re hungry. But remember, this is super individualized, and a “regular” eating schedule is likely going to look different for each person. What’s more important than a set number of meals or snacks is to make sure you’re eating enough throughout the day so that you’re not experiencing frequent hunger pangs. Dr. Makhzoumi also takes an “all-foods-fit” approach in her practice, advising her clients to consume everything in moderation (barring any medical/religious restrictions).\r\n\r\n“If we allow ourselves to eat the foods that we crave, we can move on with our day rather than becoming preoccupied with that food,” Dr. Makhzoumi says. This is similar tointuitive eating, an approach whereby people don’t intentionally try to control their eating and instead focus on tuning into their senses of hunger and satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOf course, eating regularly can be a difficult task for someone who does feel out of control around food or who has had issues with eating before. In those cases, resources like the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA)helpline, or meeting with an eating disorder treatment counselor, can be helpful as you navigate that.\r\n\r\nAs I moved through the earlier part of my recovery journey, I gradually moved to an intuitive-eating framework. I eat when I’m hungry and stop when I’m full, and I give myself permission to have what I desire. I’ve learned to build trust around food by responding to what my body needs and wants rather than relying on external rules to guide my choices.\r\n\r\n## 2. Challenge and rephrase negative food talk.\r\n\r\nReframing unhelpful thoughts and beliefs is a crucial step toward food freedom. This often entails letting go of rigid rules about what, when, and how much we should eat, which fuel feelings of powerlessness around food.\r\n\r\nDiet rules are usually difficult to maintain, says Dr. Makhzoumi, so when we eat something we demonize, we can feel like a failure. This leads to an all-or-nothing mindset: “We figure, ‘I broke this rule, I might as well keep going and start again fresh tomorrow,’” says Dr. Makhzoumi. As a result, many people find themselves vacillating between eating to the point of discomfort and restricting.\r\n\r\nI’m mindful of the language that surrounds eating, whether it’s the self-deprecating self-talk looping inside my head or the negative food andbody talk in conversations with others. While I predominantly make what I consider to be“healthy” food choices, I refuse to label certain foods as “good,” “bad,” and “off-limits.” In turn, mealtimes are no longer the emotional battlefield they once were.\r\n\r\nOne way to approach this reframing is through cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), an evidence-based intervention that’s highly effective for rooting out negative thought patterns and formulating a healthier perspective. It involves examining the validity of our unhelpful cognitions (e.g., “I ate badly yesterday,” “I shouldn’t be eating this dessert,” or “I can only have a salad for dinner”), then reevaluating them and coming up with more balanced alternative beliefs (e.g., “There’s nothing wrong with indulging in something I enjoy,” or “I don’t need to compensate for past meals”).\r\n\r\nWhile many people receive CBT with a therapist (more on that below), I’ve benefited from usingself-help books to practice it on my own (one of my favorites is*Overcoming Bulimia Nervosa and Binge-Eating*). There are also many tutorials available online by licensed mental health professionals, including on YouTube, where you can learn and understand the concepts of CBT and how to apply them to your life. Practicing CBT tactics a few times a month is like getting the oil in my car changed regularly: It makes it easier for me to notice and manage the undercurrent of emotions in day-to-day life before they cross over into unwanted behaviors.\r\n\r\n## 3. Address your emotions directly.\r\n\r\nAnother reason a person may feel out of control around food is due to challenging emotions like stress or sadness, says Dr. Makhzoumi. Many of us have learned to use eating as a way to manage our feelings. That’s why it can help to give ourselves a moment to pause and self-reflect so that we can work to unravel the root cause of our emotions rather than turn to food as a way to numb or escape them.\r\n\r\nWhilestudies have shown that comfort eating isn’t necessarily a bad thing andcan serve as a valid coping mechanism, it’s also important to develop alternative ways to regulate our emotions. Again, this is an instance when a therapist can come in to help you understand and deal with the underlying stressors in your life in a more sustainable way.\r\n\r\nBut there are things you can do on your own too. Dr. Makhzoumi recommendsjournaling as a form of self-monitoring, namely recording and tracking when you feel out of control and the behaviors associated with it. This can promote awareness and accountability, as well as pinpoint possible triggers and patterns in how we feel and behave. Things to record might include how you felt, what you ate, where you were, and what was going on at that particular time. By tapping into your feelings and emotions—a process known as emotional regulation—you can give them time and space rather than pushing them down (here aresome tips to use this technique effectively).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the years I’ve used a variety of therapeutic tools.Meditation has helped create space for thoughts to feel less urgent and intrusive. Journaling and art have been consistently cathartic, allowing me to step back and process my emotions and experiences in a more objective and compassionate way.\r\n\r\n## 4. Do something you find pleasurable.\r\n\r\nWe often turn to food as a source of pleasure, especially if we’ve been restricting our dietary intake,Melissa I. Klein, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychology at Weill Cornell Medical College who specializes in eating disorders, tells SELF. There’s nothing inherently wrong with eating recreationally or occasionally using food as a pick-me-up. In fact, joy, joyful connection, and other positive emotions can be acentral part of forming a healthy relationship with food. However, if you think eating for pleasure is one reason you feel out of control around food, it may be helpful to develop alternative sources of pleasure and ways of responding to emotions like boredom or frustration.\r\n\r\nEngaging in an alternate activity can shift your focus away from food, says Dr. Klein. It can be helpful to have some intentional distractions up your sleeve to interrupt and relieve overwhelming thoughts and emotions.\r\n\r\nThese can be activities such as playing an instrument,taking a bath, or creating art. Eventually, you might be able to turn to these kinds of activities for comfort or pleasure in moments when you would have felt out of control while looking to food for those feelings instead.\r\n\r\n## 5. Seek out expert help.\r\n\r\nA caveat to bear in mind is that people feel out of control around food for a wide spectrum of reasons, which is why a one-size-fits-all approach is unrealistic. With that in mind, it’s important to consult with an expert, if possible, to determine the underlying causes for *why* you’re feeling out of control. That could be a physical health expert, a mental health expert, or both.\r\n\r\n“For someone whose eating is driven primarily by physiology,” says Dr. Tanofsky-Kraff, “suggesting behavior changes and activities can be not only highly frustrating but stigmatizing, which can further promote out-of-control eating, mood disorders, and physical health problems associated with stress.”\r\n\r\nIf you really don’t know why you’re feeling out of control around food, if it feels more physical than mental, or if it’s a sudden change for you, it may be helpful to see your primary care doctor to rule out physical causes. For example, conditions like diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and hyperthyroidism can cause significant increases in appetite.\r\n\r\nFinding a therapist can be intimidating if you don’t know where to start, but there arelots of resources online to offer guidance. You can also ask your doctor for a referral to a therapist who specializes in eating-related issues, and they may be able to recommend someone who’s covered by the same insurance or know about financial assistance programs that can provide support. (Thesetips on how to find the best therapist for you can also help too.)\r\n\r\nDue to theCOVID-19 crisis, there’s also an influx of therapy platforms that can offer more affordable and flexible counseling services online. A few options includeBetterHelp andTalkspace. Before using an online company, though, do some research to ensure that the service you want to try carries out its practices ethically andwill protect your privacy.\r\n\r\n## 6. Talk to someone about how you’re feeling.\r\n\r\nWhile seeking out the services of a professional therapist can undoubtedly be helpful, it might not be an option for everyone. There are varioussystemic barriers that prevent people from receiving the mental health care that they need.Some cannot afford therapy or lack the insurance to pay for it, while others may have trouble finding culturally competent therapists.\r\n\r\nBut opening up about our thoughts and emotions can be incredibly nurturing (while yep, also daunting). My disorder was often at its worst when I cut myself off from friends and family, as isolation served as fertile ground for feelings of “out of control–ness” to fester and snowball. Positive social support has been shown to promote eating disorder recovery, says Dr. Tanofsky-Kraff. Even the simple act of calling a friend and having a conversation in those moments when you feel overwhelmed might help de-escalate distressing thoughts and lighten your emotional load.\r\n\r\nAnd with the dawn of telehealth, there’s now an abundance of free or low-cost alternatives to traditional therapy that allow people to reach out and share what they’re going through rather than tackle these issues alone (again, make sure you are vetting these spaces beforehand). This includes virtual peer support chat rooms likeSupportiv andHealthfulChat, and clinician-led support groups for people with eating disorders, some of which can be found via theNEDA andEating Disorder Hope websites. These platforms give users the opportunity to be heard, validated, and emotionally supported by one another. (Still,these groups can vary greatly in practice, structure, and the credentials of those running them, which is something to keep in mind before trying one out.)\r\n\r\nThere are also numerous 12-step programs with online support group meetings that are dedicated to helping people with issues around food, includingOvereaters Anonymous,Eating Disorders Anonymous, andAnorexics and Bulimics Anonymous. These programs use an abstinence-based model in an effort to guide individuals on a journey toward healing their relationships with food and their body. Even if you don’t choose to follow the 12-steps (they aren’t for everyone), it’s possible to attend a meeting if you’re feeling particularly unsettled around food and want to connect and be part of a supportive community.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to remember that disordered eating and the thoughts that accompany it are deeply complex. You may explore different coping strategies before you find one that resonates with you. Be kind to yourself. If you’ve had a long history of dysfunctional eating and adhering to food rules, it can take some time to repair a fraught relationship with food. But it’s possible in many cases to learn to become attuned to your body and its natural signals again, and gradually feel more empowered with your eating.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:14:52', '2021-03-10 19:28:52', '/resources/images/thinking_woman.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/tips-when-feeling-out-of-control-around-food', 0, 0);

Food Stying by Drew Aichele. Prop Styling by Campbell Pearson.\r\n\r\n*Welcome to**Grocery Diaries**, a new series that illustrates just how varied and personalized “healthy eating” really is. So many factors impact the choices we make at the grocery store, including access and affordability, health conditions, our individual cultural backgrounds, even what simply makes us (and our taste buds) happy. So we asked people across the country to share their grocery lists with us, and then called up a few of them to ask for more details. Why do they buy what they buy? How much do they spend? Who are they shopping for? What health conditions or nutritional concerns are they thinking about when they choose, for instance, almond milk over cow’s milk, or particular flavors or spices or treats? In this Grocery Diaries installment, we hear from a Boston registered dietitian who makes plant-based versions of her favorite Jamaican foods.*\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n**Name:** Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes\r\n**Age:** 38\r\n**Occupation:** Registered dietitian\r\n**Location:** Boston\r\n**Race/Gender:** Black woman\r\n**Health conditions/dietary restrictions to consider:** Avoids dairy, meat, and gluten. Additionally, Sue-Ellen is a member of the Seventh-Day Adventist World Church and refrains from eating pork, crustaceans, and gelatin as many followers do.\r\n**Grocery shopping frequency:** Shops for four people three times a month\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes was tired of searching for fresh callaloo ingrocery stores, so she grew her own. “There’s a big difference between fresh and canned. The canned is okay—and I’ll eat it—but I just really love the fresh,” she tells SELF. Callaloo is a green leafy vegetable similar to kale and collard greens that is popular in Jamaica, where Sue-Ellen is from. Sue-Ellen occasionally buys canned callaloo, but nothing beats eating freshly picked greens from her garden, she says.\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen moved to the U.S. from Jamaica when she was in elementary school. Her family lived in New Jersey before settling down in Florida, where they found many of the same fresh foods they ate back home, like callaloo and ackee, a West African fruit commonly eaten in the Caribbean. Now Sue-Ellen drives about an hour from her home to downtown Boston in order to find ingredients for her favorite Jamaican dishes, since many items are not available in her neighborhood markets.\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen follows aplant-based diet because she experienced stomach pains and uncomfortable bloating whenever she ate meat—as well as dairy and gluten, so she now avoids those types of foods. Occasionally Sue-Ellen cooks chicken and fish for her husband, Michael, and her two kids, Elizabeth and Malachi, but the whole family enjoys her meat-free meals. “I cook all my traditional meals the exact same way, but I take the meat out if I’m making them for myself,” she explains. “Eating traditional foods brings up memories from home.” Grocery shopping for those foods isn’t always easy, but Sue-Ellen manages to honor her traditions. Here are 10 items she picks up in a typical grocery trip.\r\n\r\n1.Linstead Market Jamaica Callaloo: $21.99\r\n\r\nAs we mentioned, Sue-Ellen grew up eating fresh callaloo, which is hard to find in the Boston area. She buys canned callaloo when she needs to, but thetaste just isn’t the same, she says. “I like my callaloo with a little more crunch and a little less salt,” she explains. Now Sue-Ellen grows callaloo in the summer and freezes it to last through winter. She cooks it with tomatoes, peppers, and onions, to serve alongside many of her meals.\r\n\r\n2. Cristobal Salted Cod Chunks: $7.99\r\n\r\n“Sunday dinner is really big where I was born in Jamaica,” Sue-Ellen explains. She starts the day by makingackee and salt fish for breakfast. “Ackee and salt fish is our national dish in Jamaica,” she explains. (Sue-Ellen eats ackee and jackfruit to stick with her meat-free diet. “Jackfruit looks similar to salt fish when it’s broken up in pieces,” she says.) Her daughter, Elizabeth, is particularly fond of the meal and begs, “Mommy, give me dumplings and salt fish. I want to be Jamaican.” Sue-Ellen says she laughs and responds, “You are. You’re Jamerican.”\r\n\r\n3.Spur Tree Jamaican Ackee in Brine: $10.10\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen misses picking fresh ackee from the trees in Jamaica and also in Florida where her father-in-law grows his own fruit. “You can tell the difference between canned and fresh ackee for sure, but that doesn’t hinder me from eating it,” she says. In addition to preparing ackee with salt fish andjackfruit, Sue-Ellen sometimes serves it with tofu.\r\n\r\n4. Yellow Yams: $2.29\r\n\r\n“In Jamaica, we roast yellow yams over an open flame,” Sue-Ellen says. That’s not something she can do in her house now, so sheboils or bakes them instead. Sue-Ellen especially likes how the sweetness complements some spicier flavors. “It goes well with curry chickpeas. It’s like a comfort meal,” she says.\r\n\r\n5. Green Bananas: $1.49\r\n\r\nWhen eating green bananas, “it feels like I’m home again,” Sue-Ellen says. Her absolute favorite thing about green bananas is thenostalgia that comes with eating them. “My mom used to mash the green bananas and put butter on them. I remember eating that, and it tasted so good.” And they go well with nearly any meal because they taste similar to potatoes, according to Sue-Ellen.\r\n\r\n![Image may contain Fruit Plant Food Apple and Meal](/resources/images/medium11162020-SELF-CHELSEA-KYLE-1283%252520copy.jpg)\r\n\r\nChelsea Kyle. Food Stying by Drew Aichele. Prop Styling by Campbell Pearson.\r\n\r\n6. 365 Whole Foods Market Organic Mango Chunks: $6.99\r\n\r\n“I grew up eating mangoes off the tree,” Sue-Ellen says. “Some people in Jamaica eat two or three mangoes in a row. We just sit there and eat them like a meal.” Now Sue-Ellen mainly buys them frozen touse in smoothies. “Smoothies just taste so much yummier with mango,” she says.\r\n\r\n7. Plantains: $.66\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen is thankful that these are readily available in her neighborhood grocery stores. “I eat plantains at almost every single meal. I love them and they’re just a familiar food,” she says. She serves baked or boiled plantains withscrambled tofu, in her sandwiches, or on top of her salad bowls.\r\n\r\n8. Nasoya Organic Tofu Super Firm: $3.99\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen’s family loves crispy tofu, and she has two secrets to making it perfectly: buying super -firm tofu and using theright cookware. “I feel like a cast-iron pot is really helpful in making it crispy,” she says. She prepares tofu using a variety of seasonings, like grilled jerk tofu (her son’s favorite).\r\n\r\n9. The Jackfruit Company Curry Jackfruit: $5.99\r\n\r\nOne of the best things aboutjackfruit is that it’s so versatile, according to Sue-Ellen. “As long as you season it well, jackfruit takes on the flavor of your spices—just like tofu,” she says. Sue-Ellen particularly likes using this brand on busy days because it comes preseasoned in the pouch.\r\n\r\n10.Blue Mountain Country Jamaican Curry Powder: $11\r\n\r\n“I can just list so many ways of using curry,” Sue-Ellen proclaims, including curry lentils, curry soup, curry chickpeas, and yellow curry rice. Although these recipes run the gamut, Blue Mountain curry powder is a staple in all of them. “This is made with truly authentic ingredients. It’s the real stuff,” sye says.\r\n\r\n*All products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (48, 11, 'What Are Antioxidants, and How Much of Them Should You Be Eating?', 'They’re easier to take in than you may think.', '![What Are Antioxidants and How Much Should You Eat for Your Health](https://media.self.com/photos/602ff9bf9370edfeeecead74/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/food_fruits.jpeg)Jesse Morrow/Adobe Stock\n\nThere are tons of buzzwords in the nutrition field, and “antioxidants” is definitely one of them. But what are antioxidants really, and how do they affect your body?\n\nFrom ketchup to pomegranate juice, plenty of foods are known for containing antioxidants. You’ve probably heard those compounds can do a lot for your health—they’ve been touted as doing everything from preventing heart disease to cancer—but are they as helpful as people say they are?\n\nLike many things in the nutrition field, there’s a lot to unpack regarding antioxidants. And, despite marketing claims singing their praises, they’re not exactly a panacea on your dinner plate. That doesn’t mean you should discount them, though: Antioxidants can bring a bunch of benefits with them.\n\nFrom how exactly they work to how you should be taking them in (and how much), here’s what you need to know about antioxidants.\n\n## What are antioxidants?\n\nBefore talking about what an antioxidant is, it helps to understand what we mean by another wellness buzzword: “free radical.” Free radicals refer to any molecule in your body that contains an unpaired electron, which makes them very unstable and keeps them looking for other compounds to bind to. Free radicals can serve some important functions in the body, such as signaling between cells, but because they are so reactive, they can also cause damage to cells through a process called oxidative stress.\n\nYour body generates free radicals during activities like digestion and vigorous exercise, and in response to things like UV light exposure, pollution, smoking, and certain diseases, Chwan-Li (Leslie) Shen, Ph.D., associate dean for research at Texas Tech University Health Sciences, tells SELF. It’s when free radicals are produced in excess that they can become problematic.\n\nAntioxidants, on the other hand, can help keep these free radicals in check. Antioxidants are compounds—either made in your body or consumed from external sources—that help neutralize free radicals and other molecules in your body that can damage cells and tissues, Mahdi Garelnabi, Ph.D., an associate professor of biomedical and nutrition sciences at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, tells SELF. They do this through a variety of mechanisms, such as by lending an electron to a free radical to make it less reactive or by binding to a substance in a way that prevents further reactions.\n\nBy stabilizing these free radicals, antioxidants can also help your immune system function more efficiently and mitigate chronic inflammation, which is thought to be a driving force for many health problems, like cardiovascular disease and cancer. Antioxidants may also, through separate mechanisms, help repair DNA and cell membranes.\n\n## Where can you find antioxidants?\n\nYour body makes some antioxidants on its own, but sometimes that’s not enough. “A lot of times, your body generates too many free radicals, and your body cannot handle it, so external antioxidant intake is important,” Dr. Shen says.\n\nThere are thousands of antioxidants, and they are not only present in highly hyped “superfoods.” You can find antioxidants in a broad range of foods—like fruits, vegetables, seafood, whole grains, and meats—as well as in supplement form.\n\nSome antioxidants are essential vitamins that your body needs to function, while others are essential minerals. Examples of antioxidant vitamins include vitamin C (found in brussels sprouts, red cabbage, and peppers), vitamin E (found in almonds, sunflower seeds, and olive oil), and vitamin A, which your body makes from beta carotene (found in collard greens, sweet potatoes, and cantaloupe). Examples of antioxidant minerals include selenium (found in Brazil nuts, pork, and turkey) and zinc (found in oysters, beef, and pumpkin seeds).\n\nThen there are antioxidants that aren’t exactly considered essential nutrients, but still have effects on cells and tissues, Bradley Bolling, Ph.D., an assistant professor of food science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, tells SELF. You can find these in plant, animal, and other dietary sources.\n\nA few examples of these antioxidants include carotenoid cousins of beta carotene such as lycopene (found in watermelon, tomato sauce, and ketchup) and lutein and zeaxanthin (found in spinach, Romaine lettuce, and Swiss chard), chlorogenic acid (found in coffee, apples, and eggplants), flavonoids (found in berries, tea, and citrus fruits), and ergothioneine (found in mushrooms). Many of these non-essential antioxidants are being studied for their potential effects on optimizing health, preventing chronic disease, promoting longevity, and reducing inflammation, says Dr. Bolling. “There are varying grades of evidence for the effectiveness of these non-nutritive antioxidants,” he says.\n\n## How does eating antioxidants affect your body?\n\nAs a whole, antioxidants can be helpful because they fight back against the aforementioned issue of oxidative stress, which is linked to a wide swath of health problems. Cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and other metabolic diseases are just a few examples, says Dr. Garelnabi.\n\nOf course, a multitude of factors determine your risk of developing various diseases—oxidative stress being just one of them. Research does point to a broad range of health benefits in people who consume more antioxidants, but the National Institutes of Health notes that it’s possible the benefits of antioxidant-rich diets may have to do with a combination of substances in the food—or even other related lifestyle or dietary factors—rather than the antioxidants themselves.\n\n“Eating antioxidant-rich food is not only targeting one disease, but sometimes systemically helping the body to get a balance,” says Dr. Shen.\n\nLet’s take a look at the research showing a link between high antioxidant intake and reduced risk of disease. In one study published in the *European Journal of Nutrition*, researchers classified 23,595 Americans into four groups based on their antioxidant consumption. People who ate the most antioxidants had a 21% lower risk of dying over a 13-year period than people who ate the least, even as the researchers accounted for relevant mitigating factors such as participants’ age, sex, and economic status. (It’s worth noting, though, that this study was based on a 24-hour dietary recall, or people’s recollections of just one day of eating. Plus, as we mentioned above, the benefits may also have to do with other substances in the food, which can’t be measured here.) \n\nAccording to a meta-analysis published in *Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology* of 19 previously published studies that included over 700,000 people, a diet high in antioxidants may reduce the risk of cancer, with significant reductions seen with colorectal, endometrial, and gastric in particular. Research also indicates that high amounts of dietary antioxidants may influence your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and stroke.\n\nSo getting a good amount of antioxidants in your diet is generally considered to be good for your health. But because different antioxidants can have different effects within the body, it’s worth talking to your health care provider about your specific health history and risk factors, as well as the role that certain antioxidants may have on your health. For instance, higher intake of flavonoids has long been linked with a reduced risk of heart disease, and a recent study in the *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* suggests an association with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease too. If you’re concerned about a particular condition, talk to your health care provider about whether you should focus on eating more of any one particular thing—especially if you feel like your diet is unbalanced in any way.\n\nAll that said, dietary antioxidants are no substitute for medical treatment, and getting a balanced diet is always more beneficial than relying on any one nutrient. It’s worth noting that much of the research we’ve covered so far looked at total antioxidant intake, and what researchers found were correlations—not cause-and-effect relationships. While there’s plenty of research pointing to a link between higher antioxidant intake and lower risk of disease, we can’t say with certainty that loading up on any one antioxidant will change your health in specific ways. It’s about balance and variety, which we’ll explain in a bit.\n\n## How should you work antioxidants into your diet?\n\nFor the antioxidants that fall into the essential nutrient category, recommended daily allowances (RDAs) exist to help you plan your intake. For selenium, the RDA is 55 micrograms per day. For zinc and vitamins A, C, and E, you can find RDAs for your age and sex in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. (For instance, women 31–50 should shoot for 8 mg of zinc, 700 micrograms of vitamin A, 15 mg of vitamin E, and 75 mg of vitamin C.) Some of these essential nutrients, like vitamin C and vitamin A, are listed on food labels, so it’s easy to tally up how much you’re getting.\n\nThere\'s no standard recommended amount to consume for the antioxidants that aren’t essential nutrients; researchers are still determining them, says Dr. Bolling. You won’t see the dose of those antioxidants listed on the label of foods containing them, either.\n\nSo rather than trying to hit a specific amount of these, you can instead look to add more foods that contain antioxidants into your diet. “Just having berries for breakfast or eating citrus or drinking green tea is enough to put people into the higher level of patterns of consumption,” says Dr. Bolling.\n\nThe best way to enrich your diet with antioxidants is to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables (the U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend two and a half cups of vegetables and two cups of fruits per day), says Dr. Garelnabi. Nuts, whole grains, dark chocolate, and tea are also good antioxidant sources, as are lean meats and seafood, says Dr. Shen.\n\nDiversity is also important in your diet, since some antioxidants work better together, says Dr. Garelnabi. To make sure you’re getting a variety, try to include different colors on your plate, since the color of fruits and vegetables can serve as a clue to their antioxidant content, suggests a study published in *Current Research in Food Science**.* For example, reddish foods like apples, strawberries, sour cherries, red cabbage, and red peppers tend to be rich in a type of flavonoid called anthocyanins, while orange and yellow produce like mangos, yellow peppers, oranges, bananas, and nectarines are good sources of vitamin C.\n\nSo what about supplements? Loading up on antioxidants in the form of supplements doesn’t actually bring you any greater benefits. In fact, a 2014 review of the research stated “there is no evidence to support the use of antioxidant supplements in the primary prevention of chronic diseases or mortality.” In fact, there is some evidence that they may even be harmful, especially in high doses.\n\nEating a balanced diet for most people means you’re likely getting enough antioxidants and don’t need to take antioxidant supplements, says Dr. Garelnabi. However, some people *may* benefit from adding supplements, especially if they can’t tolerate or need to avoid certain foods. Just talk with your doctor before taking any supplements to determine whether you really need them and whether they could interact with any medications you take.\n\nOtherwise, if you’re focusing on a variety in your diet, and are making it a point to try new fruits or veggies to broaden what you’re taking in, you’re likely doing just fine on the antioxidant front. To really sharpen those benefits, though, you may want to pair your balanced plate with a workout routine: Exercise—as long as you aren’t overtraining—may even help boost your body’s production of natural antioxidants, says Dr. Garelnabi.\n\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:16:28', '2021-03-10 19:30:24', '/resources/images/food_fruits.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/what-are-antioxidants', 0, 0);

Lots of times, these are foods that play a big part in not only our families, but in our larger culture too.\n\n“Eating cultural foods can take us back to a comforting experience, which has a sentimental or nostalgic value,” Samina Kalloo, R.D.N., C.D.N, a registered dietitian based in New York, tells SELF. “Food has the power to connect us back to simpler times.”\n\nBut there’s a flip side benefit: Trying foods you may not be familiar with from *other* cultures can also be a really special way for you to respectfully learn about and experience them, which can give you a greater understanding of these cultures in more of a firsthand, active way. As another plus, trying different foods from other cultures can also help expand your palate, which is especially helpful if you’ve been in a food rut.\n\nDifferent cultures tend to use different ingredients—including fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices—and different preparation techniques, which bring unique bursts of flavor and texture to dishes that you may not be familiar with otherwise, explains Gina DeLuca, R.D., C.D.N., registered dietitian at Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone Hospital–Long Island.\n\nChances are pretty good that you have a few favorite cultural foods of your own, which you may turn to when you need a little pick-me-up. But if you want to broaden your tastes and try something new (or hear someone sing the praises of a food you already love), check out these 18 registered dietitians’ favorite dishes from their cultures.\n\n## 1. Horiatiki Salad\n\n“I grew up eating Greek food, and one thing I could eat every day is a Greek salad, also called a horiatiki salad. It contains simple, fresh ingredients that include tomato, sliced cucumber, green pepper, sliced red onion, Kalamata olives, and of course, feta cheese, and is dressed with extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper. When using high-quality olive oil with the remaining fresh ingredients, the flavors pop.\n\nI was introduced to it daily at the dinner table, particularly in the summertime when the ingredients were grown fresh from our garden. I eat it with fresh bread—sometimes pita bread—alongside my main entrée, which is usually lean poultry or fresh fish. Sometimes I eat it with just bread as my main course and it leaves me perfectly satisfied.” —Sarah Galanis, M.P.H., C.D.N., director of food and nutrition at NYU Langone Hospital–Brooklyn\n\n## 2. Eggplant Parmigiana\n\n“My favorite cultural food is—hands down—eggplant parmigiana, which is essentially a casserole of lightly breaded, fried eggplant slices layered with tomato marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese. It’s best if the eggplant is crisp, and the cheese cooked well-done or slightly burned. Toss in some fresh basil, and you’re set. The commingling of flavors is simply superb.\n\nMy mom would make it as a dish classic to our Italian culture. There’s a process of steps involved in it, for instance, ‘sweating’ the eggplant, which means slicing it into disks, lightly salting them, and placing them on and between paper towels to draw out the solanine—the ingredient that gives eggplant its initial bitter taste. It can be eaten for dinner, but leftovers reheat well for lunch, and I’ve also been known to eat leftovers for breakfast when there was nothing else I wanted. When I was pregnant with my son, my husband laughed at my open-mindedness to food possibilities—like eggplant parmigiana for breakfast.\n\nI adore that this dish can be modified in so many ways. You can make it classic style by frying the eggplant slices, but you can also grill or roast them to opt for a more heart-healthy option; you can change up your types of sauce or cheese; you can even use zucchini in place of eggplant if you have an eggplant allergy, or use dairy-free cheese and gluten-free bread crumbs if you have additional food allergies or intolerances. The possibilities are endless.” —DeLuca\n\n## 3. Goulash\n\n“I come from many cultures (English, Irish, Hungarian, but mostly Slovenian), so it was always fun watching my mom cook from very different cultures. My dad was not very adventurous, so looking back, we often had heartier Hungarian-type foods like goulash. The goulash my mom made was a saucy mix of beef, vegetables, and caraway seeds—she would often put them over buttered noodles. Sunday afternoons, my grandparents would come over and we would eat all together. My mom would often make this dish since everyone seemed to like it—and quite frankly, trying to cook for a crowd can be very expensive, and this was budget-friendly. My 98-year-old grandfather asked for it on his deathbed, so it was good enough to leave a lasting impression!\n\nI think it’s one of my favorite dishes because it does remind me of the dinners we had when I was little. Now when I make this dish, I often will substitute the beef for venison, just as a personal preference that doesn’t change the taste of it. Although you can often tweak a recipe to make it healthier, the base of the dish should remain the same and should be passed on to loved ones to keep the tradition going.” —Beth A. Czerwony, R.D., registered dietitian with Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition\n\n## 4. Sweet and Savory Sweet Potatoes\n\n“Sweet potatoes are a root vegetable that are prepared multiple ways in my African American culture. Sweet potatoes—specifically baked sweet potatoes—are sweet and savory, and I eat them as a side with my dinner. I simply bake them in the oven at 400°F for 30 to 40 minutes, and once done, I top with cinnamon, mash with a fork, and enjoy. Baking sweet potatoes in the oven gives them an amazing texture and brings out their sweet flavor.\n\nSweet potatoes come in many forms at holiday events: baked, whipped, in a pie, or topped with marshmallows. And you’re considered a top chef in my culture if you can make the best sweet potato pie or dish. It’s a badge of honor to prepare sweet potato dishes—only a few family members are trusted to bring sweet potato pie and candied yams or sweet potatoes to holiday gatherings. Also, a sweet potato recipe is passed down through generations. Each family has their own twist.” —Nijya Saffo, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.\n\n## 5. Arroz con Gandules\n\n“My ultimate favorite dish is arroz con gandules, a famous Puerto Rican Rice dish with a small type of legume. I have been eating this dish since I was a toddler—even now, everywhere we go, we are welcomed with a plate of arroz con gandules. It’s a staple for any gatherings, holiday celebrations, or special dinners.\n\nOur recipe starts with a sauce called sofrito and a package of sazón seasonings before adding the gandules. You can add green olives stuffed with pimento and several cilantro sprigs for more flavor, and I really like this rice dish with plenty of green olives. Regardless of the recipe, this arroz con gandules is usually served with tostones (fried green plantains) or maduritos (fried ripe plantains) and a leaf of lettuce with a couple tomato slices. My beverage of choice with this meal is typically a Malta (a non-alcoholic barley beverage). Latinx-Hispanic foods deliver not only in flavors and textures, but are also full of important nutrients such as fiber, healthy fats, and several vitamins and minerals.” —Sylvia E Klinger, M.S., R.D., C.P.T.\n\n## 6. Congee (Jook)\n\n“I love congee, also known as jook! It\'s a rice porridge that can be made simply with broth and rice, and jazzed up with all types of toppings—dried pork, boiled or tea egg, pickled vegetables, green onions, chili or sesame oil, or whatever you have in your pantry. Congee is one of those dishes that every Chinese grandmother makes if you\'re feeling under the weather—kind of akin to chicken soup in Western cultures. It\'s warm, comforting, and perfect on a rainy day. I crave it during the winter, when I just want something comforting and warm.\n\nI generally whip it up in my Instant Pot—I throw in a chicken carcass from my freezer, then add a cup of rice, about 8 cups of water, ginger, and minced shiitake mushrooms. My favorite toppings are not necessarily traditional, but I love adding sautéed shiitake mushrooms, a soft boiled egg, sesame oil and chili oil, and green onions.” —Leanna Tu, M.S., R.D.N.\n\n## 7. Stewed Okra and Black-Eyed Peas\n\n“I\'m not a big sweets person. I love savory, earthy, full-flavor foods, and these (along with the ‘trinity of greens,’ as they call it—turnips, mustard, and collard greens with apple cider vinegar) are some of my favorite side dishes for Sunday family meals. Growing up in the South, my family owned land and my dad grew several types of produce and raised livestock. I came to know and enjoy these as meal staples. You can eat them with dinner or lunch, and I\'ll even eat black-eyed peas with breakfast if I have grits and eggs. It just depends on how I feel.\n\nBlack-eyed peas are easy, and you can buy them in bulk. Soak them overnight, and cook them like my mom used to do it in the pressure cooker or Instant Pot. I usually get the frozen option and cook them on the stovetop. As for the greens, fresh tastes better than canned to me, and are lower in sodium. I like veggie broth, onions, garlic, peppers, and a little olive oil in mine with apple cider vinegar.” —YaQutullah Ibraheem Muhammad, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.\n\n## 8. Baingan Bharta\n\n“Being a melting pot of different cultures (Pakistani, Italian, and Polish) has always been the core to my identity. Growing up, I was exposed to a variety of delicious cultural cuisines, and my two favorites involve one of the most versatile vegetables—eggplant. While eggplant parmigiana, from my Italian side, is a close second, baingan bharta (roasted eggplant curry), from my Pakistani side, is my all-time favorite dish. Baingan bharta is made from roasted eggplant and seasoned with the most commonly used masalas and spices, such as coriander and cumin, along with tomatoes, onion, and garlic. It’s absolutely delicious.\n\nBaingan bharta was one of the main dishes at all of the family events I had with my Pakistani father’s side. I loved to eat it with roti (flatbread), because I could eat with my hands and no utensils! These days, I enjoy baingan bharta with rice and a seasoned cucumber-yogurt sauce, also known as raita. My husband is Trinidadian and this dish is also popular in his culture–so we enjoy it often together! For a while, I was intimidated to make my own eggplant curry, but since it’s truly a lifelong favorite, I figured it was time to start making it from scratch.” —Kalloo\n\n## 9. Tachin\n\n“I’m Persian American—my parents grew up in Iran and moved here when they were in their early 20s—and crispy rice is my favorite. Tachin is a layered rice dish that looks like a cake, and inside is layered with a saffron, yogurt, egg-rice mixture, and boiled chicken. The top of this ‘rice cake’ is pretty much all crispy rice, and it’s garnished with sautéed barberries, slivered almonds, and pistachios!\n\nI was raised with this meal, and we always had it as a staple at our table, especially at celebrations—it’s a vibrant addition, and it’s so full of flavor. I like to pair a piece of tachin with a side of a leafy green salad or shirazi salad (a Persian cucumber, tomato, and onion salad) or an optional side that is common in Persian food, such as shallots in plain yogurt or fresh bread with feta cheese, walnuts, and herbs. Since this is predominantly a rice dish, it can be paired with any main entrée. This meal doesn’t have to be made with chicken or red meat—it can be made vegetarian (lacto-ovo friendly, since it will still contain eggs and yogurt), and you can pair it with your choice of plant protein. I’d encourage everyone to try it, and I love encouraging clients and friends to try new meals, especially ones that contain lots of herbs and spices.” —Yasi Ansari, M.S., R.D.N., C.S.S.D.\n\n## 10. Pão de Queijo\n\n“My mother is from Brazil, so I grew up going to visit family in Brazil and speaking Portuguese. My favorite food from Brazil is pão de queijo, or cheese bread, which I was introduced to as a young child in Brazil. Pão de queijo is soft, chewy, and has a delicious mild, cheesy flavor with a light, crusty outside and a soft inside.\n\nPão de queijo is versatile and can be eaten with any meal, or a snack just as is from the oven. It can also be sliced and eaten with jam, as a sandwich with filling, or as part of a delicious breakfast with a steaming cup of coffee. Since it’s made with tapioca flour, pão de queijo is also gluten-free. I always have tapioca flour in the pantry, or frozen pão de queijo that can be quickly baked for a delicious treat.” —Sonya Angelone, M.S., R.D.N.\n\n## 11. Muboora Une Dovi\n\n“I am a Shona girl from Zimbabwe, and my favorite cultural dish is muboora une dovi: pumpkin leaves (whose flavor is somewhat akin to a very light spinach) smothered in a creamy peanut butter sauce. Sometimes, hot peri peri peppers are added to give the dish some heat.\n\nPeanuts and peanut butter play an important role in Zimbabwean food culture; we add them to everything, from breakfast porridge to rice, meat, and vegetables. Peanuts and peanut butter are important for boosting both the nutritional value and taste of food. And pumpkin leaves are simply a Zimbabwean staple. My mother grew them in her garden, and when in season, we ate them often. Pumpkin leaves are typically not sold in United States supermarkets, but I have been lucky enough to find them in independent international shops and local farmers’ markets. If you grow your own pumpkins, pick the young, tender leaves, which are easier to prepare and have a smoother mouthfeel. (Here\'s a recipe with instructions on preparing the pumpkin leaves.) There’s a big nostalgia factor with this meal: I am an immigrant, and muboora une dovi is a dish that is loaded with memories of home, as it transports me to my mother\'s garden and kitchen.” —Cordialis Msora-Kasago, M.A., R.D.\n\n## 12. Rajma-Chawal\n\n“One of my all-time favorite Indian dishes is rajma-chawal: kidney beans (rajma) simmered in a delicious onion and tomato spice-infused sauce served with white rice (chawal). It’s almost like a vegetarian chili.\n\nMy school cafeteria in Madras, India, had delicious vegetarian food choices for lunch, though I typically took a homemade lunch every day. One day, I had forgotten it, and had to buy it at school. I tasted rajma and rice for my first time—it was so tasty and satisfying. I rushed home and told my mom all about it. My mom was not familiar with it since she was from a different state, but she was able to recreate it at home for us, and it became part of our family meal rotations. Now I continue to enjoy making it for my family. For a classic pairing, enjoy rajma with some plain rice or roti. I serve it to our family and friends all the time, and I have a simple recipe for this dish in my book *My Indian Table: Quick & Tasty Vegetarian Recipes**.”* —Vandana Sheth, R.D.N., C.D.E.\n\n## 13. Borscht\n\n“I am half Russian on my mom’s side and she makes a delicious dish called borscht, which is a beetroot soup that can take about half a day to make. It’s packed with delicious veggies like beets, cabbage, carrots, onion, parsnip, leeks and potatoes, and cooked in a flavorful beef stock. My grandma from Russia passed down the recipe to my mom, who would make it in the winter months at home while growing up in California. (You typically eat borscht in the colder winter months.)\n\nI enjoy it with a dollop of sour cream and a dark bread like pumpernickel. The rich flavor of the bread complements the heartiness of the soup. Cooking borscht makes the entire house smell amazing since it sits simmering on the stovetop most of the day. The scent evokes memories of my grandma and now my mom, enjoying meals at home together. It has a wonderful meld of flavors and is fairly customizable to meet your dietary needs. ” —Mia Syn, M.S., R.D.N.\n\n## 14. Dim Sum\n\n“A specialty of Cantonese cuisine is dim sum, which is a general reference to small foods that can be savory or sweet, and are always consumed with tea. Imagine small plates of dumplings, rice noodles, and buns—it\'s like Chinese dishes served tapas style and sipping tea for brunch!\n\nGrowing up, I remember going for dim sum with my parents and my siblings. It was a central component to family celebrations, whenever we had visitors and Chinese holidays. Often, there\'s no menu when you eat dim sum. Servers come around with a rolling cart loaded with a variety of dishes all meant to be shared by the entire table. There\'s no limit to how many dishes you *should* pick, and you’re encouraged to eat as the dishes hit the table.\n\nReflecting on my past dim sum brings about nostalgia, and when enjoying it in the present, it brings forth connection to those at the table, Chinese history, and tradition. I\'ve worked with several clients who are seeking connection to their Chinese heritage. Food is just one of the most powerful ways to foster this *and* a sense of belonging. Dim sum is a great opportunity to explore that!” —Laura Iu, R.D., C.D.N., R.Y.T.\n\n## 15. Jamaican Chicken Curry\n\n“One of my favorite foods growing up was my dad\'s chicken curry. He\'s Jamaican, and he cooked it on special occasions. It\'s a stew dish with strong flavors of curry and turmeric, as well as potatoes and carrots, which make it super hearty. It\'s a really savory dish with a ton of flavor and spice. He used to make it with rice and peas, another Jamaican staple.\n\nI think I used to love it so much because it was made on special occasions, and it\'s a dish that sounds easier to make than it is. It was also made with love, which I think really helps. You can always alter the spice level to your liking. For those not used to the flavors, it might be an acquired taste, but it’s definitely worth it. My dad also never made the dish the same way twice. Sometimes he would add more peppers or even put spinach in the dish.” —Shana Minei Spence, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N.\n\n## 16. Salsa Molcajeteada\n\n“One dish that I must have every time I am in Mexico is my mom’s salsa molcajeteada, a traditional salsa made with grilled jalapeños, onions, and tomato, along with lime juice, cumin, salt, and pepper. One important thing about preparing the salsa is that it is made in a molcajete (a bowl-like mortar traditionally carved in natural volcanic stone). Making it in a molcajete adds flavor and presentation. The flavor that it gets is hard to describe but distinguishes it from other salsas.\n\nIn my family, it is the perfect companion to carne asada (grilled steak) and homemade corn tortillas. I love the simplicity of all the ingredients, the fresh flavors, the spiciness, and the added layer of flavor that brings to the carne asada. Because the ingredients are grilled, usually we eat it fresh the day we grilled, but make extra to add to meals later the next day. It tastes like home and family.” —Su-Nui Escobar, R.D.N.\n\n## 17. Egg Tarts\n\n“The Hong Kong–style egg tarts were one of my favorite desserts-pastries growing up. Whenever I traveled to see my grandparents overseas in China every summer, we’d visit bakeries where they made them fresh every day. It’s essentially a flaky, pie-like pastry cup filled with sweet egg custard. I love that it’s mini-sized and just the right amount of sweet—like a mini pie! It’s warm and crispy on the outside, but when you bite into them, they’re soft and sweet on the inside. My mom has also made these from scratch before, and I love a great homemade egg tart.\n\nIt’s more of a dessert for me, but it’s commonly served in restaurants that serve dim sum. You can eat it warm or cold, but I love it freshly baked, right out of the oven! A shared dish like this can create so many memories. Food is so much more than just nourishment for our bodies. Culturally, it serves to bring people together.” —May Zhu, M.B.A., R.D.N., L.D.N.\n\n## 18. Collard Greens and Cornbread\n\n“I love collard greens and cornbread. While you *can* have greens without cornbread, it feels incomplete to me. In my family, the greens are slowly simmered with meat, creating a savory broth and tender greens. Then you add a capful of vinegar to your greens and eat them right with the cornbread.\n\nI’ve been eating greens for as long as I can remember, starting as a kid. Growing up in the South, we had access to plenty of inexpensive vegetables grown on farms or in a neighbor\'s backyard. So it\'s typical to see huge heads of collard greens hanging out in the kitchen just waiting to be cleaned at any given moment. And the process of getting, cleaning, cutting, and cooking the greens is all a part of the experience.\n\nGreens are special to me because it reminds me of how I sat and watched my grandma make them. It’s the dish that everyone in my family eats. They take time, but the effort is well worth it. And you can bet there won\'t be any left at the end of the day. Now, as an adult who happens to be a registered dietitian nutritionist, I love that I grew up eating such nutritious food and I didn\'t even know it.” —Marisa Moore, M.B.A., R.D.N., L.D.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:17:03', '2021-03-10 19:30:54', '/resources/images/GettyImages-1301473267.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/favorite-cultural-foods', 0, 0);

Food Stying by Drew Aichele. Prop Styling by Campbell Pearson.\r\n\r\n***Welcome to******Grocery Diaries******, a new series that illustrates just how varied and personalized “healthy eating” really is.** So many factors impact the choices we make at the grocery store, including access and affordability, health conditions, our individual cultural backgrounds, even what simply makes us (and our taste buds) happy. So we asked people across the country to share their grocery lists with us, and then called up a few of them to ask for more details. Why do they buy what they buy? How much do they spend? Who are they shopping for? What health conditions or nutritional concerns are they thinking about when they choose, for instance, almond milk over cow’s milk, or particular flavors or spices or treats? In this Grocery Diaries installment, we hear from an avid baker who has prediabetes and eats dessert every night.*\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n**Name:** Lissette Gomez\r\n**Age:** 50\r\n**Occupation:** Project manager\r\n**Location:** Monterey Park, California\r\n**Race/Gender:** Latina woman\r\n**Health conditions/dietary restrictions to consider:** Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), prediabetes, and a family history of diabetes\r\n**Grocery shopping frequency:** Shops for two people four times a month\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nLissette Gomez always saves room for a glass of milk, ahome-baked dessert, and two squares of dark chocolate after dinner. “I like to end my night with that stronger chocolate flavor, and the milk is very soothing. I feel like it relaxes me so I can go to bed peacefully,” she tells SELF.\r\n\r\nLissette bakes a new dessert every Sunday. Oftentimes, she makes a fruit-based loaf because it reminds her of eating sweet bread in El Salvador, where she was born. “I bake so much because El Salvador grows coffee, so the local tradition is to drink coffee with sweet bread. I kept the sweet bread but added the milk component,” she says. Lissette has prediabetes, a family history oftype 2 diabetes, and experiences low blood sugar (a condition called hypoglycemia) when she doesn’t eat for several hours. She does her best to include protein and fiber in every meal—including dessert—to stabilize her blood sugar, based on her doctor’s recommendation. To help accomplish this, she limits carbohydrates and uses nutrient-dense ingredients in many of her recipes. For example, Lissette substitutes bananas for some of the sugar in her muffin and bread recipes to increase the fiber content.\r\n\r\nPrediabetes happens when your blood sugar is higher than the typical range, but not high enough to be considered diabetes, according to theU.S. National Library of Medicine. And while anyone can experience a blood sugar dip after not eating for some time, people with prediabetes can be especially predisposed to that kind of fluctuation, which is why Lissette eats a daily snack to ensure that doesn’t happen. In addition to managing her prediabetes, Lissette also makes an effort to eat in a way that will help her avoid developing diabetes. There are two types of diabetes, but they can both lead to consistently high blood sugar above that prediabetes threshold, according to theMayo Clinic. With type 2 diabetes (the kind that runs in Lissette\'s family), your body doesn’t efficiently use insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar. When that happens, your body can’t produce enough insulin to make up for this inefficiency, leading to extra sugar in your blood. Along with lifestyle changes like being physically active, eating a nutrient-rich diet and being mindful of carbohydrate intake can help prevent prediabetes from progressing into diabetes. (It\'s even possible for some people toreverse prediabetes with these kinds of changes.)\r\nWith all of this in mind, Lissette shops for a variety of foods that suits her tastes and dietary needs. Here are 10 items she picks up in a typical grocery trip.\r\n\r\n1.Lindt Excellence 85% Cocoa Dark Chocolate: $2.99\r\n\r\n“I’ve tried other brands, but Lindt is so silky and good,” Lissette says. “It melts in your mouth. I haven’t been able to find anything else that’s comparable.” Lissette never liked milk chocolate and previously ateunsweetened baking chocolate before finding this bar.\r\n\r\n2. Plantains: $.50\r\n\r\nOne of Lissette’sfavorite breakfasts is a plate of plantains, beans, and Greek yogurt because she loves the combination of flavors. “The beans are salty and the plantains are really sweet. I love that salty-sweet combination,” she says. Sometimes, she makes a modified version of canoas de platanos maduros, or ground beef-stuffed plantains, a popular dish in El Salvador. “I cook the ground beef and eat plantains on the side like you would a potato,” she says.\r\n\r\n3.Guerrero White Corn Tortillas: $1.79\r\n\r\n“We cannot have a meal without tortillas. You’re going to laugh, but we even eat tortillas with spaghetti in my family,” Lissette says. She eats two tortillas a day to still enjoy a food she loves while reducing her carbohydrate intake. She typically uses them fortacos, quesadillas, or a quick breakfast wrap. “Cheese and avocado in a tortilla is a lifesaver. You cook it for 30 seconds in the microwave, and you’re ready to go,” she says.\r\n\r\n4.Simple Truth Flaxseed Meal Whole Ground: $3.79\r\n\r\nNearly 15 years ago after she was diagnosed withhigh cholesterol, Lissette started drinking one tablespoon of ground flax mixed with water every morning. “I remember my mom telling me that if you drink flax it helps with high cholesterol, and I’ve been doing it ever since,” she says. Turns out, Lissette’s mother was right. Flax is a great source of soluble fiber and may help lower cholesterol and keep blood sugar stable, according to theMayo Clinic. Although she no longer has high cholesterol, Lissette continues the habit and even adds flax in her baked goods.\r\n\r\n5.Organic Valley Grassmilk Organic Whole Milk: $5.99\r\n\r\n“I really love milk—I love anything dairy,” Lissette says. After dinner, she drinks plain whole milk or makes it into hot chocolate toaccompany dessert. She likes whole milk best because it’s more satisfying than reduced-fat versions. As Lissette explains, “It’s so creamy and rich. I’ll have milk with my coffee, and I don’t really want the coffee. I just want the milk!”\r\n\r\n6. Bananas: $.27\r\n\r\n“I use bananas a lot in my baking and to make smoothies,” Lissette says. “I don’t particularly like supersweet foods, and I also get nutrients from the banana.” Usually, Lissette substitutes bananas for a portion of white cane sugar in her recipes. (Depending on the size, one banana has nearly three grams of fiber and one gram of protein, plus calcium and potassium, according to theU.S. Food and Drug Administration. In comparison, cane sugar doesn’t contain any fiber, protein, or minerals.) Bananas are the star ingredient in hernutrient-dense take on Cocoa Pebbles. “I love Cocoa Pebbles. My version is made with oatmeal, milk, banana, and some cocoa powder. I cook it all together until the mixture is really creamy,” she says.\r\n\r\n7.Two Good Plain Greek Yogurt: $1.50\r\n\r\n“I put this on everything. You name it, and I’ll put Greek yogurt on it. I add a tablespoon on something, and it gives me the creaminess that I crave,” Lissette explains. She stirs Greek yogurt into heroatmeal and pasta, adds a dollop on top of quesadillas, or mixes it in her smoothies. One of her favorite snacks is a mango, coconut water, and Greek yogurt smoothie.\r\n\r\n8. Dinosaur Kale: $1.99\r\n\r\nLissette uses kale for just one purpose: making omelets. “I used to make a spinach omelet, but spinach doesn’t taste like anything. The kale is crunchier. It’s meatier. I like it a lot,” she says. She starts her day with a substantial breakfast like kale omelets becausethe protein and fiber are satisfying and keep her blood sugar stable.\r\n\r\n9.Vital Farms Pasture-Raised Eggs Large: $6.49\r\n\r\nAlthough Lissette eats omeletsin the morning because they’re a great source of protein, she believes eggs are best served at night. “I actually prefer eggs for dinner than for breakfast. They are a quick protein and so good,” Lissette explains. She uses eggs to make salads, fried rice, and huevos rancheros, a dish made with tortilla, eggs, and tomato sauce. According to Lissette, Vital Farms sells the most stunning eggs she’s ever seen. “The yolks are almost orange, it’s just so beautiful.” \r\n\r\n10. Avocado: $1.25\r\n\r\nIt seems like almost everyoneloves avocado these days—but not Lissette. “It’s not that I dislike avocado, but if avocados went out of season forever, then I would be okay,” she says. So why does she eat them? Because they’re a good source of monounsaturated fat, which can help keep her cholesterol low. She generally eats avocado in salads and says the fruit is a good substitute for mayonnaise. “The avocado makes tuna salad really creamy. It really works—I was surprised by how good it is.” \r\n\r\n*All products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

These kitchen workhorses are a multi-tasker’s dream, helping you to chop, blitz, blend, and yes—even knead dough—with speed and precision. At their most basic, a food processor is simply a gadget that supports the basic tasks we undertake in the kitchen. \n\nHaving a tool that makes cooking and prepping easier can make a big difference in how we feel about the time we spend in the kitchen. In fact, when you’re feeling sick of cooking, the practice of meal prepping with the help of a food processor is something nutritionist Wendy Lopez, R.D., highlights as one of the ways you can truly support yourself. \n\nOn the flip side, the food processor can help you maintain the rituals that ground you. Cookbook author Elizabeth Barbone, the founder of Cook Fast Eat Well, is big on making pizza dough in her food processor. “Friday night pizza is a sacred tradition in our house,” she tells SELF. “A food processor quickly develops gluten, making for a chewy and light dough.”\n\nFrom pizza dough to meal prep, choosing the best food processor involves thinking through the ways in which you want to use it. Are you looking to replace your blender with a supercharged do-it-all model? Or do you just need something small that you can keep stashed on the counter for quickly chopping onions? There are options to fit every need. To help us round up some of the best food processors to share with you, we’ve asked a few of our favorite food pros to share their thoughts, along with any tips and tricks that make using one even more helpful.\n\nAll products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

And this hefty 14-cup model provides it. It does the basics of chopping, slicing, shredding, and even kneading—and that’s just with the standard attachments. If you want to spiralize or get a perfect dice, there’s an attachment for that. Despite all its capabilities, you might be surprised that there\'s no digital interface—just two buttons: one for pulsing and one for continuous processing. And truly that’s all you need, no matter what you’re preparing. For Barbone, her food processor needs to do it all. “It can handle mincing a single garlic clove *and* churn easily through pizza dough.”If the 14-cup size seems extravagant, keep in mind that this tool is meant to help you out in the kitchen for years to come—well beyond the three-year warranty—so this size means you can make pizza dough in it whenever you decide to, even if you’ve only ever used it to make pestos and sauces up until then.Nutrition and business coach Ashely Pardo grew up watching her grandmother use this very Cuisinart food processor in the kitchen (she even inherited her first one from her!) and reaches for it whenever she’s making sauces, dips, or purées. “The food processor creates just a bit more texture than a high-speed blender (like a Vitamix), and it\'s perfect for hummus, pesto, tzatziki, chimichurri.” $219 AT WALMART\n\n\n![img](https://media.self.com/photos/60369f4061906e338dd0c905/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/kitchenaid.png)\n\n\n\nAmazon2The Small and Simple Option: KitchenAid Cordless 5-Cup ChopperRegardless of the size or brand of any food processor, how well it can actually process food is something to pay attention to. “Before buying a food processor, check out the strength of the motor,” says Barbone. “You want a food processor that can handle mixing dough and grinding foods into a nice smooth purée.” While mixing up doughs isn’t something you can do in this 5-cup chopper from Kitchenaid, that might not matter much if what you’re looking for is something that can help you chop, blend, whip, and purée. This chopper does all that without needing to be plugged in since it’s powered by a rechargeable lithium ion battery that lasts through the chopping of 40 onions. For apartment dwellers with small kitchens and not a lot of counter or cabinet space, this offers innovation in size, function (the cordless life is a game changer), and storage. For example, all the accessories for this model get stashed inside the bowl attachment when it’s not in use. Talk about smart design\n\n![img](https://media.self.com/photos/6036b19061906e338dd0c91f/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/breville.png)\n\n\n\nSur La Table3The Sleek, Quiet Option: Breville Sous-Chef 12-Cup Food ProcessorIf you’re looking for a workhouse food processor that can do it all, and one that’s still sleek enough to keep out on the countertop, this number from Breville is the one. It does everything a good food processor is meant to do—chop, slice, purée, and knead—but very quietly. It’s a favorite of chef Nyesha Arrington who says that this one makes it easier to \"prep ingredients in advance so when it’s time to cook you have the energy to be as creative you want.” Speaking of getting creative, one of Arrington’s favorite attachments for the Breville Sous Chef is the French Fry Disk. “It’ll turn any veggie into a French fry,” she says.

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (53, 11, 'Review: Territory Foods Is One of the Best Meal Kits for People With Special Dietary Needs', 'Nutritious, chef-made meals for every kind of eater.', '![SELF Certified](/resources/images/self-sertified.a8219d3a493929b6ab03987fa72e70cae329bf88.svg)\r\n\r\n![Territory Foods Review 2020 One of the Best Vegan Meal Delivery Services ](/resources/images/celebrity_chefs_feature%402x.jpg)\r\n\r\nCourtesy of brand\r\n\r\nPros\r\n\r\n- No work involved\r\n- Caters to wide variety of dietary needs\r\n- Seamless customization process\r\n- Focus on nutrient-rich and more sustainably sourced food\r\n\r\nCons\r\n\r\n- Relatively expensive\r\n- Only available in a few areas\r\n\r\nAbout a year into the pandemic, I’ve cracked open what feels like 12,000 cans of beans and boxes of pasta. So when the opportunity to review ameal delivery service presented itself, I was psyched. A meal kit that requires no cooking whatsoever? Sign me up.\r\n\r\nI was attracted to Territory Foods for a few reasons (in addition to the welcome break from cooking). The company advertises that its food is made by a team of independent chefs who create meals in their own commercial kitchens and restaurants, as opposed to a central hub owned by the meal company located in another city, which is how many meal kit services operate. \r\n\r\nTerritory’semphasis on high-quality ingredients also caught my eye. It largely relies on ingredients that are highly nutritious (whole foods rich in essential nutrients, like veggies, whole grains, or fish) and more sustainably sourced when possible. For example, it uses mostly cage-free eggs, hormone-free meat, wild-caught or sustainably farm-raised fish, and organic and/or local produce when possible.\r\n\r\nI’ve got a couple of relevant dietary preferences (something Territory caters extremely well to): I’m not a strictvegan, but I do avoid animal products where I can—anytime I’m shopping and cooking for myself or ordering food at a place that has vegan options. I also havetype 1 diabetes, meaning my body doesn’t make insulin (the hormone that moves carbs out of the bloodstream and into your cells for energy storage). So I give myself insulin at mealtimes via my insulin pump. While *technically* I can eat however many carbs I want as long as I match them with enough insulin, I generally try to stick to under 50–60 grams per meal to avoid blood sugar spikes—and include a good amount of fiber, protein, and fat (like many people generally looking for nutritionally balanced meals).\r\n\r\nAnother part of their business model I appreciated: A company initiative calledTerritoryServes lets you purchase and donate meals to frontline workers, mainly in health care. For every two meals you give, it donates a third.\r\n\r\nI evaluated my experience with Territory Foods based on ourmeal delivery kit buying guide. Here’s how it went.\r\n\r\n**Customization**\r\n\r\nTerritory’s level of customization and meal selection process are excellent. There are about 45 items to choose from weekly, the majority being lunch and dinner. There are also a handful of breakfasts and à la carte family-style meal components, including family style veggie sides (likemashed potatoes), and protein mains (likesun-dried-tomato seared salmon), generally offering about three or four servings. There are also a couple of baked goods (likepaleo fudge brownies) and cold brew coffee.\r\n\r\nIf having that many choices sounds overwhelming, fear not—you can quickly whittle down your options with a number of precise, easy-to-set filters:\r\n\r\n- **Diet:** Territory offers 10 (!) different diet filters—including vegan, vegetarian, and Mediterranean, as well as trendy weight-loss diets likepaleo,keto, andWhole30—though you can also decline to select a preference.\r\n- **Ingredients you’d like to avoid:** There are dozens of options—cilantro, tree nuts, shellfish, vegan cheese, mushrooms, legumes, soy—which allows you to get pretty specific, and is great for picky eaters and people with food allergies or sensitivities.\r\n- **Taste:** A simpletaste quiz will influence which meals are more highly recommended to you. You can also select meals from a particular chef whose food you enjoy.\r\n- **Meal style:** You can look for breakfast, lunch/dinner, and/or à la carte.\r\n- **Nutritional profile:** You can opt to only see meals within an exact macronutrient range (for instance, meals between 30 and 60 grams of carbs with at least 20 grams of protein and 15 grams of fat). You can also sort meals from low to high by the amount of carbs or protein they contain. Another helpful feature is that the meal gallery page displays key nutrition facts (calories, carbs, protein, fat) for each meal without the need to click through to each individual page. This made it easy for me to steer clear of low-calorie or extra high-carb meals.\r\n\r\nBased on the settings you choose, Territory will suggest a menu, which is extremely easy to edit to your liking. While I played around with different filters to see how they worked, the only filter I actually used was the vegan one. The meals I ended up with were:\r\n\r\n-Berbere Split Peas with Brown Rice and Veggie Medley\r\n-Mediterranean Tofu with Rosemary Vegetables and Basmati Rice\r\n-Tofu Fajitas with Cauliflower Rice and Ranchero Sauce\r\n-Vegan Eggplant Lasagna with Broccoli Almondine\r\n-Vegetable Pot Pie Stew with Olive Oil Mashed Potatoes\r\n-North African–Style Chickpeas with Apricot Glazed Carrots and Minted Quinoa\r\n-Red Coconut Curry Tofu with Veggies\r\n-Vegan RightRice Spanish-Style Paella with Mushrooms\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, I browsed some of the non-vegan options, too, and they sounded just as tasty (and veggie packed!) as my picks—like pistachio-crusted tuna cakes with fennel apple slaw or Greek chicken bowl with lemon tarragon rice.\r\n\r\nThe only place I ran into limited selection issues was breakfast, but this was actually not a huge disappointment for me, since I generally like to stick with the basics.\r\n\r\n**Affordability**\r\n\r\nI’ll go ahead and say it: These meals are not cheap. The standard sized options, said to be “the ‘just right’ helping for most folks”—I found this to be true—start at $13.95 each. All of my meals cost that much, but many of the meat and fish options were pricier, anywhere from $15.50 to $18.95. You can also downsize and order the smaller “boost” size of a meal for $10.95, meant for “lighter eaters and grazers.” (Not I.)\r\n\r\nThe more you order, the more you save. You can pick a 10- or 18-meal plan (which gets you one free), or choose a recurring order (which saves you 5% on your weekly order).\r\n\r\nWorking with $13.95 per meal, that puts them at the top of the rough price range for aHomeChef meal-sized serving, for instance. The higher price point is in line with the pricier organic and more sustainably sourced ingredients, and the fact that all the work is done for you. Plus, the variety comes at a premium—no big batches, repeat meals, or getting bored.\r\n\r\nWhile Territory isn’t the most inexpensive meal kit option, it’s a decent deal compared to takeout (which runs about $20 to $25 for me on average, including taxes, delivery fees, and tip). I can get more mileage out of takeout, though, since I can usually count on having leftovers.\r\n\r\n**Order and Delivery Process**\r\n\r\nYou can order however few or many items you like a week through Territory’s custom plan or go with a pre-set 10-meal or 18-meal plan. The options to skip a delivery week or pause your subscription altogether are very easy to find. And you can choose to have meals delivered on Sunday, Wednesday, or both. (Different meals are available on different days.) Currently, the company delivers to major cities like my home base of New York City, the D.C. metro area, the Bay Area, and Houston.\r\n\r\nI opted for a custom plan of eight meals spread across both delivery days, so that my meals would be sitting in the fridge for less time. Both deliveries went off without a hitch, and I got an email notifying me when the food was out for delivery and when it had arrived, which was nice. The food was delivered in recyclable containers, compostable paper trays and plastic lids, and packed with gel ice packs to keep it plenty cold. One of the containers had a little bit of liquid spilling out, but that’s common enough with delivery that I wasn’t too bothered.\r\n\r\n**Ease of Use**\r\n\r\nAh, the simplest thing about Territory Foods. People who prefer to cook and those who like to sing for their supper, look elsewhere—it took about two minutes to “prep” my food.\r\n\r\nAll of the meals came labeled with simple heating instructions for the microwave and stove top—basically, heating for one or two minutes, stirring once or twice. I experimented with a few different methods: microwaving the food right in the container and then eating out of the container or plating; plating and then microwaving; and cooking in a sauce pan and then plating. I didn’t notice any difference in the taste or texture based on the cooking method I used. The meals also come with a “best enjoyed by” date based on how well the ingredients hold up. (All are good for three days after the delivery date—after that, you can freeze them.)\r\n\r\n**Nutrition Profile**\r\n\r\nA big marketing point for Territory Foods is that it’s all free of gluten and dairy—which is great for people with celiac disease, a wheat allergy, or lactose intolerance—as well as refined sugar. These ingredients are not something most other people need to avoid (andrefined sugar is not evil!), but could be a plus if you’re steering clear for any reason.\r\n\r\nThe company *does* note that the food is made in kitchens where gluten, dairy, and other allergens may be present, though—which might be a cause for concern for someone with severe celiac disease or a severe nut allergy, for instance.\r\n\r\nThe most common ingredients in the vegan meals I ordered were veggies (a nice wide variety, from leafy to root), whole grains, beans and legumes, and plant-based proteins (namely, tofu), plus some nuts and nut-based vegan cheeses.\r\n\r\nI found my meals to be pretty well-balanced and satiating, with a nice mix of carbs, protein, and fat. Standard sized meals range, on average, between about 450 and 600 calories, while the lighter meals and snacks run between 250 to 450 calories. I noticed there was some variability, though, especially among the non-vegan options—for instance, the keto tuna cakes with pistachio crust, coleslaw, and pesto sauce were 739 calories, while standard-size meals were closer to 300. A big difference in caloric bang for your buck! But, then again, Territory is all about catering to your dietary needs, and since you can easily select for minimum calorie count and more, that shouldn’t be a problem.\r\n\r\n**Taste**\r\n\r\nFor the most part, my meals were pretty tasty and satisfying. Just about everything was well-seasoned, adequately spiced, and nothing was overcooked—no mushy, undersalted veggies here—but I wouldn\'t have minded a bit more oomph in a couple of dishes since I tend to double the spices and herbs a recipe calls for.\r\n\r\nIt was awesome to find dishes from a variety of cuisines too—there was always something to suit my mood sitting in the fridge. And I definitely appreciated the mix of “obviously vegan” meals (like tofu-based dishes) and “accidentally vegan” meals (like grain and bean-based dishes).\r\n\r\nThe only miss was the Mediterranean tofu with veggies and rice dish, which was oversalted, missing most of the collard greens that were promised, and contained a couple of unpleasantly tough, gristly bits of tofu.\r\n\r\n**The Bottom Line**\r\n\r\nI don’t think I realized quite how much I needed (okay, wanted) a break from cooking until my first Territory boxful of ready-made meals came. I’ve ordered takeout pretty rarely since the pandemic started—really only on special occasions, like seeing a friend or at the end of a particularly rough week. I genuinely enjoy cooking for myself most of the time, but sometimes I do get tired of it. I honestly forgot how delightful it is to *not* cook everything you eat.\r\n\r\nOverall, Territory Foods offers some of the best qualities of takeout—namely, convenience and variety—while avoiding some of its downsides too. For one, the sometimes genuinely overwhelming number of options in New York. (I know, a ridiculous thing to complain about! But when I’m borderline hangry and the decision paralysis hits, it’s an issue.) Territory also removed the sometimes long and unpredictable delivery time; the cost of fees, tax, and tips; and the lack of nutrition facts. The food was also tasty, very aligned to my dietary needs, and reasonably filling. All in all, if you’re looking for a well-rounded, nutrition-packed takeout alternative, Territory Foods is a very solid choice.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:20:21', '2021-03-10 19:35:51', '/resources/images/celebrity_chefs_feature@2x.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/review/territory-foods-meal-kit', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (54, 11, 'What Is a Heart-Healthy Diet, and What Does It Mean to Eat for Heart Health?', 'It doesn’t need to be complicated.', '![What Is HeartHealthy Diet These 7 Simple Eating Tips Can Protect Your Heart](https://media.self.com/photos/6014440741347be6b3a5adfe/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/veggies_healthy_eating.jpeg)Criene Images/Adobe Stock\n\nEating “healthy” can be confusing, so it’s pretty common to wonder what a heart- healthy diet really is. But it’s a really important topic to explore. Heart disease kills more Americans than any other cause, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And what you eat can actually play a big part in it: In one 2017 study published in *JAMA*, researchers estimated that certain eating habits (like consistently having a lot of sodium or not enough veggies) may contribute to about 45% of deaths from cardiometabolic diseases, which include heart disease, strokes, and type 2 diabetes.\n\nTo understand why what you eat is so important, it can be helpful to take a closer look at the function of your all-important ticker. Your heart is the epicenter of your body, pumping oxygen-rich blood through your arteries to the rest of you. When arteries narrow or clog, a condition known as coronary heart disease, they cut off blood to your heart, jeopardizing the entire organ.\n\nYour main goal is to keep your blood vessels pliable and unobstructed, so blood can continue to flow freely. And what you eat plays a part in determining the amount of build-up or clarity in those vessels. There’s a lot to unpack with the connection between eating and your heart health, though. Here’s what you need to know.\n\n## 1. A heart-healthy diet doesn’t have to be a really restrictive *diet.*\n\nWhen you picture a heart-healthy diet, you may think of a big bowl of plain oatmeal or a life without butter. The truth is that eating for heart health isn’t about focusing on one (or a few) foods, or avoiding some completely. It’s more about eating foods that are beneficial in multiple ways and establishing patterns you can stick with to protect your heart over time.\n\n“Consistency is really the most important thing rather than doing something that’s very restrictive,” Kurt M. Hong, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of clinical medicine and executive director of the Center for Clinical Nutrition at USC, tells SELF.\n\nConsider your diet part of a preventive approach to avoiding coronary heart disease, as well as to lowering risk factors of it like high blood pressure and high cholesterol—which can contribute to early heart attacks and strokes, Dr. Hong says. For best results, combine your eating plan with exercise, which keeps blood vessels pliable and helps to reduce inflammation. “People who exercise regularly tend to do much, much better in terms of heart health,” says Dr. Hong.\n\nYou may have already heard of some eating plans for heart health, including the Mediterranean Diet (rich in whole grains, nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, and of course, olive oil) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH, eating plan (high in whole grains and fruits and vegetables rich in potassium). While these are evidence-backed plans for a heart-healthy diet, the idea of following a “diet” may not be the most appealing for the long term. Instead, you can take some of their tactics—along with some other research-backed components—and use them to create a more general guide for how you can eat to best promote your heart health.\n\n## 2. You don’t need to avoid all fat.\n\nKeeping your heart healthy doesn’t mean automatically cutting out fat. “Fat is an important macronutrient that should be present in our diet,” Rafaela G. Feresin, Ph.D., an assistant professor of nutrition at Georgia State University, tells SELF. Your body uses fat for energy, nutrient absorption, and organ protection.\n\nInstead, think about emphasizing certain sources of fats over others.\n\nYou should consider reducing consumption of saturated fat (mainly found in meat, pork, poultry, and dairy products) and trans fat (which occurs naturally in meat and dairy products and is artificially formed in fried and baked goods), says Dr. Feresin.\n\nWhen you eat too much of these fats, you can increase the production of cholesterol and activate inflammatory cells that can help that cholesterol nestle into your arteries, potentially leading to blockages. While some recent studies suggest that the link between dietary saturated fat and heart risk is more complicated than once thought, the U.S. Dietary Guidelines still recommend that less than 10% of your daily calories come from saturated fats. And if you already have high cholesterol, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends keeping saturated fats to just 5-6% of your total daily calories. (The evidence is pretty clear on trans fats, though—minimize them as much as possible. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has even banned artificially produced trans fats, and they are being phased out of the food supply.)\n\nMonounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats, on the other hand, have the opposite effect of saturated fats and trans fats on cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk, says Dr. Feresin. In fact, according to a presidential advisory from the AHA published in *Circulation**,* replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease to an extent similar to statin treatment.\n\nRich sources of monounsaturated fats include avocado, olives, and avocado and olive oil—again, hello Mediterranean diet. Sources of polyunsaturated fats include omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which you can find in sunflower seeds, flaxseed or flaxseed oil, walnuts, and fish. And those omega-3s may be particularly protective: Not only do they help stabilize the progression of plaques that can clog heart vessels, but they’re also anti-inflammatory, says Dr. Hong—and chronic inflammation itself is an independent risk factor for heart disease. Eat fish at least twice a week, the AHA says. If you’re vegan or vegetarian, you can work on getting those omega-3s through things like flaxseed or chia seeds.\n\nGenerally, it’s best to get your omega-3s from natural food sources rather than supplements.\n\n“We never know how the supplements are absorbed,” says Dr. Hong. Plus, supplements can give you a false sense of security and lead you to eat a less balanced diet, he says. They’re also not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) like drugs are, so you can’t be exactly sure what you’re getting.\n\n## 3. Eat more fiber-rich foods.\n\nMost Americans fall short of the recommended daily intake for fiber, a form of carbohydrate—ideally, you should be taking in 14 grams for every 1,000 calories you eat.\n\nThat can be a problem, because fiber, the hard-to-digest components of foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, can help your heart in multiple ways. For one, fiber can reduce cholesterol, which can keep your arteries clearer, says Dr. Hong. Fiber can also help you regulate your blood sugar, which is important because chronic high blood sugar can put you at risk of diabetes and increase your risk of a heart attack, strokes, and other heart problems, he says. (Diabetes is also a risk factor for issues like heart attacks as well.)\n\nFiber may also help you cultivate a better, more diverse community of bacteria in your gut, which can ultimately contribute to reduced inflammation throughout your body, including in your cardiovascular system, says Dr. Hong.\n\nThen there’s the fact that naturally fiber-rich foods, like whole grains, are packed with additional helpful nutrients. Most whole grains contain B vitamins and minerals such as selenium and magnesium, says Dr. Feresin, which can help your body regulate blood pressure, ward off damage to the cells, and more.\n\nIf you’re looking for ways to add fiber, Dr. Feresin recommends choosing whole wheat pasta or brown rice pasta instead of regular pasta, brown rice rather than white rice, whole wheat bread instead of white bread, whole wheat cereal, and whole oats. Try the pseudo whole grains amaranth, chia seeds, and quinoa. Add quinoa to your salad or chia seeds to your yogurt or overnight oats, she recommends. High-fiber fruits and vegetables include raspberries, pears, apples (with the skin), bananas, green peas, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts.\n\n## 4. Watch your sodium intake.\n\nSodium is an essential mineral that helps control your body’s fluid balance. It honestly helps a lot of food taste really great, too. However, most of us consistently take in more sodium than we need—and it’s that chronic overconsumption that can become an issue for your heart. That can mean more fluid in your blood vessels, potentially leading to an increase in blood pressure that can make your heart have to work harder to pump blood throughout your body, says Dr. Feresin.\n\nTo reduce blood pressure, the AHA recommends eating no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day. Canned foods, preserved foods, and restaurant meals can be particularly high in sodium, Dr. Hong says. So can processed meats like hot dogs, salami, sausage, and ham. While delicious, the combo of sodium and saturated fat in these meats, especially if eaten frequently over time, makes them pretty unsavory for heart health, says Dr. Hong. In fact, the top source of sodium and saturated fat in the American diet is sandwiches. Which doesn’t necessarily mean you need to swear off sandwiches forever—but it’s good to know if you’re specifically trying to eat in a way that supports optimum heart health.\n\nJust as important as reducing sodium intake is upping your potassium intake, a mineral that counterbalances sodium in regulating your fluid balance, says Dr. Feresin. The average American consumes far less than the recommended amount of 4,700 mg per day.\n\nFind potassium in apricots, prunes, oranges, squash, spinach, tomato, asparagus, beans, lentils, milk, yogurt, chicken, turkey, beef, salmon, and more, Dr. Feresin says. And to add flavor to dishes without sprinkling on extra salt, try adding seasonings, like herbs, hot spices, garlic, or saffron.\n\n## 5. Fill your plate with color.\n\nFruits and vegetables are filled with fiber, and they are delivery vessels for lots of powerful micronutrients, including compounds called polyphenols. “These bioactive compounds not only contribute to taste, color, and flavor of plant foods, but they also have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hypertensive properties,” says Dr. Feresin. They help keep cholesterol from forming plaques, prevent blood cells from sticking together, improve artery dilation, decrease arterial stiffness, decrease blood pressure, and more, she says.\n\nNo one polyphenol can be considered the best, and there’s no one particular piece of produce you should pick up every single day. Variety is the key.\n\n“One of the things that we believe is that those polyphenols are acting additively and synergistically, so it’s not just one; it’s actually more than one that is exerting the effect in the body,” says Dr. Feresin. “That’s one of the reasons why we advocate the increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, because you\'re not only going to be getting a single polyphenol. You’re going to be getting hundreds of polyphenols, and getting all the other nutrients as well.”\n\nAim for at least four to six servings of fruits and vegetables per day, says Dr. Hong. (Servings also depend on factors like your activity level—check out MyPlate.gov for more info.) Mix it up so that you can take in a broad spectrum of nutrients at most meals. “I like to see on your plate at least three or four different colors,” says Dr. Hong.\n\n## 6. Limit added sugars.\n\nWhen talking about heart health, it’s a good idea to choose carbs that are rich in nutrients like fiber, rather than those that don’t bring a whole lot else to the nutrient table. That means it may be a good idea to limit your consumption of added sugars, which are often found in items like sodas, baked goods, breads, and salad dressings. “Added sugars” refers to sugars or syrups added during processing, not to the natural sugars in fruits or dairy.\n\nAdded sugars contribute to a lot of excess calories, says Dr. Hong. Calories aren’t inherently bad—you need them for energy—but if you’re looking to monitor your calorie intake for health-related reasons, like diabetes management, mainly getting them from other sources may be best. You don’t have to completely avoid *all* added sugars, but the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends limiting your consumption to no more than 10% of your daily caloric intake.\n\nNearly half of all our added sugars come from beverages, according to the guidelines, which makes what you’re drinking a solid jumping-off point for reevaluation. When you find an area where you can make a change—say, a regular soda habit—take it slowly, says Dr. Hong. Let’s say you drink four sodas a week. You could try reducing it down to two, and then later one, he says.\n\nYou may be able to notice some beneficial effects of swapping out your sugary beverages or other kinds of food in some health markers. In a study published in the *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*, people who reduced their intake of refined grains, added sugars, and sugar-sweetened beverages (and increased their intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, and nuts) reduced several markers of cardiovascular risk, such as blood pressure and fasting blood sugar, within six months.\n\n## 7. Watch your alcohol intake.\n\n“A lot of folks really underestimate how much alcohol they’re drinking,” says Dr. Hong. “They may have a drink when they get home, another drink or two with dinner, and then a nightcap.”\n\nTwo drinks a day (for men) and one a day (for women) are considered reasonable amounts—the U.S. Dietary Guidelines consider that “moderate” consumption. More than that, and you’re drinking a lot of excess sugar. “I remind patients: Guess what alcohol gets broken down to? Sugar,” says Dr. Hong. Plus, it’s easy to snack extra when you’re drinking. Like a lot of other behaviors we’ve mentioned, this isn’t an automatically “bad” eating habit that you can never practice if you want a healthy heart. But, depending on what you snack on and how often you’re snacking while drinking, frequent extra snacking on top of your regular eating patterns can lead to weight gain, another risk factor for cardiovascular disease. (The science behind weight and heart health is complex—there are other factors to consider beyond weight that you can read more about here.)\n\nWhat’s more, research suggests excess drinking can affect your heart in other ways besides weight gain. According to a study review published in the journal *Alcohol Research*, too much alcohol could contribute to increased blood pressure and inflammation, and may also promote the clumping together of platelets—which can lead to the formation of dangerous blood clots.\n\nA heart-healthy diet doesn’t have to mean never having that glass of wine, that store-bought pack of cupcakes, or that extra sprinkle of salt on your popcorn. It’s more about making small changes—and following them consistently—that can add up to a big difference for your heart.\n\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:21:06', '2021-03-10 19:37:16', '/resources/images/veggies_healthy_eating.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/heart-healthy-diet', 0, 0);

Food Stying by Drew Aichele. Prop Styling by Campbell Pearson.\r\n\r\n*Welcome to**Grocery Diaries**, a new series that illustrates just how varied and personalized “healthy eating” really is. So many factors impact the choices we make at the grocery store, including access and affordability, health conditions, our individual cultural backgrounds, even what simply makes us (and our taste buds) happy. So we asked people across the country to share their grocery lists with us, and then called up a few of them to ask for more details. Why do they buy what they buy? How much do they spend? Who are they shopping for? What health conditions or nutritional concerns are they thinking about when they choose, for instance, almond milk over cow’s milk, or particular flavors or spices or treats? In this Grocery Diaries installment, we hear from a Kentucky grocery store owner working to increase access to fresh food in Louisville’s West End.*\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n**Name:** Shauntrice Martin\r\n**Age:** 36\r\n**Occupation:** Lobbyist and grocery store owner\r\n**Location:** Louisville, Kentucky\r\n**Race/Gender:** Black woman\r\n**Health conditions/dietary restrictions to consider:** Shauntrice has a family history of diabetes and high blood pressure.\r\n**Grocery shopping frequency:** Shops twice a week for two people\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nSome of Shauntrice Martin’sfavorite childhood memories involve making dinner with her grandparents. “I learned a lot of stories about our family during that time when we were preparing meals,” she tells SELF. Shauntrice also developed an appreciation for fresh food and home-cooked meals after watching her great-grandmother pick vegetables from her farm. “I remember being able to see everything that got put in a recipe and understanding the importance of each ingredient,” she says. “If we were out of something, then the entire recipe would change.” \r\n\r\nAt home Shauntrice ate very differently. Her mom worked long hours and didn’t have time to cook, so Shauntrice frequentlyate microwaveable meals or other packaged food. What’s more, her mom just didn’t have access to fresh food at the local grocery store. “We were on food stamps, but the place we got our food from didn\'t really have fresh options,” she says. \r\nAs an adult, Shauntrice wondered whether food affected her family’s medical history. Her grandmother had diabetes and her mom developed high blood pressure, but to Shauntrice’s knowledge, her great-grandmother didn’t have these types of medical conditions. “I think a lot about the way my mother ate versus the way my great-grandmother ate, and that really influences what I eat now,” she says.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to mention that Shauntrice’s mom smoked, which is one risk factor for developinghigh blood pressure. High blood pressure happens when your blood puts excessive force against your artery walls, according to theNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). People develop high blood pressure for various reasons, including a high-sodium diet, a family history of the condition, and smoking, according to theMayo Clinic. Over time, high blood pressure can lead to other medical conditions like a heart attack. And while there are many ways to try to prevent or manage high blood pressure, regularly eating a variety of nutritious foods (especially fruits and vegetables) is one of them.\r\n\r\nShauntrice is also concerned about developingdiabetes, which happens when your blood sugar, or blood glucose, is consistently too high, theNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) explains. Glucose is our body’s main source of energy and we get it from food and drinks. People with diabetes can develop issues like nerve damage, eye problems, and kidney disease. Treatment plans vary and can include taking insulin or limiting the amount of saturated fat, sodium, and sugar you eat.\r\n\r\nWhen determining how to eat in order to feel her best and try to avoid these conditions, Shauntrice doesn’t study food labels to track things like sugar or saturated fat. To her, healthy eating means including a variety of fresh food in her diet. “I look at the colors in my basket. Do I have an array of fruits and vegetables?” she explains. But this can be a hard goal to reach. Shauntrice lives in the West End of Louisville, a predominantly Black area she says has only one large grocery store. The area is a food desert, meaning it’s a low-income community with too few grocery stores, according to theU.S. Department of Agriculture. \r\nBefore the pandemic Shauntrice grocery-shopped in a wealthier neighborhood, where the stores had a larger selection of fresh produce. Then, in June, her only local grocery store closed for a period during the Black Lives Matter protests. Shauntrice was inspired to open her own grocery store,Black Market KY, which sells products from local and Black-owned companies. “It was really important for me to do this,” she says. “The community is predominantly Black, but we don’t have a lot of Black businesses. It’s important to me that more Black businesses can make money.” Now Shauntrice shops at her own store for herself and her seven-year-old-son, Iniejah, and she also sources some of their food from other local shops and sellers. Here are 10 items she eats in a typical week.\r\n\r\n**1. Plantains: $7**\r\n\r\nShauntrice learned about plantains when she studied abroad in Trinidad during college. “I thought it was like a Trinidadian banana,” she says. “I don’t even know if I had heard the word *plantain* before.” She says living in another country for a semesteropened her mind to food that she wouldn’t normally try. “I was super picky before going out of the country,” Shauntrice says. “I committed to myself that I would try new stuff. I didn’t want to disrespect people and their food.” Now fried plantains are one of her favorite snacks. “I really like when they’re blackened,” she says.\r\n\r\n**2. Jamaican ackees: $13**\r\n\r\nDuring her time in Trinidad, Shauntrice also learned about ackee, a fruit native to West Africa and also common in the Caribbean. She rememberseating ackee with salt fish (people often eat the two together) at breakfast. At the time Shauntrice thought the large chunks of pale yellow fruit were scrambled eggs. “I thought, Maybe this isn’t a chicken egg. I didn’t ask any questions,” she says. (She later learned about ackee from her professor.) Shauntrice makes ackee at home whenever it’s in stock at her local African market. “It’s not even always at the market that I go to,” she tells us. “I usually call ahead and make sure it’s there.” With that said, Shauntrice usually eats the fruit alone instead of with its usual seafood companion: “I’m not good at making salt fish.”\r\n\r\n**3. Organic eggs from Phonograph Farms: $3**\r\n\r\nEvery three weeks Shauntrice drives three hours tobuy eggs from this farm owned by former NFL player George Wilson. “It’s our best-selling item at the store,” she says. Shauntrice says Phonograph eggs taste noticeably different from the standard grocery store egg: “They’re delicious. They’re heartier, and the yolk is thicker. They’re much fluffier when you’re making scrambled eggs or pancakes.”\r\n\r\n**4.****Wells Made Co. Roasted Banana Chip Peanut Butter****: $14**\r\n\r\nIt was love at first taste when Shauntrice tried thisbanana peanut butter at a women-owned business pop-up event in 2019. “There’s little banana chips in it. It’s kind of like cookies and cream ice cream but with banana chips,” she says. “It just tastes really good, and it’s super sweet from the banana. I haven’t had a nut butter with that element in it.” She eats this on top of cinnamon raisin toast and in her smoothies.\r\n\r\n**5.****Beeing2Gether** **raw honey: $6**\r\n\r\nShauntrice’s friends frequently tag her in Facebook posts about Louisville businesses. That’s how Shauntrice learned about Keith Griffith III, a 13-year-old beekeeper and owner of Beeing2Gether honey. She loved his ambition and supports Keith by selling his honey at Black Market KY. “When I was 13, I wasn’t thinking about starting a business,” she says. “I own a business now, and I can’t imagine being mature enough to do that even 10 years ago. That’s amazing to me.” She likes to drizzle honey on her baked fish, in her smoothies, and on top ofpancakes.\r\n\r\n![Image may contain Animal Seafood Food Sea Life Lobster and Ribs](/resources/images/medium12102020-R_C-Chelsea-Kyle-1782.jpg)\r\n\r\nChelsea Kyle. Food Stying by Drew Aichele. Prop Styling by Campbell Pearson.\r\n\r\n**6.****Sausage from Cleav’s Family Market**: **$10**\r\n\r\nShauntrice carries meat from Black-owned farm Cleav’s Family Market at her store and also buystheir ground meats for herself. “What I usually do is get hamburger and sausage, and I mix the two,” Shauntrice says. Then she adds in chopped celery, bell pepper, onions, and garlic to make “water burgers,” named for the fact that they’re extra juicy with the added vegetables. “That’s how my great-grandmother used to make burgers,” she says.\r\n\r\n**7. Trader Joe’s Organic Roasted Seaweed With Sea Salt: $3.49**\r\n\r\n“I go through so many of these every week—probably like 20 packs,” Shauntrice says. “I always crack one open in the car on the way home from Trader Joe’s.” Initially she bought these for Iniejah when he was a toddler but has grown to love them too. In fact, she always keeps a few in her purse in case she wants acrispy snack when running errands.\r\n\r\n**8. Smucker’s Uncrustables Peanut Butter & Grape Jelly Sandwich: $7.79**\r\n\r\nIniejah is allowed to make anything thatdoesn’t need to be cooked, which explains why he goes through at least one box of Uncrustables a week. “He’s into making his own stuff. I think he really just likes the independence,” Shauntrice says. Plus, he can unwrap one without worrying about cleaning up after himself. “He could make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but then he has to wash dishes and I think he’d rather not.”\r\n\r\n**9.****Blue Diamond Almond Breeze Almond Milk Vanilla****: $1.99**\r\n\r\n“When I was pregnant, dairy did not sit well with my stomach and I just stuck with almond milk afterward,” Shauntrice says of her milk preference. “Our first choice is the vanilla sweetened, but a lot of times that’s out for some reason.” Living ina food desert, she can’t always find the food she wants, such as organic produce and this almond milk. When she does find this almond milk while shopping, Shauntrice buys extra so she always has some on hand.\r\n\r\n**10. Apple juice from Ida’s Juice: $5**\r\n\r\nShuantrice used to buy her apple juice from a woman named Ida, a local Louisville mom. “You would message her on Facebook with your order and she delivered it to your home.” So what made Ida’s juice so special? Shauntrice says it reminded her of the fresh-pressed cider she likes to drink in the fall. Ida doesn’t sell juice anymore, Shauntrice says, so Shauntrice’shomemade smoothies have replaced her juice habit instead. “My favorite blend is probably one with cilantro, lime, and kale. It’s super tangy,” she says.\r\n\r\n*All products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (56, 11, 'Which of the Pregnancy Food Rules Are Worth Paying Attention To?', 'There’s a lot of info out there—here’s what matters.', '![What Pregnancy Food Rules Should You Actually Follow](/resources/images/preg_woman%252520healthy_eating.jpeg)Caiaimage/Paul Bradbury/Adobe Stock\r\n\r\n“Healthy eating” is complicated, and it gets even more so when you add your soon-to-be baby into the mix. But what pregnancy food rules are worth paying attention to, and which ones are just overblown?\r\n\r\nWhile it’s always a good idea to eat a generally well-balanced diet full of nutrient-rich choices, it becomes even more crucial when you’re pregnant. You don’t need to suddenly double your calories to “eat for two” once you’re expecting—yep, that’s one of the pregnancy food myths right there—but you do need to eat enough of the right nutrients to keep your body running smoothly and your baby developing properly.\r\n\r\n“Nutrition is always important, but especially so during pregnancy because what you eat is going to be the main source of nutrition for the baby,” Jaime Tucker, R.D., a dietitian in the ob-gyn department atUC Davis Health, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nThat’s why the time when you’re thinking about getting pregnant can be a great opportunity to take a look at your eating habits to see where you’re at currently, and what you may need to focus more on.\r\n\r\nIt’s a chance for you to make a change in your life that you can continue after your child is born,Manijeh Kamyar, M.D., a high-risk ob-gyn, member of the editorial task force for*Your Pregnancy and Childbirth*, a book published by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and a past member of ACOG’s Patient Education Review Panel, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nHealthy eating during pregnancy looks a little different for each person (though there are some general recommendations), and misconceptions about what to eat and what not to eat at this major life stage abound. Cutting through the noise and focusing on the expert recommendations that actually deserve your attention will make it easier to take care of both you and your baby.\r\n\r\nBecause the truth is, healthy eating during pregnancy doesn’t look *that* different from healthy eating before and after pregnancy—save for a few key things.\r\n\r\n## Pregnancy nutrition is about focusing on a healthy diet in general.\r\n\r\nThe most basic tenets of healthy eating are the same when you’re pregnant and when you’re not. “If you follow the general guidelines for appropriate nutrition outside of pregnancy, you’re pretty much following what you’re supposed to do inside pregnancy as well,” Dr. Kamyar says. That means focusing on eating nutrient-rich foods, like fruits, vegetables, lean meats, whole grains, poultry, and fish, and limiting the amount of foods you eat that are low in nutrients and high inadded sugars and saturated or trans fats, she says. If you’re already doing that, you’re off to a good start.\r\n\r\nThe exact amount ofprotein andcarbohydrates you need to get every day will depend on multiple factors, including your health going into pregnancy, how your baby is developing, your dietary restrictions, and your activity levels. ACOG does, however, note thatfats should make up about 20 to 35 percent of a pregnant person’s total calorie intake. Fat is important for fetal brain development, and your body needs it to properly absorb and use some vitamins.\r\n\r\nTo get a general idea of how many grams of carbs, protein, and fat you should eat each day, ACOG recommends starting with the food-planning guide atMyPlate, which can help you determine a well-balanced diet. (Of course, it’s important to recognize that this kind of tracking can be triggering for people with disordered eating.) If you can work with a registered dietitian for a more personalized plan, that’s great too.\r\n\r\nAs for nutrients, certain vitamins and minerals are important in *any* diet, not just during pregnancy. While eating whole foods can make it easier to check off important pregnancy nutrients (more on that later) without thinking too hard about it, not everyone has the same access to fresh foods. It’s totally fine if packaged and “processed” foods are part of your diet for whatever reason, whether because of access or because of cravings (or both). In fact, processed foods—which just mean a food has been combined with another ingredient or changed from its natural state—can include nutrient-rich choices like whole wheat bread, almond butter, and yogurt, as SELFreported previously. And people’s cultures often impact the foods that make up their usual diet,Amy Valent, D.O., maternal-fetal medicine specialist and assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology in the Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine, tells SELF. That’s all the more reason why our societal understanding of what automatically is or isn’t “healthy” to have (during pregnancy and otherwise) needs to change.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, pregnancy nutrition isn’t all or nothing: It’s not about being perfect every single day, but making choices that help promote great health *most* of the time. “Do your best with what you have, and whatever efforts you’re able to put in,” Dr. Valent says. Evenlearning how to read nutrition labels so that you can make informed choices where possible—say, looking to see if a food has a lot of saturated fats so you can consider opting for a similar option with less—is a great first step, she says.\r\n\r\n## On top of the basics, there are some nutrients you do need more of when you’re pregnant.\r\n\r\nFolic acid\r\n\r\nFolic acid is the human-made version of folate, a B vitamin. (Folic acid and folate are often used interchangeably.) The vitamin is important for pregnant people because it may help prevent defects in the neural tube, the part of the embryo that eventually becomes the baby’s brain and spinal cord.\r\n\r\nBecause these defects form in the early stages of pregnancy, guidelines suggest supplementing with folic acid before you even starttrying to get pregnant. If you’re thinking about getting pregnant (or are having sex with someone who can get you pregnant and are not using protection), you should be on it, Dr. Kamyar says.\r\n\r\nACOG guidelines recommend pregnant people get 600 micrograms of folate or folic acid per day. Since it’s hard to get that much from food, they recommend supplementing with a prenatal vitamin containing at least 400 micrograms of folic acid, starting at least one month before you start trying to become pregnant, and then continuing for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. For the other 200 micrograms, you can find folate in fortified cereal, bread, and pasta products, dark leafy greens, orange juice, beans, and peanuts.\r\n\r\nCholine\r\n\r\nCholine is a nutrient that plays a role in fetal brain development. Getting enough of it during pregnancy may help prevent some common birth defects, according to ACOG.The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services recommends pregnant people get 450 milligrams per day. It’s actually not very common in prenatal vitamins, so it’s important to make sure you’re getting it from the foods you eat. Chicken, beef, animal liver, eggs (especially the yolk), milk, soy, and peanuts are all good sources of choline. Potatoes, cruciferous vegetables Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower), and some beans, nuts, seeds, and whole grains also contain some choline.\r\n\r\nIron\r\n\r\nIron is a mineral that your body uses to transport oxygen in your blood. During pregnancy, your body uses it to make the extra blood you and your baby need. If you don\'t take in enough of the mineral,you can develop iron-deficiency anemia, which can make you feel really weak or tired. Recommendations suggest pregnant people get 27 milligrams per day (compared to the 18 milligrams recommended for non-pregnant women).\r\n\r\nYou may be able to get enough iron through your diet, though Dr. Valent notes that iron-rich foods—like red meat, poultry, and fish—may be tough to consume in large enough amounts. (These animal sources are known as heme iron.) Plant-based sources of iron (known as non-heme iron), like soybeans, spinach, and lentils, contain a type of iron that’s a little harder for our bodies to absorb than heme iron sources. Combining these foods with foods rich in vitamin C (likecitrus fruits) can help your body absorb the iron better. Also, most prenatal vitamins contain some iron to fill in the gaps in your diet. If you do wind up developing iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy, your doctor may suggest taking an iron supplement that has more of this mineral than a prenatal—and it\'s worth noting that iron supplementsmay cause a whole host of unpleasant GI symptoms in some people. While it\'s not always possible to avoid iron-deficiency anemia, trying to stay on top of your iron intake during pregnancy is a great call.\r\n\r\nIodine\r\n\r\nIodine is a mineral that your body uses to makethyroid hormones, which are important for fetal bone and brain development. Pregnant people should get 220 micrograms daily (up from 150 micrograms for non-pregnant adults).\r\n\r\nMost people in the U.S. get plenty of iodine because it’s added to table salt. But Dr. Valent says that since more people are cooking with sea salt and kosher salt, both of which are generally not fortified with iodine, it may not be easy for everyone to get enough during pregnancy. TheAmerican Thyroid Association recommends that all pregnant and breastfeeding people take a daily prenatal vitamin that contains 150 micrograms of iodine to make up for any gap you may have in your diet—dietary sources include dairy, eggs, saltwater fish, shellfish, seaweed, and soy milk.\r\n\r\nCalcium, Vitamin D, and Vitamin C\r\n\r\nVitamin C, calcium, and vitamin D play a role in building your baby’s bones. (In fact, if you don’t get enough calcium during pregnancy, your baby cantake what they need from *your* bones.) In addition, vitamin D contributes to skin and eye development, and vitamin C helps your immune system function properly.\r\n\r\nAll three of these nutrients are important during pregnancy. The recommended daily amount of vitamin C during pregnancy is slightly elevated from non-pregnancy, from 65 to 80 milligrams for people 18 and under, and from 75 to 85 milligrams for those 19 and older. Citrus fruits, broccoli,tomatoes, and strawberries are all good sources of vitamin C.\r\n\r\nThere’s no recommendation for increasing intake of calcium or vitamin D during pregnancy; it’s just extra important to make sure you’re getting the usual recommended daily amounts. For calcium, that’s 1,300 milligrams for those who are 18 and younger and 1,000 milligrams for those 19 and older. For vitamin D, that’s 600 international units (IU) or 15 micrograms. Fortified milk and fatty fish such as salmon and sardines are the best food sources of vitamin D. (Sunlight is also a source of vitamin D, but you should wear sunscreen whenever you’ll be outdoors for more than a few minutes, so getting enough vitamin D from food is going to be easier.) You can get calcium from dairy products like milk, yogurt, or cheese, or other foods like sardines, kale, and broccoli.\r\n\r\n## There are general guidelines for extra calories and weight gain, but it’s not an exact science.\r\n\r\nTucker says that while yes, you’re eating for two in a sense—what you eat gives your growing baby the nutrients they need, too—you don’t need to double the quantity of food you consume once you’re pregnant. In fact, your calorie needs don’t increase all that drastically during pregnancy, she says.\r\n\r\n“During the first trimester, you don\'t really have additional calorie needs, and then you only need about 340 more per day in the second trimester and 450 in the third trimester,” Tucker says. (Those ACOG guidelines are higher if you’re pregnant with multiple babies—about 300 more calories per additional fetus.) You can meet those needs by adding one or twoextra snacks throughout the day. Of course, everyone’s calorie needs vary depending on things like body size and activity level, so it’s important to think of it as 340 or 450 calories *more* than your non-pregnancy norm, rather than looking for specific numbers that all pregnant people should aim for.\r\n\r\nNavigating the calorie situation during pregnancy can be really tough, to say the least. “We know gaining too much weightabove the recommendation] puts someone at risk [for conditions like hypertension and [gestational diabetes]. On the other hand, trying to *avoid* weight gain with behaviors like crash dieting can also increase the chances of pregnancy complications,” Dr. Valent says.\r\nWhat constitutes healthy weight gain during pregnancy depends in large part on your weight going into it. For example, someone with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5-24.9 going into pregnancy should gain about 25-35 pounds if they’re pregnant with one baby, according to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The numbers are lower for someone with a higher BMI than this, and higher for someone with a lower BMI than this. The thing is that BMI is far from a perfect measure of health (more on that,here), and ultimately, a guideline is just a guideline. \r\n\r\nWhat\'s more, the weight situation becomes even more complicated since some people may actually end up *losing* weight in the first trimester due to food aversions, nausea, or vomiting. Plus, weight gain isn\'t exactly consistent through pregnancy, and some ofwhat you are gaining is increased fluid and blood volume.\r\n\r\nDealing with confusing pregnancy guidelines surrounding the already fraught topic of weight is incredibly stressful. Focusing on developing a healthy lifestyle and healthy pregnancy overall is paramount to worrying about specific calorie counts (and if you do have aversions to “healthy” foods, getting some fuel in you is more important than being strict about what you are eating). This broader approach can also be especially helpful if you have issues with or difficulty with tracking your weight and calories.\r\n\r\nThat being said, you should always work with your health care provider whenever possible to make sure what you’re doing related to food during your pregnancy is helping instead of hurting you. (Though some health care providers can be unhelpful and stressful when it comes to anythingweight-related, which only makes this more complex.) As long as your baby is growing properly on ultrasounds and you’re not excluding whole food groups or consistently deficient in any single nutrient, then you’re probably doing just fine, says Tucker. \r\n\r\n## It’s true there *are* some foods you should try to avoid during pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe following foods make this short list because they are associated with an elevated risk offoodborne illness or other potential risks to a baby’s healthy development. Foodborne illnesses, like listeriosis, salmonella, and E.coli, can make a person very ill and dehydrated, which can lead to poor pregnancy outcomes like preterm labor and contractions and even cause someone to pass out and fall, Dr. Kamyar says. Listeriosis, in particular, has been linked to more serious complications, including miscarriage and stillbirth.\r\n\r\nRaw and smoked seafood, raw meat, raw eggs, deli meat, hot dogs, and unpasteurized dairy\r\n\r\nThe reason experts recommend avoiding these foods is because they all come with a higher-than-normal risk of contamination. “Sushi made with raw fish can have parasites that can make you ill; unpasteurized milk products (like some soft cheeses, though you can eat pasteurized versions) can carry listeria and other diseases,” Dr. Kamyar says. Ditto with raw meat, smoked seafood, deli meats, and yes, even hot dogs. “The problem with hot dogs and lunch meats is that if they’re left out and not refrigerated and they aren’t handled hygienically, that’s when you risk infection with bacteria,” Dr. Kamyar says. It\'s also important to note that some conventionally “healthy” foods like sprouts, celery, and cantaloupe have also caused listeria outbreaks, theCDC says.\r\n\r\nThat being said, you could of course get food poisoning from other foods. It’s just that it tends to happen more frequently in these ones, so avoiding them is a realistic way to minimize your risk, Dr. Kamyar says.\r\n\r\nHigh-mercury fish\r\n\r\nFish is actually a really healthy food to eat during pregnancy. ACOGrecommends eating at least two servings of fish or shellfish per week to get a good dose of omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for your baby’s brain development. Fish is also a great source of protein, Dr. Kamyar adds.\r\n\r\nBut you want to avoid fish that tends to contain a lot of mercury, which has been linked to birth defects. These include marlin, shark, swordfish, tilefish, orange roughy, bigeye tuna, and king mackerel. Instead, stick to smaller fish, like tilapia, catfish, and salmon. Canned white (albacore) tuna is also OK in moderation—ACOG suggests limiting consumption to 6 ounces per week to be mindful of mercury.\r\n\r\nOther supplements besides prenatals\r\n\r\nExpertsrecommend taking prenatal vitamins before and during pregnancy, so that you can make sure you’re getting all the important nutrients you and your baby need. But you shouldn’t take that to mean you should load up on *all* supplements.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the currently very popular CBD hasn’t been well-studied in pregnancy—“we don’t really know what it does to a pregnancy,” says Dr. Kamyar—so that’s one supplement you should skip. Like other supplements, it’s also unregulated, so there’s no way to know what’s actually in it.\r\n\r\nEven regular multivitamins might not be a good idea on top of your prenatals. Dr. Kamyar says that some multivitamins may have high levels of vitamin A. Gettingtoo much vitamin A during pregnancy has been associated with birth defects in the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and spontaneous abortion. Of course, you need *some* vitamin A—it’s important most notably for healthy eye development. Dr. Kamyar says that as long as you’re not supplementing with it, and just getting vitamin A from foods like sweet potatoes and carrots and your prenatal, you shouldn’t be concerned about taking in too-high amounts.\r\n\r\nBottom line: Always talk to your doctor before taking any sort of supplement, no matter how natural and harmless it sounds, during pregnancy.\r\n\r\n## Experts also suggest cutting back on caffeine—and completely avoiding alcohol.\r\n\r\nYou may not need to *stop* your daily coffee habit, but depending on how much you’re drinking, you may need to cut down on it: Experts recommend limiting caffeine intake during pregnancy to 200 milligrams or less per day. That’s about the amount in one 12-ounce cup of coffee (thoughcaffeine content varies by roast and brewing method).\r\n\r\nThe reason? Experts know that caffeine crosses the placenta, meaning it can be passed onto the baby if the pregnant person consumes it. But research about just how much caffeine is OK before it may interfere with fetal development is inconclusive. There are also some concerns about a potential relationship between caffeine and an increased incidence of spontaneous miscarriage, but the studies done so far are, again, inconclusive. Until we know more, it may be best to stick to that 200 milligram max to be safe.\r\n\r\nAs for alcohol? Whileyou might have heard from a friend or a book that light drinking during pregnancy may be OK, both ACOG and the CDC strongly say that drinking any type of alcohol, at any time during pregnancy, can potentially impact your baby’s development and cause birth defects and lifelong behavior problems. That recommendation is not without controversy, though. Some studies, including a2012 Danish study of 1,628 women and their children at 5 years of age, have reached confusing conclusions, suggesting that low to moderate alcohol consumption (less than eight drinks a week) during early pregnancy may not ultimately impact the child’s brain function. On the other hand, a2013 *Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research* systematic review and meta-analysis found that, based on three studies of approximately 11,900 children aged 9 months to 5 years, moderate drinking during pregnancy (up to six drinks a week) was associated with behavioral problems. And whileprior U.K. guidelines limited alcohol during pregnancy to one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week—two units being the equivalent of a medium-sized glass of wine—they revised them in 2016 to show that no level of alcohol is safe to drink.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to caffeine, we just don’t really have solid research that confirms an exact amount of drinking alcohol is safe at any point in pregnancy (it’s not exactly easy or morally sound to do studies where a pregnant person drinks alcohol and waits to see how it impacts their baby’s health). Until we have more robust studies and concrete evidence on how much, exactly, might be safe, it’s safer to just not do it at all, Dr. Valent says. At the same time, some people find the guidelines of “do not drink if you might have the remote chance of becoming pregnant” paternalistic and overreaching. On that note, if you happened to drink a small amount of alcohol before you knew you were pregnant, serious harm to your baby from that is unlikely, according to ACOG—the best course of action would be to not drink more after learning of your pregnancy.\r\n\r\nWhile having to skip those cups of coffee—or turn down a poached egg for breakfast or your regular glass of wine with dinner—can be annoying, it can be helpful to reframe your pregnancy eating in your mind: Instead of looking at pregnancy as a time when you can’t have certain things, think of it as an opportunity to check in on how you’re nourishing your body. It’s a time to give your body what it needs to be healthy and grow another human—that’s pretty awesome, right? The bonus is that you’ll learn some great things about eating nutrient-rich foods and taking care of yourself that you can keep using beyond pregnancy, too. And on those days when even that change in focus doesn’t take away the sting of foregoing certain foods and drinks during pregnancy, the good news is that it won’t last forever.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:22:44', '2021-03-10 19:38:32', '/resources/images/preg_woman%2520healthy_eating.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/pregnancy-food-rules-to-follow', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (57, 11, 'How to Eat Healthy, According to 11 R.D.s', 'Here\'s how to get more nutrition and joy from your diet. ', '![woman eating donut](https://media.self.com/photos/5f490e4e4a75ee30a626683e/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/woman_food_donut.jpeg)Victor Espadas/Adobe Stock\n\nIf you\'re wondering how to eat healthy—how, exactly, to fuel your body and mind with the nutrition you need to feel your best—well, that\'s a great question. Many of us have some nebulous idea of what healthy eating is and is not, but when you break it all down, the actual logistics behind how to eat healthy aren\'t always easy to clear or intuitive. In fact, it\'s really freaking confusing sometimes.\n\nFirst off, there are a lot of opinions and information (and misinformation) out there, so it’s hard to know what to listen to. This has resulted in a really narrow view of healthy eating that is steeped in diet culture, which has skewed a lot of our thinking about what healthy eating advice should sound like. This diet culture-based messaging often pushes restriction and prescriptive rules that don’t take into account the personal, cultural, and socioeconomic factors that influence what a healthy diet looks like for any one individual. Connected to that is the assumption, largely fueled by fatphobia, that healthy eating is synonymous with eating to lose weight.\n\nIn other words: It\'s only natural to be anywhere from a little to extremely lost on how to actually eat healthy. So, for some guidance on how to expand that healthy eating definition, we asked 11 registered dietitians from a variety of backgrounds, personally and professionally, for their best tips on healthy eating that are flexible and empowering, instead of rigid and punishing. They shared practical pieces of advice that can make it easier for people to enrich and diversify the nutrition in their diets and make their own delicious, satisfying meals—as well as, just as important, cultivate a more peaceful and enjoyable relationship with food and eating. Take the tips that speak to you, and add them to your very own one-of-a-kind healthy eating toolbox.\n\n## 1. Reject one-size-fits-all diets.\n\n“Diet culture is inherently homogenizing with its wide, sweeping health recommendations and generic weight loss prescriptions. Not only are we incredibly diverse on a nutritional level, we\'re exponentially more complex on a health level. So if someone is telling you they discovered the right diet for most bodies, you can take that as a signal that this is not based in science and it is probably going to take you further away from yourself.” —*Lindsay Birchfield M.S, R.D., L.D., health and body activist and dietitian at* *Creating Peace With Food* *and* *Rooted Heart Health Care*\n\n## 2. Make sure you’re actually eating enough throughout the day.\n\n\"The most important aspect of healthy eating is whether you\'re eating enough. Sounds basic, but so many people are going long stretches of time without eating during the day, either because it\'s the latest diet fad, or because they get wrapped up in what they\'re doing. You\'ll feel much more alert and energized if you\'re eating something every three to four hours or so throughout the day.\" —*Rachael Hartley, R.D., certified intuitive eating counselor and owner of* *Rachael Hartley Nutrition*\n\n## 3. Focus on including more foods, not taking foods out.\n\n“Think about foods to add in rather than take out. It’s very popular and on-trend to want to consistently remove foods or food groups (like carbohydrates or fruit), but that will only make most people feel as though they are ‘obsessive’ with food. You can still eat what you like, but maybe think about adding some veggies on top of your pizza or on the side for balance, for example. I had a client who loved instant ramen noodles. I told her to keep the noodles, but add in some protein for staying power (such as grilled chicken, tofu, or beans) and throw in some chopped spinach and bell peppers for veggies. Adding in, not taking away.” —*Shana Minei Spence, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N., founder of* *The Nutrition Tea*\n\n## 4. Create a list of your values, then think about how well your relationship to food aligns with them.\n\n“This is something I talk about with every client, because it’s so insightful for understanding our motivations and behaviors. Some examples of important values might be: open-mindedness, honesty, respect, or kindness, among many others. Try to connect your actions around food or eating to your values to see whether they uphold them or not.\n\nFor example, if you value honesty but you aren’t being honest with yourself about your food preferences, there is tension there that may be harming your relationship with food or your long-term well-being. Additionally, if you value respect yet you are not respecting your body’s energy needs or cravings for certain foods, you may notice some opportunities to make changes. If you attempt this, be sure to stay grounded in a place of non-judgment; this exercise is intended to cultivate curiosity only without inflicting further guilt or shame for what you might uncover in the process.” —*Cara Harbstreet, M.S. R.D. L.D. of* *Street Smart Nutrition*\n\n## 5. Intentionally include social and cultural connections in your food experiences.\n\n\"If your idea of healthy eating only focuses on the nutrient density of foods and you find yourself thinking about food all day long, even when you believe you’ve eaten enough, you may be missing one or all of these key ingredients: pleasure, satisfaction, and social connection]. Expand your definition of healthy eating by including these key ingredients into your meal choices whenever possible.\n\nWATCH\n\nBeginner-Friendly Guided Meditation with Jessamyn Stanley\n\nTry scheduling a Zoom meal with friends or family while you reminisce on the good times. Recreate your favorite childhood meals to bring back fond memories and a pleasurable eating experience. Or for variety and comforting nostalgia, incorporate recipes and ingredients from your culture into your meals.” —*Ayana Habtemariam**, M.S.W., R.D.N., L.D.N., nutrition therapist and certified intuitive eating counselor*\n\n## 6. Describe your food in ways besides “healthy” and “unhealthy.”\n\n“Get creative with how you describe or think about your food. Typically, we’re used to thinking about food in organized categories like healthy or unhealthy, good or bad. But these labels can promote either an all-or-nothing pattern (where you think you shouldn’t have certain foods if they aren’t considered healthy or good) or a cycle of guilt and shame if you enjoy foods you consider less nourishing.\n\nInstead, I encourage you to get as creative as you can with how you describe your food. Make a list of as many descriptive words (spicy, savory, crunchy, melty, etc.) as you can. This can point you toward your true food preferences versus the food rules you absorbed from diet culture.” —*Cara Harbstreet, M.S. R.D. L.D.*\n\n## 7. Speed up your cooking.\n\n“Maximizing your time in the kitchen is so important, especially as we all are navigating uncharted waters. Using basic items like triple-washed and bagged greens or pre-chopped veggies cuts prep time in half. And brands like Brooklyn Delhi or Saffron Road have incredibly flavorful simmer sauces that bring life to any dish in under five minutes. A close friend just brought me some of the Brooklyn Dehli achar sauces, and I am a new convert—and the ingredient list is amazing.” —*Maya Feller, M.S., R.D., C.D.N. of Brooklyn-based* *Maya Feller Nutrition**,* Good Morning America *nutrition expert, and author of* The Southern Comfort Food Diabetes Cookbook: Over 100 Recipes for a Healthy Life\n\n## 8. Try mindful eating, even if just for a single bite.\n\n“Practicing mindful eating can help us reclaim some of the joy of eating, and allows us to discover our actual food preferences. Mindful eating is turning attention to the senses—the sight, smell, feel, and taste of a food. To eat mindfully means we take the time to really experience the foods we eat.\n\nI always recommend people start small, with just one mindful bite! So…to start, take a few deep breaths as you prepare to really taste your food. Take a moment to notice the color, the smell, the texture, and just take one bite. Take your time letting it sit on your tongue, chewing slowly, allowing your taste buds to take it all in. That’s all you need to do. You might notice that the food tastes different when you actually allow yourself to taste it.” —*Erica Leon*, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N., nutrition therapist and certified eating disorder registered dietitian*\n\n## 9. Add more fiber to your diet.\n\n“Fiber is integral to gut health. Not only is fiber responsible for keeping you regular, but it\'s also integral to helping your body colonize its good gut bacteria. Adding fiber-rich foods to your daily routine can be quite simple. Try an ancient grain like bulgur (which has almost 30% of the D.V. for fiber) or barley.” —*Maya Feller, M.S., R.D., C.D.N.*\n\n## 10. Don’t worry so much about “eating the rainbow.”\n\n“We often feel like we need to make our plates super colorful by adding veggies, but so many veggies aren\'t necessarily colorful. I think it\'s time to rethink that. Even if your plate is super monotone, don\'t worry—add the veggie that goes with the dish and will complement it. For example, I grew up eating Dominican meals, where we have a lot of root veggies such as yuca, yautia, and malanga. Not colorful at all, but loaded with nutrition. If you can, try new and different veggies, regardless of color.” —*Dalina Soto M.A., R.D., L.D.N., bilingual dietitian and founder of* *Nutritiously Yours* *and* *Your Latina Nutrition*\n\n## 11. Go for more regular ol’ veggies over trendy “superfoods.”\n\n“If you just do one thing, add more vegetables. Just regular vegetables. The majority of Americans don\'t meet the recommended daily intake for vegetables. And while it\'s fun to explore superfood powders and special drinks for better health, simply adding an extra cup of an everyday vegetable like roasted broccoli to dinner can help move the needle in a positive direction.” *—**Marisa Moore**, M.B.A., R.D.N., L.D., culinary and integrative dietitian*\n\n## 12. Skip the “healthy version” and eat the food you’re actually craving.\n\n“There is no need to compromise your taste buds with ‘alternative’ foods because we are told these are healthier—chickpea cookie dough, cauliflower anything, black bean brownies. When we are told we can’t have the real thing or feel that we have to ‘healthify’ everything, we then tend to think about those eliminated foods solely and think that we’re obsessed with or addicted to food. Instead, give yourself permission to eat the foods you like, including the foods you crave.” —*Shana Minei Spence, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N.*\n\n## 13. Seek out phytonutrients. (Ya know, plants!)\n\n“Phytonutrients are chemical compounds produced by plants, and are known to be beneficial to humans because they include antioxidants, which help protect the body from free radical damage. Fruits like blueberries are an excellent source of phytonutrients—blueberries contain anthocyanins and flavanols, which have been heavily researched for their cardioprotective capabilities. They can be enjoyed fresh or frozen and added to both sweet and savory meals. Or spice up your meals with garlic and onions. When stored properly, they have a long shelf life.” —*Maya Feller, M.S., R.D., C.D.N.*\n\n## 14. Eat when you’re hungry.\n\n“Your body is not on a timer. Eat when you are hungry. I’ve heard of some people being hungry mid-morning, but thinking that they shouldn’t eat because it’s not officially lunchtime. If you are hungry at 11 a.m., know that it’s okay to eat. Our bodies and their needs change daily (due to hormones, movement, activity, etc.). So just because you ate at 1 p.m. yesterday does not mean there is anything wrong with you if you need food earlier today. We are not robots or machines that go off of an autopilot, we are indeed human.” —*Shana Minei Spence, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N.*\n\n## 15. Batch prep grains and veggies, then mix and match them throughout the week.\n\n“This is a practical tip that makes it easy to build meals throughout the week without repeating the same recipe five times. Cook rice or quinoa and roast vegetables in bulk so you can easily add your favorite protein for a quick lunch or dinner bowl during the week. Mix and match to keep it interesting—toss the roasted vegetables onto pizza one night and serve alongside salmon the next. I also like to boil a batch of eggs at the beginning of the week to use for snacks and breakfast throughout the week.” —*Marisa Moore, M.B.A. R.D.N. L.D.*\n\n## 16. Create some new food traditions for yourself.\n\n“Food is strongly tied to memories and experiences, but when our eating habits have been strongly driven by diets or dieting, we tend to lose those traditions. Think back to some of your positive memories with food and see if you can either recreate them or replicate them in new traditions. This might be as simple as selecting a new recipe once a week to developing an entirely new way of celebrating major holidays. This can be an empowering and fulfilling way to celebrate food beyond its nutrition capacity and create a new food culture that doesn’t involve dieting or restriction.” —*Cara Harbstreet, M.S. R.D. L.D.*\n\n## 17. Add fresh herbs to basically everything.\n\n“The oils naturally present in fresh herbs like basil, parsley, and oregano add lots of flavor. Two tablespoons of fresh basil deliver about 25% of the Vitamin K you need in a day. And fresh parsley is not just a garnish—it’s a great source of vitamins A and C and an excellent source of Vitamin K. (Over 75% of the D.V. in one tablespoon!) Add fresh herbs generously to salads, make herbed vinaigrette to drizzle on fish, or add them to water.” —*Marisa Moore, M.B.A., R.D.N., L.D.*\n\n## 18. Keep ingredients for go-to pantry meals in stock.\n\n\"Keep ingredients on hand for a couple of tasty and nutritious pantry meals. That way, on days you don\'t have a chance to go to the grocery store or don\'t feel like cooking anything complicated, you\'ve still got options. My favorite is pasta tossed with canned chickpeas and frozen spinach sautéed with lots of onion, garlic, and chili flakes.” —*Rachael Hartley, R.D.*\n\n## 19. Delete or mute your food tracking apps.\n\n“This is one of the simplest yet most challenging tips. We can grow reliant on apps to guide eating decisions, but that creates a false sense of safety. That’s why it can feel so precarious to consider deleting them. This is one of the most important steps to reconnecting with hunger and fullness and learning to trust your body.” —*Cara Harbstreet, M.S., R.D., L.D.*\n\n## 20. Eat whichever meals whenever you darn well please.\n\n“Lose the labels. Ever notice how easily we categorize food into ‘breakfast/lunch/dinner’? This line of thinking can hold you back. A part of you is saying an ‘I can\'t…’ story, like ‘I can\'t eat this for breakfast.’ Some of my favorite breakfasts look more like lunch—a piece of hearty toast with mayo, tomato, basil, salt and pepper, for example. Likewise, cheesy eggs wrapped in a tortilla with any veggie I have on hand is a fast dinner go-to for me. Then I\'ll add in sides of fruit or my favorite bowl of cereal or dessert, depending on my cravings.” —*Rebecca Scritchfield, R.D.N., author of* Body Kindness\n\n## 21. Roast frozen veggies for an easy, delicious side.\n\n“I *love* frozen veggies. They can be super affordable and last a while in the freezer. My fave thing to do is to load up on frozen brussels sprouts, green beans, broccoli, peas, and carrots, and just throw them into dishes to add flavor and texture. The air fryer is my favorite kitchen gadget, so I roast a lot of these veggies in there tossed in olive oil, garlic salt, and Parmesan cheese. Or you can roast them in the oven until golden brown. Such a crowd-pleaser and super quick to make. ” —*Dalina Soto M.A., R.D., L.D.N.*\n\n## 22. Meal prep regularly, but try not to stress about it.\n\n“Have a reliable meal prep routine to avoid overthinking, which can lead to a downward spiral of unhelpful stress and anxiety around eating. And be flexible in what you consider a ‘good enough’ meal prep effort, given your time and money resources. For example, I try to set a 30-minute timer on Friday nights and have a notepad at the ready. I open up my refrigerator and freezer, toss the moldy stuff to compost, quickly prep any fresh vegetable that may be on its last leg (usually by sautéeing, roasting, or making a quick base for chili or soup), and chop up any fruit to freeze and use later with baked oatmeal or smoothies.\n\nAfter that sprint, I usually have several ideas for the next set of meals and favorites to restock. The time I invest in less-than-perfect prep ahead pays off in dividends when I\'m cruising through a busy week and all I need to do is reach for something that\'s practically prepped and get it on the plate. This actually gives me time to eat mindfully and enjoy the taste too!” *—Rebecca Scritchfield, R.D.N.*\n\n## 23. When in doubt, put some fruit and nuts on it.\n\n“Add fresh fruit to a scoop of gelato or sorbet, or fresh fruit and nuts (like almonds or peanuts) to a scoop of ice cream for additional fiber and protein to help keep you feeling more satisfied. I personally love adding mango, berries, and sliced almonds to my sweet treat. And I *love* blending granola and nut butter into my fruit smoothies. You get a mix of healthy fats and more fiber which will help keep you full for a longer period of time. It is also perfect for an on-the-go breakfast.” —[*Yasi Ansari**, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D., national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Assistant Director of Performance Nutrition for UC Berkeley Athletics*', 0, '2021-03-09 20:22:53', '2021-03-10 19:39:23', '/resources/images/woman_food_donut.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/20-ways-to-eat-healthier', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (58, 11, '10 ‘Healthy Eating’ Food Rules You Can Actually Throw Out Immediately', 'Who decided “Don\'t eat after 8 p.m.” made sense, anyway?', '![Mixed race woman holding colorful french cookies](https://media.self.com/photos/6001cbe80ea3ae085f6aa8f6/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/woman_macaron.jpeg)Lucas Ottone/Adobe Stock\n\nArbitrary food rules are ubiquitous in our society, thanks to diet culture and skewed views of what “healthy eating” actually is. These rules often manifest as specific commands and sweeping maxims about what, when, and how we should be eating. \n\nSome of these food rules are well-intentioned suggestions, and can indeed be genuinely helpful—to some people, some of the time—when used as guiding principles, as opposed to hard-and-fast rules. But a lot of food rules are, frankly, total B.S. They\'re unnecessarily restrictive, unrealistic, or unscientific—and, often, potentially bad for your relationship with food.\n\nThe problem is that rules are by definition one-size-fits-all, while we know that healthy eating is anything but. Our different bodies, nutritional needs, tastes, cultures, medical histories, food access, budgets, and lifestyles all factor into the best food choices for any one individual. So it naturally follows that rigid, generic rules about eating aren\'t going to work for everyone.\n\nWith that in mind, we talked to a few R.D.s about the food rules they wish people would realize they can actually toss out—or, at the very least, be a helluva lot more flexible about. We also asked them to explain why, exactly, they think these rules are worth ignoring (besides the fact that rules just suck). Get ready to add some items to your Things IDGAF About list.\n\n## 1. “Avoid processed foods.” \n\n“This rule is incoherent, and not necessarily helpful for making the best food choices,” Marina Chaparro, R.D., M.P.H., certified diabetes educator, founder of Nutrichicos, and author of *Diabetes & Pregnancy: A Real Guide for Women With Type 1, Type 2, and Gestational Diabetes,* tells SELF. There\'s a ton of hubbub in the food world around the word “processed,” but all it *really* means, according to the Food and Drug Administration, is that the food has been combined with at least one other ingredient, or changed in any way from its natural state (for instance: canned, mixed, cut, or pasteurized). So “unless you\'re eating a raw whole food diet where you don\'t cook anything, you are consuming processed foods,” Chaparro explains. That includes nutrient-rich foods like yogurt, whole wheat bread, almond butter, and smoked salmon, she points out. “Instead of avoiding processed foods, I would focus on teaching people how to read a label and not generalizing food as good or bad.” (Thinking about some foods as “good” and others as “bad” is essentially assigning food a moral value, which can make you feel like a bad *person* for eating something that seems “too processed” or otherwise unhealthy.)\n\n## 2. “Shop the perimeter.”\n\nIf you haven\'t heard of this food rule before, here\'s the gist: This grocery shopping principle is meant to steer people toward adding more produce and fresh foods in their diets. Those are typically in the aisles on the perimeter of a store, whereas other items (like packaged snacks and frozen foods) tend to be in the middle. Adding more produce and fresh food to your shopping cart when possible can be great. However, this rule also implores folks to keep packaged and shelf-stable foods out of their carts, Cara Harbstreet, M.S., R.D., L.D. of Street Smart Nutrition, tells SELF. “In reality, this is an unrealistic way to shop and cook for many people, who turn to the convenience, affordability, and flavor of foods found in the inner aisles,” she says.\n\nWhat’s more, “If you only shop the perimeter at the supermarket, you’ll miss out on rice, oats, beans, and so many other nutritious foods,” Marisa Moore, M.B.A., R.D.N., L.D., culinary and integrative dietitian, tells SELF. “Though I get the intent, it is limiting.” It also makes it seem as though frozen fruits and veggies—some of Moore’s favorite time-saving staples, located in the center aisles at her market—are not even worth considering, when the reality is that they\'re packed with nutrients and often more affordable than their fresh counterparts. \n\nThis rule is *especially* unfeasible in the coronavirus era, Harbstreet points out, when many people want or need to limit their trips to the store due to COVID-19. Her advice? “Toss this outdated advice and curate a shopping list based on what you need—packaged and shelf-stable foods included.”\n\n## 3. “Don’t eat after X o’clock.” \n\nSome people stop eating at a certain time because they’ve heard eating before bed is bad for you. But unless eating before bed gives you indigestion, it’s not really inherently worse for your body, as SELF has previously reported. More to the point is the reality that for many of us, our schedules are just not conducive to finishing eating by 6, 7, or 8 p.m. \"Many people are eating dinner very early and going to bed super late, so it is natural to need [food] because your body still needs energy while it is awake,” Dalina Soto M.A., R.D., L.D.N., bilingual dietitian and founder of Nutritiously Yours and Your Latina Nutrition, tells SELF.\n\nOthers implement a cutoff time to thwart their late-night cravings for snacky, “bad” foods. “The interesting thing is, this arbitrary rule might actually be contributing to your late-night cravings,” Vincci Tsui, R.D., anti-diet dietitian and certified intuitive eating counselor, tells SELF. “We all know that the more we tell ourselves that we can\'t have something, the more that we want it, right?” When you give yourself permission to head to the kitchen at any hour, late-night snacks can become less “naughty” and enticing.\n\n## 4. “Don\'t emotionally eat.”  \n\nThe fact is that eating often *is* emotional, Lindsay Birchfield M.S, R.D., L.D., health and body activist and dietitian at Creating Peace With Food and Rooted Heart Health Care. “We eat to celebrate and we eat to mourn,” she says.\n\nEating for emotional comfort is problematized, but in reality it’s a lot like most other coping mechanisms: a tool intended to help you get by, handle stress, and feel better. “[Emotional eating] is simply another way of seeking comfort when needed,” Kimmie Singh, M.S., R.D., founder of The Body Positive Dietitian, tells SELF. “Part of having a healthy relationship with food includes having permission to eat emotionally when it is helpful,” Singh explains, adding, “delicious food can be a great source of pleasure and comfort when experiencing painful emotions.” This is especially topical in the coronavirus pandemic, which has disrupted many people\'s dynamics with food in major ways, including limiting people\'s access to food, triggering disordered eating behaviors, and prompting many to seek comfort in the form of something that tastes good. \nThat said, eating should not be your only coping mechanism. Singh recommends seeking support from a mental health provider if you are struggling to access other tools. Finding a mental health provider who\'s affordable, accessible, and understanding in the way you need can be hard in “regular” times, much less right now. Here\'s some insight into finding the right therapist for you, a few more tips on that very subject, and some tips for having a good teletherapy appointment too. \n\n## 5. “Cook from scratch to eat healthier.”  \n\n“There’s this idea that in order to eat well and to be healthy, everything has to be made from scratch, and it’s just not true,” Moore says. Prepared, premade, and frozen foods can actually make nutritious choices more realistic for people, Veronica E. Garnett, M.S., R.D., Health at Every Size and Fat-Positive registered dietitian and culinarian, tells SELF. Garnett recommends “nutritious and delicious time-savers” like rotisserie chickens, quick rice, salad kits, and microwavable bags of frozen veggies, for instance. “When you feel like it and have the time, definitely make your scratch-made favorites,” Garnett says. “But know that there is absolutely nothing wrong with getting help from the grocery store.” \n\n## 6. “Don’t overdo it on the sugary fruit.”  \n\n“This is such a commonly held belief—that fruits are too high in sugar and must be ‘bad’ for you,” Erica Leon, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N., nutrition therapist, certified eating disorder registered dietitian, and founder of Erica Leon Nutrition, tells SELF. Yes, fruit contains sugar. But it also provides fiber and a variety of essential vitamins and minerals, Leon says—not to mention, juicy flavor. That fiber helps fill you up, while slowing the rate at which your body absorbs the sugar in fruit, Leon explains—which helps to keep blood sugar and energy levels more stable than, say, an equivalent amount of table sugar. Eat the fruit.\n\n## 7. “Drink a glass of water when you\'re hungry.”\n\nThirst calls for hydration; hunger calls for food. “This rule is used to suppress hunger, and while it may keep you temporarily full, the body will eventually figure out that no energy is coming into the body,” certified intuitive eating counselor Carolina Guízar, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N., founder of Eathority and cofounder of Latinx Health Collective, tells SELF. And now you’re *really* hungry. “The longer you delay feeding your body, the hungrier you will be, and it can set you up for eating in a way that feels ‘out of control,’” Guízar explains. What’s more, “This habit has the potential to diminish your body’s trust in you to nourish it regularly.” So by all means, stay hydrated. But when you’re hungry, eat. \n\n## 8. “Always choose the whole grain.”\n\nWhole grains are an awesome thing to include in your diet—generally offering more fiber, protein, and hearty texture than their refined counterparts. But that doesn’t mean we need to condemn refined grains for eternity. “Eating regular pasta or white rice and not the higher fiber alternative doesn’t mean your meal is not ‘healthy,” Yasi Ansari, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D., national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and assistant director of performance nutrition for UC Berkeley Athletics, tells SELF. If you really want the white bread, for instance, how satisfied are you going to feel after eating the whole grain one? Anyhow, what’s more important nutrition-wise is the balance of your meal as a whole. “There are a variety of ways to add more protein, fats, and fiber to your meal to pack in more nutrients,” Ansari explains—think beans, veggies, nuts, dairy, and meat or plant-based protein. \n\n## 9. “Cut your carbs.”\n\nIn the diet industry, macronutrients come in and out of fashion, even though “all of our macronutrients are vital for biological processes,” Birchfield explains. Recently, the influence of diets glorifying fat and demonizing carbs (like keto or paleo) has led to a broadly held assumption that fewer carbs are better, across the board. Not so! “Carbs are great and should be treated just like any other macronutrient,” Ansari says. “They provide us with efficient and easy-to-use fuel that our body needs for both mental and physical performance,” including essential body functions, daily activities, and exercise. Without enough carbohydrates from foods like grains, fruits, starchy veggies, beans, and legumes, “we run the risk of our energy tanking,” Ansari says—making it really hard to be at your best in daily life. And, Ansari adds, carbs often contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals your body really needs.\n\n## 10. \"Always sit down at a table to eat.\"\n\nPrioritizing sitting down and being present enough to really enjoy your meal can help make eating a more pleasant and meaningful experience, Guízar says. But, “While it would be nice for us to always have time to sit down and savor our meals, it is simply unrealistic to do this all the time,” she says. “The reality is that [some] meals will be messy and rushed, and that is okay.” If this sounds like your day-to-day, then don’t hold yourself to a standard that doesn’t fit your lifestyle, or makes you feel bad when you don’t meet it. Standing up at the counter, at your desk between Zooms, on the go as you head into work as an essential employee—”It still counts as a meal,” as Guízar says.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:24:16', '2021-03-10 19:42:45', '/resources/images/woman_macaron.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/food-rules-to-stop-following', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (59, 9, '40 Decluttering Tips For Your Apartment', '', '![img](/resources/images/shutterstock_1093498739.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe all deal with it at some point in our lives. Endless clutter can feel overwhelming, especially in small apartments. Instead of envying your clutter-free friends who seem to have it mastered, use these tips to whip your apartment into shape.\r\n\r\n## The Benefits of Decluttering\r\n\r\nDecluttering may feel like a chore reminiscent of our childhood. However, it comes with its benefits.\r\n\r\nNot only is it easier to clean your apartment when you’re clutter-free, but you’re also less stressed. Suddenly, you can find everything you need and your place feels amazing. Read on for our best tips to get you started!\r\n\r\n## 1. Declutter in Set Periods of Time\r\n\r\nTackling your entire apartment in one day can feel overwhelming. Instead, declutter in set periods. Set yourself a timer and work on one area for 10 or 15 minutes and take a break or call it quits until tomorrow.\r\n\r\n## 2. Regularly Donate Items\r\n\r\nDonating items is a great way to pass on things to those in need. Designate each week with a donation theme, from furniture to bedroom or kitchen. Drop items off or arrange a pickup from Goodwill or your favorite charity.\r\n\r\n## 3. Create a Decluttering Checklist\r\n\r\nInstead of spinning your wheels and jumping from task to task, use adecluttering checklist. Design it around a specific room or area of your apartment and check off your list as you go.\r\n\r\n## 4. Set Goals for Yourself\r\n\r\nGoal-setting can help you to tackle big decluttering projects and feel accomplished at the same time. Set goals based on volume. For example, tell yourself, \"Today, I\'ll fill an entire trash bag of things to donate.\"\r\n\r\n## 5. Manage Your Paperwork\r\n\r\nPaperwork escalates clutter and keeps piling up. Designate a day of the week to shredding and sorting mail and other items.\r\n\r\nTackling paperwork is also a good time to unsubscribe from catalogs, mailing lists, and switch to paperless billing.\r\n\r\n## 6. Stop Treating Your Home like a Storage Unit\r\n\r\nJust because your apartment can store something, doesn\'t mean it should. Clear out the things you don\'t use anymore. Sell it, donate it, and treat your apartment more like home.\r\n\r\n## 7. Take Before and After Photos\r\n\r\nDecluttering can be a long process, and the results aren\'t always visible. Take before and after photos to see your progress and stay motivated by the results of your hard work.\r\n\r\n## 8. Utilize the \"4 Box Method\"\r\n\r\nThe four-box method can help narrow down your clutter and create a system for what to do next. Grab four boxes and label them accordingly:\r\n\r\n- Trash\r\n- Give away\r\n- Keep\r\n- Relocate\r\n\r\nBut remember to follow a simple rule of thumb: If you haven\'t used it in a year, donate it or get rid of it!\r\n\r\n## 9. Ask for Help from Family and Friends\r\n\r\nWe can all use some support in our decluttering and organizational goals. Ask a family member or friend for help and turn it into a party. Listen to music, order pizza, and catch up before trading apartments and tackling someone else\'s clutter.\r\n\r\nYou can also solicit advice from your network over Zoom or FaceTime to ask how to tackle your decluttering goals.\r\n\r\n## 10. Try the \"One In, One Out\" Rule\r\n\r\nStudio apartments and small spaces need ground rules when it comes to bringing in more stuff. Every time you buy something new, commit to donating or getting rid of something else. Now there won’t be an excess of things in your apartment, and you stay in control.\r\n\r\n## 11. Try the 90-Day Rule\r\n\r\nTuck away your seasonal items, and then look at what\'s left behind. If you haven\'t used or worn the item in 90 days, consider donating it or tossing it altogether. Chances are high you\'ll never miss it.\r\n\r\n## 12. View Your Home as a Visitor\r\n\r\nView your home with fresh eyes and think about what a visitor would see first. Go through each room and make a list of what clutter is standing out and how you can resolve it.\r\n\r\n## 13. Get Innovative with Storage Solutions\r\n\r\nEven cozy apartments can benefit from small storage solutions. Hanging baskets for towels and socks can help declutter a closet or dresser.\r\n\r\nA plate display rack showcases your dishes and helps declutter your cabinets. And a pegboard helps you to hang gadgets, utensils, and other items.\r\n\r\n## 14. Rely on Technology\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of ways technology helps reduce your clutter and maximizes your apartment space. Scan old photos and give away or toss photo albums.\r\n\r\nSell off your DVD or CD collection and rely on digital solutions instead. The more you can store on your devices and in the cloud, the less cluttered your physical space will be.\r\n\r\n## 15. Get Multi-Functional\r\n\r\nCozy apartments need all the room they can get. So, keep your furniture multi-functional.\r\n\r\nReduce clutter with a coffee table or ottoman with hidden storage. Then, tuck away magazines, paperwork, and cords to keep them out of sight.\r\n\r\n## 16. Embrace Minimalism\r\n\r\nDecluttering is often about a mindset shift more than getting rid of your stuff. Embrace the idea of minimalism where everything serves a purpose, and you\'re free from cleaning and caring for so much stuff. Reduce the number of things in your apartment and enjoy the freedom it gives your life.\r\n\r\n## 17. Think Small\r\n\r\nOversized furniture isn\'t doing your apartment any favors when it comes to clutter. Reduce your volume of stuff by focusing on smaller pieces. Opt for love seats, smaller chairs, or padded folding chairs to make your living room feel more spacious.\r\n\r\n## 18. Use Your Wall Space\r\n\r\nPut your wall space to work to help you cut the clutter. Hang file folders and file away paperwork and other items. You can also ditch the television altogether and use a digital projector to watch television right on your wall.\r\n\r\n## 19. Reduce Duplicates\r\n\r\nHow many coffee cups, guest towels, and extra blankets do you need in your apartment? Reduce the number of duplicates and ditch the excess.\r\n\r\nKeep enough for you, your roommate, and a few visitors. Give away the rest.\r\n\r\n## 20. Identify Hidden Storage Areas for Clutter\r\n\r\nYour apartment is likely full of hidden storage areas where you can stash your clutter. The tops of your cabinets can store baskets and bins for mail and seasonal items.\r\n\r\nThe space above your bedroom door is also an ideal spot for an extra shelf for linens and towels to free up closet space.\r\n\r\n## 21. Commit to a \"Clean as You Go\" Strategy\r\n\r\nDrowning in clutter often accumulates from bad habits. Adopt a “clean as you go” strategy to wash up dishes, sort your mail, and throw out extra stuff the moment it appears in your apartment.\r\n\r\n## 22. Rent Your Stuff\r\n\r\nWhy buy fancy clothes, shoes, and accessories that you\'ll only wear once or twice a year? Rent them instead. That’ll reduce the items taking up valuable space in your closet.\r\n\r\nYou can also take the same approach with kitchen gadgets, photography equipment, and children\'s toys.\r\n\r\n## 23. Fold It Up\r\n\r\nMany things in your apartment can fold up and be tucked away for clutter control. Donate your kitchen table and attach a folding wall table instead.\r\n\r\nYou can take the same approach with your office space. Add comfortable folding chairs that can store easily and get to work without cluttering up your space.\r\n\r\n## 24. Use More Dividers\r\n\r\nSometimes we have more than enough drawers and cabinets but can\'t find our way through the clutter. Get organized with drawer organizers and dividers to separate the mess and make sense of what you need and what you don\'t.\r\n\r\n## 25. Host a Digital Sale\r\n\r\nSometimes we need a nudge to start a decluttering frenzy, like a financial goal. Host a digital sale and list your furniture, knick-knacks, camera equipment, dishes, and anything else of value on digital platforms.\r\n\r\nFacebook Marketplace, Nextdoor, and OfferUp are websites that can help you to get rid of your stuff and earn some cash at the same time.\r\n\r\n## 26. Hire a Pro\r\n\r\nSometimes, we can\'t get on top of our clutter without a pro to help. Hire a professional organizer to help you create systems and processes for dealing with your stuff. You\'ll walk away with a cleaner apartment and the ability to do it on your own.\r\n\r\n## 27. Designate a Clutter Spot\r\n\r\nIt can feel overwhelming to have no place to set down mail or paperwork you can\'t deal with yet. Designate a spot in your apartment, like a basket or bin by the door, to tuck away your mess.\r\n\r\nThen, pick a day of the week to deal with it. Make it fun by preparing a cocktail or specialty coffee when you deal with the junk to turn it into an event.\r\n\r\n## 28. Tackle the Smallest Projects First\r\n\r\nBig, audacious goals are admirable but are likely to fall flat. Instead of overwhelming yourself by decluttering your entire closet in one day, focus on the smallest project first.\r\n\r\nGain confidence in momentum every time you clear off a laundry room shelf or cabinet. Then, work your way up to the big closet clutter.\r\n\r\n## 29. Quit Shopping for a Month\r\n\r\nYour clutter will dramatically start to disappear if you give up shopping once in a while. Quit shopping for any extras beyond groceries and essential items for a month. You can repeat the process a few times a year and watch as your stuff magically becomes organized.\r\n\r\n## 30. Ditch \"Just in Case\" Stuff\r\n\r\nStop avoiding that box or drawer with all the \"just in case\" stuff. Random cords, hardware, washcloths, and gadgets should be tossed or donated. Your space will suddenly feel carefree again.\r\n\r\n## 31. Organize by Function\r\n\r\nFiguring out what to do with your clutter stops some people in their tracks. Start organizing each area by function.\r\n\r\nDedicate a shelf to toilet paper and paper towels, a drawer to toothpaste and extra toothbrushes, and a closet to linens. Organizing by function also helps you know where everything in your apartment is instead of wasting time searching.\r\n\r\n## 32. Incorporate Organization Into Your Design\r\n\r\nSmall spaces like studio apartments need an organizational boost to tame the clutter. Incorporate clutter control ideas into yoursmall space design. Start by lofting your bed and adding storage bins, bookshelves, or a makeshift closet underneath.\r\n\r\n## 33. Focus on Productivity\r\n\r\nBoredom and restlessness are some of the best times to declutter and getproductive. Whether you\'re dealing with the pandemic or are homebound on a budget, devote the extra time to getting a handle on your stuff.\r\n\r\n## 34. Document the Journey\r\n\r\nSometimes, we need inspiration, support, and accountability to make it through big decluttering goals. Document the journey on social media. Ask friends to share their best tips for keeping their apartments tidy and organized.\r\n\r\n## 35. Clear Out the Pantry\r\n\r\nWe often overlook our pantries when it comes to clearing out the old. Invest in air-tight food containers and get rid of old bags, boxes, and expired items hiding in the back of your pantry. You might even start saving on food when you can see what you have.\r\n\r\n## 36. Hang it Up\r\n\r\nThere\'s a play to hang nearly everything in your apartment. Shoe organizers can declutter bathroom bottles, hairdryers, and curling irons. You can clip boots onto pant hangers in your closet.\r\n\r\nFruit baskets can store food in your kitchen, mail in your hallway, or hand towels in your bathroom.\r\n\r\n## 37. Double Up Your Stuff\r\n\r\nMessy closets are challenging to tackle when there\'s simply nowhere else to hang up your stuff. To reclaim your space, double up and hang heavy coats over jackets. You can also clip two pairs of pants together on the same hanger to save on space.\r\n\r\n## 38. Clear Out Your Corners\r\n\r\nSqueeze out every inch of space you can by maximizing your corners. Clear them out and add shelving and storage designed to fit corners. Then, add bins and baskets to tuck away your unsightly clutter.\r\n\r\n## 39. Reward Yourself\r\n\r\nAll of that decluttering is hard work and deserves a reward once in a while. Once you\'ve cleared out your closet, replace it with a few high-quality wardrobe pieces or a new pair of boots to replace the dozens of items you tossed.\r\n\r\n## 40. Regularly Block off Time to Declutter Your Apartment\r\n\r\nDecluttering isn\'t a one-time event. Embrace it as a recurring event that\'s more like a marathon than a sprint.\r\n\r\nSet yourself a calendar reminder for once a week to tackle the clutter for as little as 30 minutes while listening to music. Then, devote a few times a year to a massive overhaul, likespring cleaning or a holiday purge.\r\n\r\n#### Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nDecluttering is more than just getting rid of stuff and staying organized. It\'s an incredible feeling to have more control over your apartment and feel more at home in your space.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:24:32', '2021-03-10 19:44:55', '/resources/images/shutterstock_1093498739.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/decluttering-tips', 0, 0);

Not only can this knowledge help you avoid them in the future, but it can also help you get to the root of your infestation problem. \r\n\r\nThese are two of the most common ways renters attract roaches. \r\n\r\n#### Food\r\n\r\nHome pests such as cockroaches need food to survive. Typically, roaches will be attracted to food in homes. \r\n\r\nThat’s not to say that you can’t keep food in the apartment. Of course you can! \r\n\r\nIt’s *how* you store food that can be a problem. If you leave food out for a long enough time, it will attract cockroaches (and potentially other pests). \r\n\r\nAnything from crumbs littering cabinet shelves to dishes left on the counter can act as a beacon for roaches. Food storage should be centralized in the kitchen, meaning that even if you eat a meal in another area of the unit, dirty dishes and leftovers should be promptly stored away and cleaned up. \r\n\r\n#### Dirty Dishes\r\n\r\nDirty dishes can also attract roaches. A few dishes left in the sink overnight won’t necessarily cause an infestation. \r\n\r\nHowever, a kitchen sink that is perpetually full of dishes with leftover remnants of food will certainly attract roaches. These dishes will inadvertently act as the consistent source of food that roaches need to thrive. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that dishes or food packaging such as pizza boxes or takeout containers left strewn about an apartment will attract roaches. Failing to maintain a clean and hygienic apartment will result in an infestation. Pests need food, water, and lots of places to hide. \r\n\r\n## Signs You Have Cockroaches?\r\n\r\nIf you want to act promptly and effectively bring an infestation to a stop, then it’s imperative that you know how to recognize the signs of a cockroach infestation. You can keep an eye out for any of these clues. They’ll help you stay one step ahead of your pests and get them out fast. \r\n\r\nHere are some signs that indicate you’re dealing with a cockroach infestation. \r\n\r\n#### 1. You See a Cockroach — Dead or Alive\r\n\r\nCockroaches are nocturnal insects. They often hide out during the day in dark, moist places. \r\n\r\nOften, they’ll invade the kitchen or other area at night when the lights are out. Turning on the light will cause these creatures to scatter quickly, hence the well-known phrase “scatter like roaches.” \r\n\r\nThat said, if you see a roach during the day, it’s a sure sign that you’re dealing with an infestation. This goes for all roaches, dead, alive, or unhatched. Roaches leave their unhatched eggs laying about. If you notice any brown pill-shapedcockroach eggs lying around, you may have an infestation. \r\n\r\n#### 2. You Notice Roach Droppings\r\n\r\nRoaches, like all pests, leave their droppings in conspicuous places. These tiny dark brown droppings will likely be left in clusters. However, even seeing a single dropping is a cause for concern. Be sure to deeply sanitize any area that you notice the droppings in. \r\n\r\n#### 3. Roaches Bring in a Musty Smell\r\n\r\nRoaches are also known for the distinctly musty smell they carry with them. You may notice a musty oily smell that you cannot find the source of, even after performing a deep clean. This scent will grow stronger as the infestation grows. If you have noticed this smell for a while, then it’s likely you have a significant infestation on your hands. \r\n\r\n## Getting Rid of Roaches\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve become aware of an infestation, you should act quickly to help ensure that it doesn’t continue to fester and spread. Here’s how to get rid of roaches in your apartment.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Store-Bought Traps\r\n\r\nThe first step to getting rid of cockroaches is to buy store-bought traps that are designed to attract and then kill cockroaches. Some of these traps work by poisoning food that the roach will then bring back to the other roaches. Others are simple sticky traps. \r\n\r\nOnce you’ve put these traps out on the first night, be sure to check them the next morning. If you notice that there are a ton of cockroaches on a single trap, then it may be a sign of a large infestation. \r\n\r\n#### 2. Homemade Traps\r\n\r\nIf you don’t want to make a trip to the store to purchase traps, don’t worry — making homemade traps can be just as effective. Here are some homemade trap options:\r\n\r\n- **Jar Traps:** These traps work to drown roaches as they approach the bait left at the bottom of the bottle or jar. You can utilize any sweet or fatty liquid as bait, but beer and wine are most frequently recommended. \r\n- **Duct Tape Traps**: Using a common household item, duct tape, these traps ensnare roaches on the sticky side of the duct tape. \r\n\r\n#### 3. Give Your Apartment a Deep-Cleaning\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most important steps as it can help you uncover your roaches’ primary hiding spots and help to eliminate their food sources. \r\n\r\nBe sure to deep clean with products that are proven to sanitize and disinfect. Roaches are disease carriers and can make you sick! Start in the kitchen and work your way through the rest of the apartment. \r\n\r\n#### 4. Exterminators\r\n\r\nAn exterminator should always be called in cases of a cockroach infestation. It’s impossible to ensure that you’ve driven them all out, even if you’ve carried out all the steps we listed above. \r\n\r\nThese professionals will use their tools and industrial-grade repellents and poisons to completely eliminate the problem. Be sure to contact your landlord before calling. That’s because they may require other tenants to leave the premises for an extended period. \r\n\r\n## How to Prevent Cockroaches\r\n\r\nIt’s always better to be proactive as opposed to reactive. Here’s how to prevent cockroaches in your apartment. \r\n\r\n#### 1. Clean the Apartment Regularly\r\n\r\nKeeping your apartment clean is one of the most effective ways to prevent cockroaches. This method removes their source of food and reduces the chances of them making their way into your home. Be sure to:\r\n\r\n- Vacuum All Areas\r\n- Wash the Dishes\r\n- Sweep Up Crumbs on Floor\r\n- Clean Out Cabinets\r\n- Ensure all Food is Stored and Sealed Properly\r\n\r\n#### 2. Seal Any Cracks in Walls or Flooring and Leaks\r\n\r\nCockroaches are known to get in through even the smallest of openings, so preventing them means removing any and all of their entrances and exits. \r\n\r\nAsk your landlord or property manager to look for any cracks throughout your unit (and the property as a whole). They should seal any holes or cracks to prevent future infestations. \r\n\r\n#### 3. Make Sure Windows are Properly Sealed\r\n\r\nSealing windows works to eliminate any entrances that cockroaches may have to your apartment. However, as roaches have the ability to fit through holes that are extremely small, it’s imperative to ensure that your windows are professionally sealed. \r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nCockroaches are not only a gross nuisance, but they can also pose a significant threat to your health. That’s why it’s important to maintain a clean apartment at all times and take preventative steps to significantly reduce your chances of infestation. \r\n\r\nIf you’re besieged by a roach infestation, talk to your landlord or property manager. They can help you get rid of the infestation and help prevent another one.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:25:56', '2021-03-10 19:45:34', '/resources/images/images_jeshoots-com-__ZMnefoI3k-unsplash-1024x683.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/get-rid-of-cockroaches', 0, 0);

However, bathroom germs and bacteria are everywhere. They include enteric pathogens, gastrointestinal viruses, fungi, and all the things you never want to think about again.\r\n\r\nReady to learn how to clean a bathroom? It\'s time to throw open the windows, air out the bathroom, and get to work with a serious scrubbing.\r\n\r\n-How to Clean a Bathroom: Supplies You’ll Need\r\n-How Often Should You Clean a Bathroom?\r\n-13 Steps to Cleaning Your Bathroom\r\n-Final Thoughts\r\n\r\n## How to Clean a Bathroom: Supplies You\'ll Need\r\n\r\n- Sponges and scrubbers\r\n- Paper towels or rags\r\n- Trash bags\r\n- Mop\r\n- Grout cleaner\r\n- Toilet brush and toilet bowl cleaner\r\n- Toilet bowl drop-in cleaner tablets\r\n- Air freshener\r\n\r\nIf you want to give your home a top-to-bottom cleaning, try using ourhousehold cleaning checklist in addition to these tips.\r\n\r\n## How Often Should You Clean a Bathroom?\r\n\r\nTackling how to clean your bathroom also requires a schedule. Most areas like your shower and sink need a once-a-week cleaning. \r\n\r\nHowever, you should wipe down a toilet that multiple people use every few days or more. Make a cleaning schedule with your roommate and switch off as needed. \r\n\r\nMake throwing out bathroom supplies and must-haves part of your cleaning routine, as well. Here’s how often you shouldreplace bathroom essentials like shower curtains and bath mats. \r\n\r\n## 13 Steps to Cleaning Your Bathroom\r\n\r\n#### 1. Scrub the Shower\r\n\r\nLove shower gels, fancy soaps, and shaving products lining your shower shelves? Remove all objects in the shower to reach all the surfaces. \r\n\r\nUse a mildew-fighting shower spray. Then, start scrubbing at mold, grime, and soap scum. \r\n\r\nIs your shower curtain full of mold and mildew? If you can’t scrub it clean, throw it out and get a fresh one every few months. \r\n\r\n#### 2. Clean the Walls\r\n\r\nTiles and grout attractbathroom mold with unsightly black spots. Your bathroom cleaner with a mildew fighter can help. \r\n\r\nOr, you can try one part bleach and two parts water. Then, scrub it into your tile and let it sit for 30 minutes. \r\n\r\nSkip the bleach solution if you have colored grout in your bathroom that could fade. Instead, scrub with a mold and mildew-fighting bathroom cleaner. Touch up cracked, faded, or damaged grout. \r\n\r\n#### 3. Clean the Ceiling\r\n\r\nRemove cobwebs and anything else lingering in the corners of your ceiling. Carefully clean black mold with 1/4 cup of white vinegar, two cups of hot water, and two or three tablespoons of borax. Be careful not to get the solution in your eyes. \r\n\r\nYou should report stubborn black mold to your landlord to avoid its spread and health problems. Black mold can cause breathing and respiratory problems for you, your roommates, and your guests. \r\n\r\n#### 4. Mop or Swiffer the Floor\r\n\r\nGrab your mop or Swiffer and attack your floors with a vengeance. Scrub the corners, look for mold, and throw your bath mat into the washing machine. Wipe down your baseboards and look for anything you missed.\r\n\r\nTake a moment to note any holes or damage around your baseboards. Household pests could use them as an entryway and spread to the rest of your apartment. Report them to your landlord to get on top of the problem quickly.\r\n\r\n#### 5. Clean the Sink and Vanity Area\r\n\r\nBacteria and grime can build up in your bathroom sink and create a health hazard. Give your sink a good scrubbing with a sponge to avoid scratching a porcelain or delicate surface. \r\n\r\nUse a bathroom cleaner to wipe down the rest of the vanity. Wipe out all drawers and cabinets around your sink.\r\n\r\nWhat’s going on above your sink? Wipe down your mirror and pay attention to the edges.\r\n\r\n#### 6. Clean the Toilet\r\n\r\nIt’s that moment you’ve been dreading! Get to work disinfecting your toilet with a toilet brush and toilet bowl cleaner. Work on all of the parts you hope you never have to touch again. \r\n\r\nAdd a drop-in toilet bowl cleaner once it’s clean. Only use an appropriate cleaner. Avoid flushing bleach or other chemicals down the toilet. \r\n\r\nClean all areas of your toilet, including the top, bottom, and the outside of the bowl. You can always wear gloves if this job grosses you out. \r\n\r\n#### 7. Wash All Bath and Hand Towels\r\n\r\nGather up your bath towels and hand towels and throw them in the washing machine. Give them a thorough washing and heat dry if possible to kill off germs. \r\n\r\nGot old towels with holes or other damage? Consider donating old towels or throwing them out and starting anew. \r\n\r\n#### 8. Dust Surfaces and Sweep or Vacuum the Floors\r\n\r\nBathrooms collect a surprising amount of dust. Dust your linen closet shelves, drawers, or other surfaces. \r\n\r\nSweep and vacuum carpeted bathrooms. Use a carpet cleaning product to touch up any stains or problem spots.\r\n\r\n#### 9. Wash the Windows\r\n\r\nGrab some glass cleaner and work on washing down your windows. Use a streak-free cleaner for the best results. Wipe dust and grime from the window sills and frames.\r\n\r\n#### 10. Disinfect the Door Knobs \r\n\r\nEver wonder what’s growing on your door knobs? Disinfect them with an appropriate cleaner. You can use a solution of vinegar and water to help remove germs.\r\n\r\n#### 11. Throw Out Old Medicine \r\n\r\nWhat’s hanging out in your medicine cabinet? You should throw old, expired medicine out. You can usually toss over-the-counter medication out in a Ziploc bag. \r\n\r\nPrescription medication needs a safe disposal method. Check theDiversion Control Division website to find a safe way to dispose of controlled substances.\r\n\r\n#### 12. Take Out the Bathroom Trash \r\n\r\nGather up your bathroom trash and dispose of it. Clean out your bathroom trash can or replace it with a new can. Add a clean trash bag that’s built for spills. \r\n\r\nAdd a can for recycling if you toss numerous shampoo bottles and other products regularly.\r\n\r\n#### 13. Deodorize with Bathroom Spray\r\n\r\nYou’re almost done! Deodorize your sparkling clean bathroom with household eliminator spray. Keep the door and windows open for a while to help circulate the scent and any residual cleaning smell.\r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nCongratulations on conquering how to clean a bathroom! Make a thorough scrubbing a regular event. And don’t be embarrassed if your squeaky clean bathroom is now your favorite room in the house.

I know, I know, we all do the basics: washing our sheets, taking out the trash, and scrubbing the toilet. But what do most people forget about? What items around your home haven’t been cleaned in years and are carrying unwanted germs? \r\n\r\nApartment List surveyed over 500 people to discover what household items are the most overlooked when it comes to routine cleanings. When viewing these survey results, please reference the following:\r\n\r\n**\'Most cleaned’** = % of respondents that last cleaned this item within the past few months.\r\n\r\n**‘Least cleaned’** = % of respondents that last cleaned this item a few years ago or never.\r\n\r\n![bathroom vanity](/resources/images/shutterstock_1141261541-1-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Bathroom\r\n\r\nOverall (and perhaps thankfully), respondents reported the bathroom is the most cleaned room in their home. When it comes to the most cleaned items *in* the bathroom, the bath mat tops the list. 89% of respondents cited the bath mat as their ‘most cleaned’ item (cleaned in the past month or few months). The bath mat is followed by the toothbrush holder and hair comb, with 85% and 84% of respondents reporting these items as ‘most cleaned’, respectively.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum, the least cleaned item in the bathroom is the scale. In fact, 28% of people haven’t cleaned their scale in the past year. Assuming the scale is a frequently used item for most, it’s important to give it a good clean.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to “most touched” surfaces, the bathroom door handle was the 3rd ‘least cleaned’ item for renters. In fact, 17% of respondents reported they have not cleaned it within the past few years or *never.*\r\n\r\nCleaning and disinfecting “most touched” surfaces such as door handles is essential for preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. So make sure you’re adding the bathroom door to your usual, and perhaps, in light of current events, daily cleaning routine.\r\n\r\n![img](/resources/images/shutterstock_416796661-1024x609.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Kitchen\r\n\r\nLet’s head to the kitchen, where the stovetop takes the crown for the ‘most cleaned’ item. 95% of respondents cited they have cleaned their stovetop in the past month or a few months ago. The stovetop is followed by the stove knobs and fridge handle with 87% and 85% of respondents, respectively, citing they have cleaned these items in the past few months *at least*.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the ‘least cleaned\' items in the kitchen, the ice maker tops the list. 28% of survey respondents cite they have *never* cleaned their ice maker. The fridge ice dispenser is one of thegermiest things in the kitchen, so make sure to get it cleaned stat. If not cleaned properly, ice makers canbecome contaminated with mold, salmonella, E. coli, and shigella. \r\n\r\nRemember friends, just because its only water in there does not mean the ice maker will avoid getting contaminated! To avoid getting you or your family sick, make sure to thoroughly clean the inside and outside of your ice maker on a routine basis.\r\n\r\n![Living room](/resources/images/nathan-fertig-FBXuXp57eM0-unsplash-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Living Room\r\n\r\nLet’s take a gander into the living room, the space we spend most of our time on the couch, hanging with friends and family. Well here’s some good news, ‘under the couches’ is the most cleaned item in the living room. In fact, 79% of respondents cited they have cleaned under the couches in the past month or a few months ago. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many people are neglecting cleaning their living rooms. 26% of respondents haven’t cleaned their TV remotes recently, yuck! The TV remote is another “most touched” surface and requires frequent cleanings.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the least cleaned item, the TV back panel is most neglected. 28% of respondents cited they haven’t cleaned their TV back panel recently or never have. It’s definitely overlooked, but could be quietly collecting germs. Get it cleaned!\r\n\r\n![Bedroom](/resources/images/logan-nolin-EvceCyopkKI-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Bedroom\r\n\r\nAll this talk of cleaning making you feel a little sleepy? Understandable… but first let’s investigate the cleaning routines of our favorite place: the bedroom. \r\n\r\nBed sheets take the top spot for the ‘most cleaned’ item, with 98% of respondents citing they’ve cleaned their sheets in the past month or a few months ago. I’m sure your significant other will be glad to hear that!\r\n\r\nThe ‘least cleaned’ items in the bedroom are the laundry basket and mattress with around 30% of respondents (32% and 30%, respectively) citing they rarely or *never* clean these items. You may be asking yourself, how exactly do you clean a mattress? Thisstep-by-step guide will walk you through the process.\r\n\r\n![img](/resources/images/shutterstock_1256513359-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Pet Items\r\n\r\nWoof, woof! Let’s not forget about our furry friends. Pet items need a good cleaning, too! \r\n\r\nThe pet bowl is the ‘most cleaned’ item, with 90% of respondents citing they have cleaned their pets’ bowl in the past month or so. Since the pet bowl is where your pet gets *most* of its meals (hey, we don’t judge for those occasional dinner scraps), frequent cleanings are a must. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it appears pet owners are not as diligent when it comes to *pet toys.* 31% of respondents say they have *never* cleaned their pets toys, yuck. Pet toys are constantly in your pet’s mouth or thrown around the house, so make sure to stick to frequent cleanings to prevent you or your pet from getting sick!\r\n\r\n## General Household Items\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to miscellaneous household items, the ceiling fan is the ‘most cleaned’ item. 71% of respondents cited that they clean the ceiling fan at *least* once every few months. Light switches and washing machines are also frequently cleaned. \r\n\r\nThe survey found light bulbs are the ‘least cleaned’ miscellaneous household item. 35% of respondents reported they *never* clean their light bulbs. Cleaning your light bulbs may seem tedious but improves the longevity of your bulb. In fact, dirty light bulbs shine 30%less bright than clean ones. So stop with the unnecessary replacements and get cleaning!\r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nAs we all try our best to understand and combat the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important to take a step back and rethink our daily habits. Developing a thorough, frequentcleaning anddisinfecting routine can help stop the virus from entering your front door. \r\n\r\nMaybe you turn cleaning into a new game with your roommates while ‘WFH’ (working from home), or kids while they’re home from school. Say, the first one to finish a room gets to pick tonight’s Netflix movie or take-out restaurant! We’ve heard some places are even servingadult beverages to-go...\r\n\r\nAbove all, it’s important to stay safe. But let’s have some fun with it!

But how do you know you\'re disinfecting properly and doing your part to stop novel coronavirus in its tracks?\r\n\r\n-The Difference Between Cleaning and Disinfecting\r\n-Disinfectant Products\r\n-Disinfecting Your Kitchen\r\n-Disinfecting Your Bathroom\r\n-Disinfecting Your Phone and Devices\r\n-Final Thoughts\r\n\r\n## The Difference Between Cleaning and Disinfecting\r\n\r\nThere\'s a difference between just cleaning your apartment and disinfecting it. TheCDC advises that cleaning is just the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities covering a service. \r\n\r\nCleaning your countertops may make them look sparkling clean and may help reduce the risk of spreading infection. However, it doesn\'t kill germs. \r\n\r\nDisinfecting uses chemicals to kill surface germs. However, it doesn\'t necessarily clean dirt or remove viruses. Instead, disinfecting should be used after cleaning to reduce spreading novel coronavirus and other germs.\r\n\r\nCleaning and disinfecting your apartment right now is crucial to staying healthy and stopping the spread of COVID-19.Research shows that novel coronavirus may remain viable for hours or days on surfaces. \r\n\r\nThe good news is, proper cleaning can help prevent COVID-19 and other viruses to keep ourselves healthy. \r\n\r\nStart your disinfecting mission by focusing on frequently-touched surfaces. Those are breeding grounds for the virus.\r\n\r\n## Disinfectant Products\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 is considered an enveloped virus, like SARS-CV-2. It relies on a protective lipid coating. \r\n\r\nYou can deactivate that coating with the right cleaners. Novel coronavirus is also easier to break down than many gastrointestinal viruses like norovirus.\r\n\r\nFortunately, common household products can help kill off COVID-19 and keep it from spreading. Disinfectant sprays, wipes, and bleach all make the list, but with a few caveats. Not all wipes can kill novel coronavirus. Also, many supplies are in short supply on grocery store shelves. \r\n\r\nThe EPA provides a list ofapproved COVID-19 disinfectants, but it does take some cross-referencing to ensure the active ingredients are listed. \r\n\r\nYou can also reference thiscleaning list to help determine novel coronavirus killers like Clorox Disinfecting Bathroom Cleaner and Lysol Brand Bleach Multi-purpose Cleaner.\r\n\r\n#### Homemade Disinfectants\r\n\r\nWhat if you can\'t find any of the products on the shelves? The CDC has a backup solution that most people already have at home or can easily find. Mix up a quarter-cup of household chlorine bleach with one gallon of cool water. Then, let it sit for twenty or thirty minutes on surfaces before drying it and wiping it away.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the stand-by bleach trick works well, it\'s not appropriate for every surface or room in your apartment. \r\n\r\nDon’t miss a spot! Use ourcleaning checklist to tackle your apartment from top to bottom.\r\n\r\n![apartment kitchen](/resources/images/shutterstock_1105740260-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Disinfecting Your Kitchen\r\n\r\nYour kitchen can be a hotbed of all kinds of germs. Here\'s where to start disinfecting:\r\n\r\n- Countertops \r\n- Anything with handles, including oven, cabinet knobs, and the sink\r\n- Cutting boards\r\n- Floors\r\n- Refrigerator shelves\r\n\r\nKitchen spills are common and not an emergency. However, you should clean them up immediately. Otherwise, the spill could further spread viruses and contaminate other parts of your kitchen. \r\n\r\nThe same thing goes for your dishes. Clean them immediately. Then, check to see if your dishwasher comes with a sanitized and heat setting. The more you can kill off germs, the better. \r\n\r\nIt\'s impossible to know what\'s festering on your kitchen hand towels. If they\'re old, go ahead and replace them by sealing them in a Ziploc bag and throwing them away. Otherwise, regularly wash them on high heat and dry them thoroughly. \r\n\r\nThe disinfectant journey doesn\'t end with the last paper towel tossed into the trash can. Take out your trash immediately and wash your hands. Then, clean out the bin, place a new trash bag inside, and rewash your hands. \r\n\r\nThe more you can mitigate the risk of spreading germs, the better.\r\n\r\n![bathroom vanity](/resources/images/shutterstock_1141261541-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Disinfecting Your Bathroom\r\n\r\nYour bathroom is the next place for thorough cleaning and disinfecting. Tackle your sink, and make sure to disinfect the fixtures and drain thoroughly. Remember to clean the areas around your sinks like the vanity, mirror, and shelves. \r\n\r\nGive your toilet a good scrub. Pay close attention to under the seat, around the rim, and the handle. Remember to clean the toilet handle with a disinfectant wipe regularly. Then move onto:\r\n\r\n- Shower and shower doors if you have them\r\n- Throw your bath mat and towels into the washing machine\r\n- Floors\r\n- Take out the trash and clean and disinfect your bin\r\n- Doorknob\r\n\r\n## Disinfecting Your Phone and Devices\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to your devices, bleach is not your friend. Clorox wipes work well to disinfect your phone. Apple recommends using a 70 percent isopropyl alcohol wipe todisinfect an iPhone and other devices. \r\n\r\nBefore you get started, turn off your phone and other devices and unplug them. Remove your novelty case or other covering to disinfect that too. \r\n\r\nA thorough job is always the goal. However, be careful not to get cleaner or moisture into your device ports. Dry clean those areas with a smooth microfiber cloth that often comes with eyeglasses.\r\n\r\n#### Other Things to Disinfect\r\n\r\nOnce you start disinfecting, you realize how many things you touch all day in your apartment. Take inventory of what you\'re touching all day, including:\r\n\r\n- TV Remote\r\n- Light switches\r\n- Door handles\r\n- All furniture handles\r\n- Keyboard, computer mouse, and laptop keys\r\n\r\nRemember to also clean your own clothes, bedding, throws, and blankets. Check the care instructions and place them in the washing machine. \r\n\r\nIf you can\'t wash them on your own, try to seal them in a bag away from your other belongings. That’ll help you avoid the spread of germs and viruses. Quarantining your own things and waiting for the virus to die over several days is better than doing nothing. \r\n\r\nResearch shows that viruses like COVID-19 are viable for 2 or 3 days. However, we\'re still learning something new about it every day. It\'s best to assume anything you seal off is likely infected for a week or more.\r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nRemember that all pandemics have come to an end and viruses do die. However, viruses of all kinds still circulate with ebbs and flows, making it important to clean and disinfect on a regular basis. When in doubt, clean, disinfect, and repeat your way through any health crisis.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:27:23', '2021-03-10 20:02:37', '/resources/images/images_shutterstock_215726422-1024x680.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/disinfect-your-apartment', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (64, 9, '10 Germiest Things in Your Kitchen You (Probably) Forget to Clean', '', '![img](/resources/images/images_shutterstock_793913143-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf you think your apartment is already clean, you\'re probably overlooking a few things. Fortunately,The NSF International Household Germ Study is here to remind us just how much we haven\'t cleaned — and the consequences. \r\n\r\nDid you know that studies show more than 20% of foodborne illness outbreaks result from food that was consumed in the home? Also, hidden germs and grime look gross scattered across your kitchen. With the spread of Coronavirus, now seems like the perfect time to start sanitizing.\r\n\r\nRoll up your sleeves and get out your cleaning supplies. Below are the 10 of the germiest things in your kitchen.\r\n\r\n![kitchen cleaning tools](/resources/images/shutterstock_1154531851-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## 1. Fridge Water Dispenser \r\n\r\nThe NSF study says that yeast and mold thrive in areas like our water dispensers. Wipe down the visible surfaces with a clean sponge soaked in vinegar and water. You can also spray the mixture directly into the dispenser.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re confident about what you\'re doing, you can also take apart the water dispenser. Then, disinfect it from the inside out.\r\n\r\n## 2. Rubber Spatula\r\n\r\nWe hate to break it to you, but E. coli lives among us. Reach for those unexpecting rubber spatulas and get to work, giving them a good scrub. \r\n\r\nRinse them in hot water with a few tablespoons of chlorine per gallon of water. Vinegar and water will also work in a pinch. \r\n\r\nBut your rubber spatulas might be a lost cause. If they\'re still sticky after cleaning, throw them out. The synthetic or natural materials are often broken down by hot oils from your last apartment party.\r\n\r\n![Blender](/resources/images/shutterstock_419869516.jpg)\r\n\r\n## 3. Blender\r\n\r\nMixing up cocktails and smoothies in the blender is a perfect way to kick off the weekend. But you might also be adding a few extra ingredients like E. coli, Salmonella, yeast, and mold into your beverages.\r\n\r\nScrub out your blender with dish soap and hot water. Then, fill it with hot water and blend to get down into the gasket. \r\n\r\nIf possible, remove the gasket from the blender. Then, dilute vinegar and water for a thorough cleaning. \r\n\r\n## 4. Fridge Vegetable Compartment\r\n\r\nAre you using your fridge vegetable compartment as a compost bin? Although you cancompost in an apartment, the veggie drawer isn\'t the place to store it. You\'re probably growing Salmonella, Listeria, yeast, and mold alongside your veggies.\r\n\r\nTheCDC recommends throwing out old food and emptying your drawers. Then, scrub them down with hot, soapy water. A solution of one tablespoon of liquid bleach and a gallon of water can also help sanitize your refrigerator.\r\n\r\n## 5. Fridge Ice Dispenser\r\n\r\nDid you know ice dispensers can aggravate your allergies? The ice dispenser is a culprit for yeast and mold. That can make allergy sufferers sick. \r\n\r\nRemove and dump out your ice. Then, get to work with four cups of distilled vinegar and water into the ice maker and dispenser lines. \r\n\r\nAfter a five or ten minute soak, rinse, and repeat. The process can help break down yeast, mold, and lime that\'s building up a hidden germ factory.\r\n\r\n## 6. Fridge Meat Compartment\r\n\r\nMeatless Mondays may be the healthiest night of your week. Leaky meat containers and forgotten food are a recipe for E. coli and Salmonella.\r\n\r\nRemove your drawer, throw out the old meat, mix up a solution of one part vinegar and two parts water, and get to work. Remember to also scrub down any shelves where meat may have sat for even a few minutes. \r\n\r\n![Knife block](/resources/images/shutterstock_733997086-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## 7. Knife Block\r\n\r\nGetting your first knife block is a sign of serious adulting. However, it can also make you sick. Soap, water, and a mild bleach solution of a tablespoon of bleach to every gallon of water can help. \r\n\r\nAnd if you\'re in the market for a new knife block, opt for a product that doesn\'t involve wood slots. They\'re likely holding onto bacteria and other unwelcome guests. \r\n\r\n## 8. Food Storage Containers\r\n\r\nFood storage is key to a clean kitchen. It can make us feel like we\'re winning at the organized fridge game. But those food storage containers with rubber seals also lock in Salmonella, yeast, and mold. \r\n\r\nA vinegar and water solution can help, but you may need new food storage containers.NSF certified products and systems can help solve your food storage problems. \r\n\r\n## 9. Can Opener\r\n\r\nTake a closer look at your can opener before you pop open that next can of beans. Tiny food particles can get caught in the blade. That turns your can opener into a germ factory. \r\n\r\nYou can scrub down handheld can openers with a toothbrush and dishwashing detergent to get the grooves clean. If possible, remove the blade from an electric can opener. Then, use a toothbrush dipped in vinegar to clean out the residue. \r\n\r\nMake sure to dry your can opener to prevent rust. Also, be careful not to cut yourself on the blades.\r\n\r\n## 10. Fridge-Insulating Seal\r\n\r\nThere\'s a germ party going on in your fridge insulating seal. E. coli, Salmonella, yeast, and listeria may all be lingering around your fridge insulating seal.\r\n\r\nThe often-forgotten fridge-insulating seal takes some creativity to clean. Mix a half-teaspoon of dishwashing detergent in a cup of warm water. Then, scrub with a rag or soft toothbrush. \r\n\r\nTreat mold on the seal with a solution of chlorine bleach and warm water. \r\n\r\nWhether you\'re inspired or thoroughly disgusted, it\'s time to clean those forgotten, germiest things in your kitchen. Your place will never feel so clean. You\'ll get a good night\'s rest knowing you\'re germ-free.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:28:14', '2021-03-10 20:03:14', '/resources/images/images_shutterstock_793913143-1024x683.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/germiest-things-in-kitchen', 0, 0);

That’s especially the case if you live in a large building. \r\n\r\nChances are, you’ll need to be home for a furniture pick up. However, you can coordinate with neighbors if you’re not available. \r\n\r\n#### 2. Donate Quality Furniture\r\n\r\nDonated furniture typically needs to be in decent shape. It’ll need to be free of stains, rips, and other damage. It’s wise to let the charity know about the condition of your furniture donation before they come. That way, you can make sure it’s acceptable.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Write Off Your Furniture Donation\r\n\r\nYou can write off a furniture donation on your taxes. Ask the charity about a tax receipt or other paperwork to use for tax time. That can help you to keep more money in your pocket.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Give Stuff Away For Free\r\n\r\nStill can’t find a charity that will accept your furniture donation? Try a site likeFreecycle. \r\n\r\nThis grassroots nonprofit helps people give away their stuff for free to help divert reusable goods from landfills. Freecycle is also a fantastic way todeclutter your apartment and give away stuff charities won’t typically take. That includes items ranging fromcompost to fabric scraps.\r\n\r\n#### 5. Pay it Forward\r\n\r\nWhen you schedule a furniture donation pick up, everyone wins.

That telltale black mold in the bathroom inevitably greets us all. It\'s tempting to ignore it and hope it goes away. However, the best line of defense with black mold in the bathroom is cleaning it and trying to prevent it.\r\n\r\nReady to roll up your sleeves and get rid of mold in the bathroom? Here\'s what to know.\r\n\r\n-How Does Bathroom Mold Grow?\r\n-How to Spot Mold in Bathrooms\r\n-How to Tell if it\'s Black Mold or Mildew\r\n-How to Clean Bathroom Mold\r\n-Dangers of Black Mold\r\n\r\n## How Does Bathroom Mold Grow?\r\n\r\nBathrooms are a prime breeding ground for mold to grow and thrive. It\'s easy for moisture to get trapped in your bathroom and hang around after a hot shower. The small space and lack of ventilation in a bathroom can also cause bathroom mold to show up and linger. \r\n\r\nLeaky toilets, sinks, and cellulose materials like wallpaper can also encourage mold in bathrooms to grow. Sometimes you can do everything possible and still find black mold in the bathroom that won\'t go away. \r\n\r\n## How to Spot Mold in Bathrooms\r\n\r\nBlack mold in a bathroom isn\'t always easy to see. Check under: \r\n\r\n- Your sink vanity\r\n- Around the toilet \r\n- The shower doors \r\n- The ventilation fan\r\n\r\nMold on the bathroom ceiling is also easy to miss. Get on a ladder and look behind the tops of your blinds and curtains. Also, check your light fixtures.\r\n\r\nIt can be tempting to just paint over mold on the bathroom ceiling. However, black mold is stubborn. It’s likely to grow back or grow through your paint.\r\n\r\n## How to Tell if it\'s Black Mold or Mildew\r\n\r\nPeople often confuse mildew for black mold in the bathroom. However, there are some key differences. \r\n\r\nMildew is usually white, gray, or yellow. It’s soft and powdery to the touch. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, black mold in the bathroom is often green or black. It starts growing beneath moist surfaces and can look fuzzy. \r\n\r\nYou might also find bathroom mold is slimy to the touch. That’ll promptly gross you out.\r\n\r\nBlack mold and mildew are both unsightly. You can clean either one the same way. However, the mold in the bathroom is often more problematic. It can cause health issues.\r\n\r\n## How to Clean Bathroom Mold\r\n\r\nThere are a few different ways to clean bathroom mold. The important thing is to remove the black mold and clean your bathroom. However, you need to approach it correctly. Otherwise, you could end up ruining your walls. \r\n\r\nBefore you get started,take a few photos of the issue. Remember to snap a few photos of the mold on the ceiling. This way, you can easily monitor the black mold and have documentation for your landlord. \r\n\r\n#### Cleaning Mold Off of Tiled Walls\r\n\r\nThrow open the windows, turn on the ventilation fan, and wear a face mask. It\'s time to break out the bleach. \r\n\r\nAdd one part bleach and two parts water. Next, scrub down any tiled walls that do not have colored grout. You could cause the grout pigment to fade. \r\n\r\nUse a hard brush to work your bleach solution into the tile. Then, rinse it thoroughly after 30 minutes. \r\n\r\nYou can skip the bleach solution and opt for a bathroom cleaner with mold and mildew remover. Just don\'t flush bleach down the toilet. That could cause a dangerous chemical reaction.\r\n\r\nBleach can produce an overwhelming odor and be challenging to manage. Instead, you can also use a one-part vinegar, two-part water solution. \r\n\r\nSpray that directly onto the mold. Then, let it sit for 30 minutes before scrubbing with a hard brush. \r\n\r\n#### Cleaning Mold Off of Wallpaper or Painted Walls\r\n\r\nAttacking wallpaper and painted walls or ceilings with bleach could ruin your surfaces. Instead, mix up a solution that includes: \r\n\r\n- 1/4 cup of white vinegar \r\n- two cups of hot water\r\n- two or three tablespoons of borax\r\n\r\nSpray onto the black mold. Then, let it sit for 10 to 20 minutes before scrubbing and wiping dry. \r\n\r\nIf you\'re nervous that your wallpaper is too damp, you should continue patting it dry every 10 minutes or so.\r\n\r\n## Dangers of Black Mold\r\n\r\nSo what\'s the big deal with black mold? Black mold is more than just an eyesore that looks harmless. \r\n\r\nIt can actually impair your health and well-being.Inhaling or touching black mold could:\r\n\r\n- Create an allergic reaction\r\n- Trigger an asthma attack in some people\r\n- Cause shortness of breath\r\n- Put infants, children, elderly, and those with compromised immune systems and lung disease at higher risk\r\n- Some black mold in the bathroom turns into Stachybotrys Chartarum, which is highly toxic and requires removal from a professional\r\n\r\nSome people may not suffer a reaction from black mold. However, it can put everyone who enters your apartment at a health risk. \r\n\r\nRemoving and adequately cleaning for black mold can help reduce complications. It can also make your bathroom look cleaner. \r\n\r\n#### Mold in Bathrooms: Is it the Landlord\'s Responsibility?\r\n\r\nMany renters feel their landlords should deal with black mold, or are legally required to do so. There are currently no federal laws that specify a landlord must deal with black mold.\r\n\r\nSome states and cities have mold regulations. Check with yourstate department of environmental protection and the statedepartment of public health to find out more. \r\n\r\nThere is also some grey area about the landlord\'s responsibility with mold. The landlord is required to provide safe and livable housing. As a result, you might be able to persuade them to deal with the issue. \r\n\r\nCheck your lease terms to see if it specifically references mold or mildew. It\'s also just good practice to loop your landlord into the black mold issue. \r\n\r\nYour landlord may surprise you and volunteer to remove it promptly. It\'s also essential to document the frequency of mold. That way, your landlord can monitor the situation.\r\n\r\nWith a proactive approach, you can eliminate bathroom mold before it gets out of control. Clean, monitor, communicate with your landlord, and repeat!', 0, '2021-03-09 20:29:14', '2021-03-10 20:04:24', '/resources/images/images_shutterstock_532074880-1024x683.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/bathroom-mold', 0, 0);

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (69, 9, 'How Often Do You Need to Replace Your Bathroom Essentials?', '', '![img](/resources/images/images_oval-mirror-near-toilet-bowl-1910472-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\nYou know that saying, \"Out with the old and in with the new?\" We\'re pretty sure it all started when someone stepped into their bathroom in horror and realized nothing was less than a year old except their toilet paper.\r\n\r\nBefore you toss all your bathroom items into one giant garbage bag and start over from scratch, read up on when you should throw out those bathroom must-haves, from toilet brushes to makeup.\r\n\r\n-Bathroom Essentials\r\n-Personal Hygiene Items\r\n-Skincare\r\n-Makeup\r\n-Medications and Supplies\r\n-Words of Advice\r\n\r\n![bathroom essentials](/resources/images/shutterstock_420206308-1024x714.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Bathroom Essentials\r\n\r\nLet\'s kick off the bathroom items list by scrutinizing your must-haves.\r\n\r\n**Toilet Brush** - Science says we should toss our toilet brushes every six months in between safe,baby-proof cleanings. Okay, it\'s not science, but just good common sense to throw out your toilet brush when it\'s too gross to keep in your apartment. You should toss it after a bout of a stomach bug or if it’s been six months. \r\n\r\n**Shower Curtain** - Steam, soap scum, and post-party funk can start to make your shower curtain look dingy and dirty. Add a liner to your shower and scrub it down every few months. Throw a fabric shower curtain in the wash every three or four months. \r\n\r\n**Showerheads and Filters** - Ever wonder how much grime is shooting out of your showerheads and onto your head? If you\'re nervously patting your head right now, you\'re not alone. You probably need to replace your shower head cartridge every six months to a year. It depends on the manufacturing and how often you shower. \r\n\r\n**Bathroom Mat or Rug** - It may come as a shock, but you only need to replace bathroom items like mats once every year or two. It depends on how well you clean it. Wash it once a week with your towels unless you and your roomie have filthy feet. \r\n\r\n**Bathroom Sponges** - Your kitchen sponges that sit around collecting germs are likely dirtier than your toilet. Meanwhile, tidying up your bathroom once in a while isn\'t a cause for alarm to toss all your sponges. Toss those bathroom sponges once every three months unless you keep funky bathroom habits.\r\n\r\n**Bathtub** - Did you know you actually need to replace a bathtub once in a while? If your tub looks like it came from a junkyard, ask your landlord if it\'s been replaced in the last 10 to 15 years. If it\'s been a decade or more, it\'s time. \r\n\r\n**Bathroom Scale Battery** - Have you noticed how everyone keeps the scale in the bathroom so we can shed extra ounces along with extra clothes? If your scale is acting up, try swapping out the batteries. The rule of thumb is every three years for alkaline batteries or 10 years for lithium.\r\n\r\n![towels, loofah and brush](/resources/images/shutterstock_1569849529-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Personal Hygiene Items\r\n\r\nAdulting is all about admitting we can\'t wipe our hands on our pants anymore and using a bath mat instead of tracking water through our apartment. Here\'s what to replace to keep your personal hygiene habits in check.\r\n\r\n**Hand Towels** - Do you creatively turn bathroom items like towels on their bar, so no one notices they\'re permanently stained, frayed, and torn? Time to change them. Otherwise, replace them every two years. Wash them every few days to keep germs at bay.\r\n\r\n**Bath Towels** - It turns out, we should replace our towels before they\'re so threadbare they resemble toilet paper. Try replacing bathroom items like towels every two to three years. That is, unless they\'re exceptionally thin or dingy. In that case, upgrade yourself to guest towel status and dry yourself in luxury.\r\n\r\n**Loofah -** You know that fabulous loofah that made you feel like you were on Oprah\'s Favorite Things? Well, if that was longer than a month ago, you need to replace it. Mold is also a deal-breaker at any point, especially if you\'re Oprah.\r\n\r\n**Toothbrush** - Follow the American Dental Association’s (ADA) advice. Toss your toothbrush every three to four months, or sooner if the bristles are frayed. We also recommend throwing out any toothbrush you suspect your roomie mistakenly used after a late night on a pub crawl. \r\n\r\n**Razor Blades** - There\'s no hard and fast rule about when to throw out razor blades.  Watch for nicking of the skin, pulling, or lots of gunk piling up. A subscription box of your favorite blades can also help you remember and make your skin feel amazing.\r\n\r\n**Hairbrushes and Combs** - It\'s easy to ignore the mess going on with your brush or comb when it\'s shoved into a drawer with other bathroom items. Clean your hair tools once a week or sooner if your hair is long or full of products. Otherwise, toss those hairbrushes and combs about every six months.\r\n\r\n**Contact Lens Case** - The health of your eyes is contingent on where you store your contact lenses. Contact lens cases may look durable. However, the American Optometric Association recommends replacing them within three months. \r\n\r\n**Clothes** - Clothes can last indefinitely. So, you don’t need to replace them until you\'re ready or need an excuse to reinvent your wardrobe. Unless you just wore a sweatshirt for a quick errand, it\'s best to wash your clothes after every wash. And who are we kidding, those bras are only going to get washed after every three or four uses. That’s generally okay if you\'re not working up a New Year\'s resolution sweat.\r\n\r\n![skincare products](/resources/images/shutterstock_556892884-1024x685.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Skincare Products\r\n\r\nIt seems like people are pretty good about investing in skincare. However, many are less conscientious about throwing out those washes and creams that are older than our last relationship. Here\'s how to approach your \"toss the skincare\" routine. \r\n\r\n**Face Wash** - Do facial cleaners even expire when they\'re designed to... well, clean? It\'s time to throw out your facial cleanser if it suddenly smells weird. It’s also time to toss it if it’s now a different color or texture than when you bought it, or it feels *off*.\r\n\r\n**Soap** - Here\'s some good news for hoarders who love to hold onto those fancy bars of soap. Use them up now. A well-drained bar of soap lasts about a month before it starts breaking down and getting slippery. That can make your bathroom items look gross by association.\r\n\r\n**Shampoo** - Did you score an apartment with lots of linen closet space? You can stock it with shampoo and leave it untouched for a few years. However, once it\'s open, you should toss it within 18 months. \r\n\r\n**Creams** - Creams don\'t just feel amazing on our skin. Those bottles and jars make our bathroom look like a spa. Instead of holding onto these bathroom items indefinitely, throw them away within a year. You may need to toss them sooner if your skin starts to feel itchy. You can also squash those temptations by knowing those open jars can breed bacteria and transfer to your face. \r\n\r\n![Makeup brushes](/resources/images/jamie-street-aMuq-Xz7R_M-unsplash-1024x663.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Makeup\r\n\r\nWe all want to look our best strolling through the neighborhood or bar-hopping across the city. However, experts say we still need to toss that makeup before it gives us a funky rash or bacterial infection. \r\n\r\n**Mascara** - Love pumping up your non-existent eyelashes with mascara? Replace your tube of mascara every three months to avoid red eyes and bacterial infections.\r\n\r\n**Eyeliner** - Mascara and eyeliner usually go hand in hand. They should also journey into the trash can together with other bathroom items. Throw out that eyeliner every three months. That’ll help keep your eyes looking healthy and fresh.\r\n\r\n**Foundation** - Foundation gives your skin an even, glowing look. You can use the same bottle for about a year. Throw it out sooner if the consistency changes or you suddenly notice an unpleasant skin reaction.\r\n\r\n**Lipstick** - Worried that we\'re going to insist you toss your super special lipstick? You can keep it for about a year after its first use. However, you can stretch that a bit if the consistency and color are still holding up.\r\n\r\n**Blushes** - Transform your sunless, wintry face with some blush for up to two years after its first use. Then, toss it and find something else to brighten up those cheeks.\r\n\r\n**Eyeshadows** - Like blushes, eyeshadows can usually stick around your bathroom for about two years after their first use. You might want to toss them sooner if you\'re reusing the same old makeup brush or digging your fingers in to scoop out those last powdery bits.\r\n\r\n**Makeup Brushes** - Makeup brushes may keep your face look flawless, but need some upkeep. Maintain them, clean them, then toss them about every three months with your other bathroom items.\r\n\r\n![Medicine cabinet](/resources/images/shutterstock_371789245-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Medications and Supplies\r\n\r\nLet\'s all vow to not be those grown-ups who keep cough syrup that\'s five or six years old around in case of an emergency. Here\'s what to do about those old meds and supplies.\r\n\r\n**Medication** - Unlike a bag of chips that you can probably still eat after the expiration date, you need to toss expired medications immediately. You could risk popping a few pills whose composition has changed and is now too strong or too weak. Then, you may not understand how it\'s impacting your body. Just say no.\r\n\r\n**First Aid Kit** - Remember how you felt like such a grown-up after getting that first aid kit? Now you can go adulting every few months by checking on what’s inside that kit. Make sure any pain relievers are still current, supplies are in good shape, and any flashlight batteries are still working.\r\n\r\n## Three Words of Advice\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt about bathroom items, our advice is, “**toss, replace, and repeat.**” If not for yourself, do it for your roommate, who has to live with the hand towels you haven\'t replaced since graduating college.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:30:45', '2021-03-10 20:06:49', '/resources/images/images_oval-mirror-near-toilet-bowl-1910472-1024x683.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/when-to-replace-bathroom-essentials', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (70, 9, 'Guide to Cleaning the House Safely for Your Baby', '', '![img](/resources/images/images_photo-1554344462-4d4ef7ecabc1-1024x683.jpeg)\r\n\r\nKristin Brown @kristinbrownphotography from Unsplash\r\n\r\nA lot changes when a baby enters your life, even things that might not be obvious at first. Yes, you have another human you are now responsible for, another person living in your home, a baby to love and tend to. However, as a new parent, you may not have thought extensively about how you have to change your home to make itsafe for your little one, or how to ensure your closet of cleaning supplies won’t be a hazard for your baby. Think of all the chemicals that each one of those bottles, wipes, and sprays contains. Uh-oh! All of a sudden your home has turned into a science lab. So, to keep your baby away from becoming part of a science experiment, we created a guide on all things cleaning related when it comes to children in the home.\r\n\r\n#### **Children’s Health and Cleaning Supplies**\r\n\r\nMost cleaning supplies involve a lot of chemicals, many of which are a cause for concern, as they might cause health issues in early childhood. Some of the most common complications can include skin and eye irritation, asthma, hypersensitivity to allergens, chemical burns, and even poisoning.\r\n\r\nA good way to prevent your child from experiencing any of the health issues listed above is to have them avoid:\r\n\r\n- Coming into contact with recently cleaned household items\r\n- Breathing in chemicals emitted by cleaning products or recently cleaned objects\r\n- Accidentally ingesting or spilling cleaning products\r\n\r\nLuckily, you can also avoid specific chemicals in your cleaning supplies to minimize the danger they pose to your child’s health and safety. Keep in mind that these chemicals can compromise your child’s health, so watch out for these guys and the products they’re usually found in:\r\n\r\n- VOCs (paint, resin)\r\n- Bleach (clorox wipes)\r\n- Triclosan (some toothpastes, body washes, etc.)\r\n- Parabens (some shampoos, body washes, etc.)\r\n- Phthalates (detergents, food packaging, etc.)\r\n- Glycol ethers (paints and cleaners)\r\n- Petroleum solvents (paint)\r\n- Sodium lauryl sulfate (cleaning products and cosmetics)\r\n\r\n#### **Tips for Cleaning in a Child Safe Way**\r\n\r\nSimply having cleaning supplies at home that contains potential allergens will not automatically become a problem. However, if bottles of dish soap or bags of cleaning detergent aren’t stored correctly, they might cause trouble. Here are some tips to keep in mind when cleaning to ensure your sparkling clean home remains safe for your child:\r\n\r\n1. **Child-resistant caps:** Remember to buy products with **child-resistant caps**, so that your little one can’t experiment with that pretty blue liquid mama uses for laundry.\r\n2. Create a very clear separation between food and cleaning supplies:\r\n   1. Keep food and all cleaning supplies apart and far removed from each-other.\r\n   2. Do not store your cleaning supplies in old tupperware or any other food containers. Doing so may potentially lead to confusion.\r\n   3. Those curious toddler fingers, if left unattended even for a second, might reach for that bar of soap that looks like a maple leaf and smells like maple syrup and take a very unhealthy bite.\r\n3. **Don’t use poisons for rodents or insects:** Poison is very dangerous, whether it is for pests or your child. Even ant traps tucked around the corners of your home may become an issue. As your baby crawls around, everything in their reach becomes a point of exploration. Make sure that the area they are exploring is harm-free, and keep all harmful chemicals away from their reach.\r\n4. **Create a safety zone:** As your child gets older, you may want to teach them about household chores. Perhaps, they may take an interest in helping you clean up around the house. When this happens, create a cupboard with supplies that is okay for your child to use. Make sure it excludes anything with strong chemical components that may cause allergies or other severe reactions. Maybe having just a clean, colorful mop and a water sprayer in there is all that’s needed for now.\r\n5. **Keep your dishwasher closed:** Sharp items are very common objects in a dishwasher. Knifes, forks, fragile china cups are all the things you don’t want your child to get ahold of unattended while you’re cleaning up. Close the dishwasher to avoid having hand cymbals made of your favorite plates.\r\n6. **Dilute your cleaning products:** Many cleaners are so strong that can diluting them won’t really take anything away from all their cleaning glory. It will lessen the severity of chemical ingredients they include. Bonus point: your cleaning supplies will last you longer. However, make sure to check the product for dilution guidelines.\r\n7. **Ventilate:** After cleaning, always air out the rooms or the items that were cleaned. This will decrease the amount of chemicals that your child inhales and allow object to dry faster. Touching that counter top you just wiped down with Clorox wipes will become safer, too.\r\n\r\n#### **Child Safe Cleaning Supplies You Can Find in Your Cupboard**\r\n\r\nBefore we dive into the store-bought products that could be good counterparts to the more  chemical-heavy options, there are many items you likely already have in your cupboard that are great (and safe) for cleaning. Vinegar, lemon juice, and baking soda can all be mixed in different quantities and combinations to create kid-safe cleaning supplies. Mix some vinegar and water to dust off your shelves with or try using baking soda for oven cleaning. For a natural air-freshener mix two tablespoons of thyme and one sliced lime and spray the mixture around your home.  \r\n\r\n#### **Child Safe Cleaning Supplies Available on the Market**\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of all natural and low chemical cleaning supplies you can find at your local grocery store. These supplies are safer for your little ones and minimize the risks we mentioned above. Below are some suggestions for child safe cleaning supplies:\r\n\r\n- **Laundry Detergent:** Try using Molly’s Suds All Natural Laundry Powder or GreenShield Organic Laundry Detergent in place of the regular, more chemically saturated counterparts.

No, it’s not a good surprise. It’s mold. Stinky, hazardous mold. So what do you if you’ve found mold in your apartment? Don’t worry, we got you. Follow these tips on how to deal with mold.\r\n\r\n### What to do if you find mold in your apartment?\r\n\r\n#### 1. Tell your landlord\r\n\r\nIf you have suspicions that there is mold in your apartment, or if you’ve found and it’s blatantly obvious, don’t wait to tell you landlord. It is in their best interest, as well as yours to get rid of it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Take photos\r\n\r\nTake photos of the mold prior to removing the mold. In case your landlord is slow to take care of it or does not take action at all, (more about that later) you will need proof of the mold situation.\r\n\r\n#### 3. See a doctor\r\n\r\nYou might think you’re having allergies. If you’re constantly sneezing, coughing, experiencing headaches, or even nosebleeds, mold could actually be the culprit. Don’t hesitate to make an appointment with your doctor and get checked out.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Run tests\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the mold is properly removed, first you need to determine what type of mold made it in to your home - yes, there are variations. You or your landlord, depending on your agreement, should schedule an indoor air quality check test. Once the type of mold is determined, then steps for removing it can take place.\r\n\r\n### What if the landlord is failing to take action?\r\n\r\n#### 1. Ask a lawyer\r\n\r\nYour state might not require for you to have a lawyer, but it may be helpful to get a professional’s opinion on your best options and how to proceed in case your landlord does not take action to remove the mold. Remember, mold is harmful to your health and you want it to be gone as soon as possible. You might have to file a lawsuit and the court will be able to order a repair.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Keep documentation\r\n\r\nRemember to keep copies of your written interaction with the landlord, the photos of mold, and any receipts revolving around the issue. For example, keep the results from the indoor air quality test check.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Move out\r\n\r\nIf the issue is not being resolved, it is probably best to move out, especially if the landlord is not responsive. It is probably a good sign that the accommodations aren’t safe for you.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:32:12', '2021-03-10 20:07:22', '/resources/images/images_Screen-Shot-2019-03-22-at-5.14.46-PM.jpeg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/baby-proof-cleaning', 0, 0);

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (73, 9, 'Tidying up with Marie Kondo: 6 Tips to Implement in 2019', '', '![img](/resources/images/images_IMG_1359.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt’s January - the time of new beginnings, New Year’s resolutions and crowded gyms. If you haven’t figured out how to improve your life in 2019, worry not...we have anarticle just for you! Long story short, this is the year when you finally tidy up your apartment and declutter your life!\r\n\r\nIf you’ve done any research on decluttering, there is a chance you’ve come across the KonMari method. It was first featured in the No. 1 New York Times best-selling book “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.” Now the same methods are being showcased in Netflix\'s new show, \"Tidying Up with Marie Kondo.\" The method suggests to only keep things that “spark joy” to make your life happier and your home neater. To give you a gist of Kondo’s method, we put together 5 helpful tips that you can start implementing today.\r\n\r\n### 1. Follow the right order when tidying up your place.\r\n\r\n“Winging it” can be fun and exciting on certain occasions, but not when it comes to cleaning your home. Having a plan is necessary to achieve a neat home where everything has its place. According to Kondo, there is an optimal order to follow when organizing your belongings:\r\n\r\n1. Clothes\r\n2. Books\r\n3. Papers\r\n4. Komono - other household items; miscellaneous random items cluttering up your flat surfaces and drawers.\r\n5. Sentimental items - trophies, postcards, letters and those bridesmaid dresses you’ll never wear again.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, sentimental items are saved for last since they are much harder to part with. For convenience, try creating subcategories within those listed above. This will make organizing and “purging” way easier.\r\n\r\n### 2. Organize by category, not by room.\r\n\r\nMost people tend to clean room by room, moving from one location to another. While it might seem convenient, it can be counterproductive. Stationary is a good example of things that tend to get spread out around the house - a pen here, a pencil there. If you organize room by room, as opposed to categories, you won’t see the full picture of your inventory - what you have in abundance and what you actually need. Need help categorizing your household items? Check out our ultra-detailed printableKonMari checklist!\r\n\r\n### 3. Stop stacking.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the main principles of the KonMari method. According to Marie, putting things in piles is detrimental in many ways. For instance, people tend to forget about items that end up on the bottom of a pile. Plus, when stacking things on top of one another, it’s easy to go on forever without noticing how much stuff you’ve accumulated. It seems pretty obvious that it’s easier to find a book on a shelf than in a pile, but we often forget that the same principle can be applied to other belongings like clothes or stationery.\r\n\r\n### 4. Arrange your clothes vertically and by color.\r\n\r\nThink about your closet and that pile of shirts somewhere on a shelf or in your bottom drawer. It’s easy to forget about clothes on the bottom of the stack, especially if the top items are bulkier. Even if you remember them, they are probably wrinkled up under the weight of the clothes on top. To tackle this issue, Marie Kondo recommends dividing clothes by categories, folding them and storing vertically when possible for better visibility. Keep clothes of the same color together arranging them from darkest to lightest, left to right respectively, creating a gradient. Only hang clothes that have to be hanged - the ones made out of soft breezy fabrics, tailored cuts and easily-wrinkled clothing that should not be folded. When hanging these items try to arrange them in a way so they rise towards the right. Longer, heavier items should stay on the left side, shorter and lighter items on the right side creating a sort of a triangle. There are numerous benefits to doing so.You\'ll get a better understanding of your wardrobe, what you have, what you need, and what you can get rid of. Marie has a series ofvideos on how to properly fold different items to keep them fresh, wrinkle-free, and vertically storable.\r\n\r\n### 5. Keep all paper in one spot.\r\n\r\nThe basic principle regarding paper outlined in Marie Kondo’s book is to throw it all away. Well, almost all of it. She recommends only keeping documents that fall into one of three categories: currently used, needed for a limited period of time, and documents that have to be kept forever, e.g. your birth certificate and social security number. The rest have to go. She also points out that all documents that you have to deal with should be stored in one place and not scattered around your house. Papers that have to be kept indefinitely can all go in one file, you can store the rest in separate files in a plastic folder for easier access. And no more stacks!\r\n\r\n### 6. Store bags in another bag.\r\n\r\nTotes, handbags, clutches, backpacks - those things take up a lot of a precious space. After years of experimenting, Marie Kondo came up with a simple but genius method of storing bags. It will drastically reduce space required for their storage and make it easier to find a purse you’d like to wear today. Just nest bags of the same type into one another! That way all your clutches will be in one place and easy to find. Make sure to keep all the straps and handles outside in plain view. This method not only saves your space, but also teaches you a great habit of emptying your purse whenever you don’t use it.\r\n\r\nHome organization is a science and organizing consultants are there for a reason. However, we strongly believe that if you take time and put some effort into implementing the above-mentioned principles, your home will become a neater place in no time. And according to Marie Kondo, a clean and organized home is the key to a happier life!', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-10 20:08:55', '/resources/images/images_IMG_1359.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/tidying-up-with-marie-kondo-6-tips-to-implement-in-2019', 0, 0);

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (75, 7, 'Deciding If It\'s Safe to Go Out', '', '![Woman in mask](/resources/images/safe-to-go-out.jpg)\n\nMany Maryland businesses that were forced to close due to coronavirus are now open. That has a lot of people wondering: Is it safe to go out?\n\nThough some businesses are open and restrictions around some activities have been lifted, it is still important to consider your specific health situation when making this important decision.\n\nThere are many activities that people were not allowed to do in Maryland during the beginning of the pandemic. Now, many of these businesses and activities are open. Some activities that you have a choice to take part in include:\n\n-Going out to eat at a restaurant or bar\n-Getting a haircut\n- Getting your nails done\n- Going to the movies\n- Going to shopping malls\n-Outdoor activities like visiting public parks or fishing\n\nRight now, the question shouldn\'t be \"Is it safe to go out?\" Instead, you should be asking yourself if it\'s safe for *you *to do a specific activity or visit a certain place.\n\n## Going Out During the Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nDeciding if it\'s safe to go out can be difficult at this time. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), here are the high-level questions you should be asking yourself before going out:\n\n- Is coronavirus spreading in your community?\n- Will you potentially have close contact with someone who is sick?\n- Will you potentially have close contact with people who are not wearing a face mask?\n- Do you have or live with someone who has anunderlying condition that could increase the risk of severe illness?\n- Do you take everyday coronavirus prevention measures?\n\nEven if you answer all of these questions and determine that you might be able to go out, there are other factors that you should take into consideration.\n\n### The Number of People\n\nThe more people you interact with, the higher your risk of contracting the virus will be.Social distancing is currently one of the best tools we have for preventing this virus.\n\nPeople who feel sick or areconcerned they may have the virus should stay home to avoid infecting others, but even if someone doesn\'t appear sick or show anycoronavirus symptoms, they could be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease and infect others.\n\n### Ability to Physically Distance\n\nIf you are going out, you should ideally be able to remain at least six feet away from people who do not live with you. The closer you are to other people, the higher your risk of contracting the virus.\n\nWearing a mask can help reduce the chance of coronavirus spread when you can\'t maintain the recommended six feet of distancing.\n\n### Length of Time\n\nIf the activity you are participating in or the place you are going requires prolonged time in close contact with others, then the risk of contracting the virus will be higher.\n\nIf you are an asymptomatic carrier of the virus, prolonged contact with others could also put them at risk for contracting the virus. Wearing a mask can help reduce this risk, but the longer you are in close contact with others, the higher the chance that you or someone else will take off their mask or have it slip off of their face.\n\n## Coronavirus Tips: Going Out Safely\n\nIf you take all of these factors into account and decide that it\'s safe to go out, you still need to take some basic prevention measures to help keep yourself safe.\n\n### Practice Basic Prevention Measures\n\nWhen you are out, continue practicing the prevention measures that we know keep us safe from coronavirus. This includes:\n\n- Staying at least six feet apart from others\n- Wearing a mask\n-Washing your hands often\n-Avoiding touching your face\n- Practicing proper coughing etiquette\n- Monitoring your health before leaving the house\n\n### Have a Kit\n\nIf you decide to go out, it\'s important to have some essentials on hand for preventing coronavirus infection and properlydisinfecting yourself and high-touch objects. This should include:\n\n- A face mask\n- Hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol\n- Tissues, which can be used to cover your mouth if you sneeze or cough and when you must come in contact with high-touch surfaces like doorknobs\n\n### Stay Outside\n\nMany indoor places are currently open to the public in a limited capacity. However, the CDC currently recommends being outside when possible, especially if you are going to be in close proximity to other people.\n\nOutdoor locations usually provide ample room to remain six or more feet apart from others. If you must be indoors, look for a location with some additional air ventilation, such as an open window.\n\n### Look for Barriers\n\nBarriers between people — such as plexiglass screens, floor markings and modified layouts — can help limit the spread of coronavirus. This not only keeps the droplets that help spread coronavirus from reaching others, but it also provides a visual reminder for people to keep their distance.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-10 23:44:51', '/resources/images/safe-to-go-out.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/daily-life-coping/safe-to-go-out', 1, 0);

You may find yourself afraid to go, even when it\'s necessary.\n\nNow more than ever, it is important to keep yourself healthy. Keeping yourself healthy means addressing health problems as they arise.\n\nThis includes getting evaluated by your primary care physician and going to an emergency room (ER) when appropriate.\n\n## Should I Go to the Hospital?\n\nStaying at home when possible is an important part of containing coronavirus spread. However, people experiencing medical emergencies or those that need urgent medical care should not stay at home. If you need care, you should go to the hospital.\n\nNow more than ever, ERs are here for communities in Maryland and the nation. Hospitals across the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) will never close our doors to anyone who needs care.\n\nPlease do not ignore your body. Warning signs and symptoms should be discussed with your doctor or evaluated at an urgent care or ER, depending on the severity of symptoms.\n\n## When to Go to the ER\n\nGo to the hospital if you experience symptoms of *any *life-threatening illnesses, not just forsymptoms of coronavirus.\n\n### Symptoms of a Medical Emergency\n\nSymptoms that may indicate a life-threatening emergency include:\n\n- Difficulty breathing, shortness of breath\n- Chest or upper abdominal pain or pressure\n- Fainting, sudden dizziness or weakness\n- Changes in vision\n- Confusion or changes in mental status\n- Any sudden or severe pain\n- Uncontrolled bleeding\n- Severe or persistent vomiting or diarrhea\n- Coughing or vomiting blood\n- Difficulty speaking\n\nGetting urgent help when needed is especially important for strokes and heart attacks. Outcomes for these medical emergencies are tied to how quickly the patient receives care, so delaying getting treatment due to coronavirus fears can have serious consequences.\n\nPeople withexisting medical conditions that increase the likelihood of experiencing a medical emergency should speak with their doctor about managing their condition during the pandemic.\n\n## When to Go to the Doctor\n\nBeyond emergency care, health problems that are treated earlier do much better than health problems that are treated later. Sometimes irreversible damage can occur when you delay care. For example, wounds that are not appropriately cared for become infected or need more extensive procedures than they would have otherwise.\n\nWhile it\'s important to continuesocial distancing as much as possible, you can still go to the doctor\'s office for some regularly scheduled wellness exams. For example, it is important to attend exams where a child will be getting routine vaccinations to protect them against other viruses and bacteria in the community.\n\nDepending on the situation, your primary care doctor may provide you an in-person visit or a telehealth evaluation. Contact your doctor to find out what type of visit might be appropriate. You can useMyPortfolio to communicate with your UMMS provider.\n\n### Telemedicine Visits\n\nA telehealth evaluation can address some non-urgent health concerns, including routine appointments, wound evaluations and medication refills or adjustments.\n\nMany UMMS physicians have the ability to evaluate you via telemedicine, which means you don\'t need to leave your home for a doctor evaluation.\n\nIf you have a health question, scheduling a telemedicine appointment can be an option for non-emergency situations. Call your physician to learn more about the best options for your specific health needs.\n\n## Going to the Hospital for Coronavirus\n\nMost people who have coronavirus experience mildsymptoms that can be treated at home. However, some people, particularly those who haveunderlying conditions, may experience more serious symptoms that require treatment at a hospital.\n\nSerious coronavirus symptoms that could require emergency care include:\n\n- Trouble breathing\n- Persistent pain or pressure in the chest\n- New confusion or can\'t be woken up\n- Lips or face turning blue\n\nIf you have questions about your symptoms, call your doctor or talk to a registered nurse through theUMMS Nurse Call Line.\n\nIf your symptoms are life-threatening, call 911 or go to the ER right away.\n\n## Hospital Safety During Coronavirus\n\nHospitals across the nation are facing challenges due to the pandemic. Despite this, hospitals are still safe places to come to for care.\n\nThere are a number of measures that University of Maryland Medical System hospitals are taking to keep you safe.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nYou may not have had reason to wonder how to remove gel nail polish before, but if you’re currently avoiding your salon and going theDIY nail route instead, it’s important to learn how to do it properly. Spoiler alert: Just ripping off your gel manicure is not a good idea. Everything might appear to be okay to the naked eye, but you actually strip the delicate layers of the nail plate (the hard part of the nail that grows out) when youtear your gel nails off this way, and it can potentially cause permanent damage.\n\nTo avoid screwing up your nails, we asked celebrity manicuristPatricia Yankee how to remove gel nail polish at home. Her professional advice to ensure the health of your nails is to head back to your salon for proper removal when it’s safe to do so. But if you can’t or don’t want to make the trip right now, there are a few easy-to-follow steps to get similar results at home.\n\n## Step 1: Protect your cuticles.\n\nAcetone—which you’ll need to remove your gels—can wreak havoc on the skin around your nails, so you need to protect your poorcuticles. “Before you soak, protect the surrounding areas with a cuticle oil,” Yankee explains. There’s no need to get a fancy specialty cuticle oil unless you want to. A tried-and-true quick home remedy is Vaseline ($3,Amazon). The petroleum jelly will create a barrier to minimize the acetone’s damage. Aquaphor ($10,Amazon) works too.\n\n## Step 2: Loosen up the top layer with a coarse nail file.\n\nThe gel topcoat is a tough nearly impermeable layer that seals the color in place—that’s why gelmanicures are able to last for weeks instead of days. Scratching the surface with a coarse nail file will help the acetone to penetrate without a hitch. “When filing, apply a light and parallel pressure,” Yankee says, which will help you avoid scratching the nail plate underneath.\n\n## Step 3: Soak your nails in acetone using cotton balls and aluminum foil.\n\nAcetone ($5,Ulta) is stronger and more effective than non-acetone nail polish remover, making it exactly what you need to remove your gel nail polish. Drench some cotton balls with the stuff, then hold them in place on your nails by wrapping each finger with aluminum foil. According to Yankee, this traps in heat to help the gel break down faster. Gel polish formulas vary in strength, so the wait time can be anywhere between 10 and 20 minutes. If you don’t get it exactly right, you can always rewrap and keep on soaking.\n\nYankee\'s expert tip: “Sometimes it’s best to do one hand at a time at home. I like to start with the dominant hand to get the toughest part out of the way.” So if you’re a lefty, begin soaking the nails on your left hand, and then your right hand will be a breeze. “It’s a small change, but it makes a huge difference,” she says.\n\n## Step 4: Gently scrape away the layers and soak again if needed.\n\nOnce you give the acetone time to work its magic, grab the file (or a wooden orange stick) and continue to gently scrape the layers to safely remove the gel polish from yournail. If you’ve soaked long enough, the first few coats will begin to peel off easily.\n\nIf you encounter more resistant layers, you’ll need to loosen them up with another acetone soak. Repeat the soaking-and-scraping method until you’ve safely removed all of the color, including the base coat.\n\n## Step 5: Wash up and moisturize.\n\n“After you finish soaking in acetone, you want to make sure that you wash thoroughly,” Yankee says. She also suggests putting on another coat of cuticle oil. If you want to get a little fancier thanpetroleum jelly this time, try the highly rated favorite Maccibelle Cuticle Oil ($7,Amazon), which comes in three different scents: milk and honey, pomegranate, and tea tree–lavender.\n\nYankee also suggests keeping the habit up for a few days “just to replenish the moisture in your nails,” since acetone can be so harsh.\n\n## Bonus: A few products to make your life easier next time.\n\nThe process of removing gel nail polish isn’t exactly the hardest thing in the world, but hey, sometimes you want to streamline the whole ordeal even more. There are sets with everything you need to take off your gels, as well as handy products to troubleshoot some of the more annoying parts of the process.

I know I’m not the first person to slam a finger in a car door or jam it in a window, so I took my questions to the professionals to get all the answers, from basic first aid to the right way to cover up a bruised fingernail or other nail mishap. Here’s what you need to know.\n\n## What causes nail bruising?\n\nLike the bruises you get on any part of your body, nail bruising happens when blunt force crushes the small blood vessels under your skin, perU.S. National Library of Medicine. Most fingernail injuries affect the nail plate (the hard part of the nail that grows out), which can crack and potentially fall off, and the nail bed (the skin underneath the nail plate), which can bleed and bruise. So when we’re discussing a nail bruise, we’re really talking about a nail *plate* bruise.\n\nThat said, what you might assume is a nail bruise because of the purple or black color might actually be blood, since the same kind of trauma that causes bruising can cause bleeding too. The official name for this is a subungual hematoma, according to theAmerican Osteopathic College of Dermatology. That pretty much just means a blood blister under the nail.\n\n## What should I do if I bruise my fingernail?\n\nWhen the injury first happens, you can take care of any immediate first aid needs. Basic wound care applies here: Put pressure on the area to slow the bleeding if there is any, clean the wound with soap and water, apply a bandage, and take an analgesic tohelp with pain if needed. You can also ice your finger if you’ve got swelling in the area, dermatologist Ted Lain, M.D., tells SELF.\n\nAs you do all this, you should also assess the extent of the damage and whether or not a trip to the doctor is necessary. Speaking of...\n\n## When should I see a doctor?\n\nThere are a few things to look out for when it comes to deciding if you should see a doctor right after you injure your fingernail. Some signs include: \n\n- **Lack of blood flow**: Press on a portion of the nail or finger that is not injured. If the area turns white and then turns pink within seconds when you release the pressure, you’ve got good capillary refill. That means blood is still flowing. If not, it’s a good idea to get it checked out.\n- **Loss of sensation:** You should also touch the tip of your finger to make sure you still have feeling in the area. “As long as you can feel everything, you probably don’t have anynerve damage,” says Dr. Lain.\n- **Unusual colors in your fingertip:** You also want to make sure the skin at the tip of the finger isn’t blue or blanched white—unusual colors are a sign you need to see a doctor.\n- **A lot of blood under your nail bed:** Because large subungual hematomas increase the risk of your fingernail falling off, doctors will often drain accumulated blood by drilling a small hole in the nail plate. In Dr. Lain’s clinical experience, blood that encompasses more than 50 percent of your nail is a good sign you should hit up a doctor, but there are no official recommendations. You can play it safe and have a smaller subungual hematoma drained too. The key is to get it done within 24 hours, before the blood coagulates.\n- **Injury to your nail matrix:** This is the tissue at the base of your nail where nail growth happens. Since damage to the nail matrix could cause your nail to grow out strangely for the rest of your life, you should let a professional evaluate how serious it is just in case. “If the pressure can be released, then we can feasibly help to control any damage that might happen to the nail matrix,” says Dr. Lain.\n\nIf you’re clear of the above signs, you’re likely good to skip the doctor and let the bruise heal up on its own. As for a cracked nail, you’ll have to wait for the damage to grow out. (Fun fact: Fingernails grow an average of 3.47 millimeters a month according to one 2010 study published in the*Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology*.)\n\nAll that said, in the days following the injury, you should also be on the lookout for signs of infection.\n\n## What are the signs of a fingernail infection?\n\n“If there is any pus, if it becomes really red and hot after the fact, or there is a lot of swelling, it’s a sign ofinfection,” dermatologist Mona Gohara, M.D., tells SELF. “If it’s green, that’s another sign that there is bacteria in there.” There might also be persistent pain that just doesn\'t wane. These symptoms are all signs you need to see a doctor. Make an appointment with a dermatologist, primary care physician, or at an urgent care center to get the wound drained and get a prescription for antibiotics.\n\nIf you see red streaks on your hand or forearm or you feelfeverish or nauseated, it could be much more serious. These are signs that the infection has spread to the bloodstream, which can lead to sepsis. \"Sepsis is extremely serious, and anyone seeing the infection worsening with the spread to the hand should seek care at an E.R.,\" says Dr. Lain.\n\n## What should I do if my fingernail starts falling off (or falls off completely)?\n\nYes, your fingernail falling off is a thing that can happen, so it’s good to be prepared. After an acute trauma, your nail may turn black and seem like it\'s barely hanging on. Please, please, don’t pull it off. You can cut it down, but let the injury grow out on its own. “Leave it alone, because there is new nail growing underneath,” says Dr. Lain. “The new nail will push up the old nail, and it will come off when it’s ready.”\n\nOnce the fingernail falls off, it’s a good idea to protect the sensitive skin of the nail bed with a Band-Aid. “If you leave it open to the air, it can get very dry and very cracked, and if it gets traumatized, it can affect how the nail grows,” says Dr. Lain.\n\nIn some cases, like if the nail bed is infected, the doctor might have to remove the nail by force. This procedure is called a nail evulsion: First, they numb up your finger with a local numbing treatment. Then the doctor uses special tools to lift the nail on each side and peel the plate away from the nail bed. (Kind of sounds like something out of ahorror movie, right?)\n\n## Can I get a manicure with a bruised fingernail?\n\nNow, here’s what I really wanted to know: Can I cover a cracked or bruised fingernail with pretty polish while it’s healing? The answer is yes—with a few precautions.\n\nDr. Lain recommends first coating the nail with a layer of nail hardener to help protect the nail plate, and Dr. Gohara says nail polish is totally fine if there is just a crack in the nail (once the bleeding has stopped and the injury has had some time to heal, of course).\n\nThat said, you should put a pause on your gel manicure habit. \"It is not the application of the gel, or the product itself, but rather the removal process that concerns me,\" says Dr. Lain. \"Gel polish is commonly removed incorrectly, leading to a compromise of the nail\'s integrity or worsening of underlying damage.\"\n\nAbove all, both derms say to avoid the nail salon. “If somebody is using scissors and cutting, you can introduce bacteria or fungus, because the nail has already been compromised,” says Dr. Gohara. It’s best to stick toDIY manicures until the nail has grown out. Luckily, we’re avoiding nail salons right now anyway, right?', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '/resources/images/bruised_nail_hand.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/bruised-fingernail', 1, 0);

Before this year, many of us thought we were handling our hands and fingers like pros, but, let\'s face it, many of us had less than ideal habits. Maybe you skimped on the 20-second handwashing rule, or maybe you had clean hands but used them totouch your face and rub your eyes constantly. And there are those who, try as we might, can\'t figure out how to stop biting our nails.\n\nIf you’re (like me) among the nail-biting people of the world, then you’ve probably discovered the following: Nail biting doesn’t stop just because we want it to. My guess? Even though the stakes are high given thenew coronavirus pandemic, many of us are probably having a tough time avoiding nibbling away at our nubby nails from time to time. You’re not alone. Way before the new coronavirus was disrupting our lives, writer Emily Rekstis tried a few common hacks to see if she could break herself of the habit. You’ll find those tips below. But before we get into that, let’s run through a few basics, shall we?\n\n## Why do people bite their nails?\n\nYou might not know this, but nail biting falls under a list of behaviors known asbody-focused repetitive disorders (or BFRDs), which are those little habits we have (think hair pulling or skin picking) that, when done often enough, can cause harm. AsSELF previously reported, it’s not entirely clear why some people have BFRDs, but there are known triggers. SELF previously reported that those triggers fall into five main categories: There are sensory triggers, which might be anything that evokes the senses (taste, touch, sight, smell, or hearing). You may be triggered by certain thoughts or beliefs (these are called cognitive triggers). You could bite your nails when you face something called a motor trigger, which involves postures and movements that you make (and might not even be aware of). Even certain places might make your nail nibbling more prevalent (these are called setting triggers).\n\n## Is nail biting actually that bad?\n\nHere’s the thing: Some viruses live on surfaces and when we touch those spots (like doorknobs or subway rails) and then touch our eyes, nose, or mouths, we run the risk of helping those germs get into our bodies,Philip Tierno, Ph.D., microbiologist and clinical professor of pathology at NYU Langone,previously told SELF. It’s not a given that biting your nails will make you sick more frequently than those who don’t, but putting your fingers in your mouth isn’t doing your immune system any favors.\n\nBut even if you’re not thinking about germs, biting your fingernails can also cause damage to your nail bed, theMayo Clinic explains. This can leave tiny cuts that put you at greater risk for bacteria and fungus to hang out and cause infections, theMayo Clinic says. Biting your fingernails can also potentially damage your teeth, according to theMayo Clinic. All of that means it’s best to keep your fingernails out of your mouth. So, how to do that you may wonder?\n\n## There are things you can do to help you stop biting your nails.\n\nIt might be possible for some people to go cold turkey, but many people will need some strategies to guide them. The tips from theAmerican Academy of Dermatology Association (AADA) are a great place to start. They offer a mix of practical strategies as well as mental exercises that can help you. For example, among the strategies recommended by the AADA are identifying your nail-biting triggers, keeping your nails clipped short, and taking a gradual approach (as in, just work on stopping biting one fingernail at a time). The AADA also explains that nail biting might be a sign of emotional or psychological distress. So if you’ve tried to stop biting your nails and can’t, there’s no harm in contacting your doctor to discuss your concerns. And if you develop an infection from nail biting, a dermatologist or other healthcare provider can help you treat it, theAADA says.\n\n## Here’s what happened when Emily Rekstis tried to break her nail-biting habit. Here’s what she said:\n\nBiting your nails is a terrible habit, one that I can’t seem to knock. I turned to the internet and talked to experts to find the best hacks that will hopefully help me break my habit. Here\'s how my little experiment went:\n\n1. I dipped my nails in salt.\n\n![Image may contain Human Person and Nail](/resources/images/IMG_5229.JPG)\n\n\n\nI’ve used anti-biting polish like Maval Stop Polish ($31,Walmart) in the past, so I didn’t want to try that this time around. Instead, I went for aDIY solution that served the same purpose. This hack I found while scrolling through the many threads on Reddit about nail biting: First, you dip your nails in water. Then you dip them in salt and dust off some of the excess (funnily, this is the same process I use when putting salt on the rim of a margarita glass).\n\nLike the anti-biting polish, the salt is meant to leave a gross taste in your mouth when you bite your nails. “This unappealing taste is worth a try if you are looking for a DIY solution,” dermatologistMelanie D. Palm, M.D., explains. “But some may not find this is enough of a deterrent, and the salt granules may cause a mess.” She also points out that if you rub your eye with salt-covered fingers, it can really sting and hurt. Keeping that in mind, I decided to give it a try.\n\n**Did it work?**\n\nSimply put—no, it did not work and for many different reasons. First, it was hard to keep the salt on the nails. It was fine if I was justwatching TV or reading. But when I did it before I started working on my computer, thesalt would fall off and make a mess on my keyboard. I also did it before going out one night, so I rubbed some (actually, most) of it off before hopping on the subway. It just felt kind of sloppy and weird to have my fingers covered in salt. After removing some there was still the faintest hint of salt left behind. However, this didn’t really bother me.\n\nWhich brings me to another reason it didn’t really work. I love salt! I don’t love huge amounts of it like my fingers would pick up when they first were dipped in it. But the faint traces the salt would leave behind after most of it fell off did not keep me from putting my finger in my mouth. The only thing I will say is that the taste of salt would remind me that my nails were in my mouth when they weren’t supposed to be—not a great deterrent, but a good wakeup call.\n\n2. I rubbed jalapeños on each nail.\n\n![Image may contain Human Person Finger Nail and Hand](/resources/images/IMG_5213.JPG)\n\nThis was another Reddit hack I found in the same thread as the salt tip, and the premise is the same: putting a bad flavor on your nails to keep you from continuing to bite them. I bought a jar of jalapeño slices and rubbed the juice all over my cuticles and nail beds. Palm notes, “This is relatively safe, but one should make sure they aren’t allergic to the pepper or accidentally rub their face and eyes, as this could cause a severe reaction.” I do not have an allergy to peppers, so I went for it. I was very—VERY—careful not to rub my eyes afterward.\n\n**Did it work?**\n\nThis worked a little better than the salt did since the taste was more shocking when my tongue hit it. My hand would pull out of my mouth immediately. The shock of a spicy jalapeño is not something you’re used to tasting without other food. However, thespiciness only lasted an hour or so, and unlike the salt, there really wasn’t even the slightest hint of residue. So when I was out of the house for long periods of time, it would wear off, and I\'d end up biting away again.\n\nBut the real reason I can\'t recommend this one, is the sheer ickiness factor. If I thought the salt felt dirty, this felt even dirtier. My fingers felt sticky and stinky after I’d rubbed a pepper all over them. Even if I just kept it to the nail, the juices would drip all over my fingers. It felt like I needed to wash my hands after, because, honestly, I did! But then that would defeat the purpose of using the jalapeño.\n\n3. I carried cuticle scissors around.\n\n![This image may contain Human Person Manicure Nail Jewelry Accessories Accessory Ring and Finger](/resources/images/IMG_5243.JPG)\n\nWhen I say I bite my nails, I mean I bite my nails and tear off the cuticles surrounding them. Unfortunately, this means my cuticles are sore and often bleeding. Carrying a cuticle cutter around, like the Revlon Full Jaw Cuticle Nipper ($14,Walmart), was supposed to give me a way to deal with my ragged cuticles so I wouldn\'t pick at them with my teeth. “Some people are able to avoid manipulating the cuticles by trimming them when they have the urge to pick them,” explains RealSelf contributor,Sejal Shah, M.D. I was hoping that I was one of those “some people” she was talking about.\n\n**Did it work?**\n\nYes and no. Yes, because having the scissors at hand (pun intended) kept me from using my mouth to clean up hangnails or cuticles. With that being said, having them around almost brought more attention to the work my nails and cuticles needed. I found myself becoming obsessive about keeping my cuticles clean and precise. I’d whip out the scissors at any moment—and place—if I noticed an issue. I’m not very good with the scissors, so I almost always messed up mycuticles and nails even more, and then would spend more time fixing them.\n\nThe scissors did keep my hands out of my mouth. But it did not help with my quest for stronger, longer, healthier nails and cuticles. In fact, my cuticles looked even worse after this hack.\n\n4. I snapped a rubber band on my wrist.\n\n![Image may contain Human Person Finger Female Woman Blonde Teen Girl Kid and Child](/resources/images/IMG_5209.JPG)\n\nThe idea here was to substitute a different nervous habit for the one I was trying to break. Unlike the salt and jalapeño, this hack occupied my hands with something other than biting my nails. “It\'s basically an alternative behavior,” explains Shah. “Nail biting or picking cuticles are often nervous habits or a way to relieve stress, so by engaging in analternative behavior when you feel the urge, especially one that keeps your hands busy, you may be able to avoid biting your nails.”\n\n**Did it work?**\n\nNot really. There isn’t too much to say about this one because it simply did not work. I think that maybe if I were to continue doing it that I would subconsciously begin to reach for the rubber band instead of putting my nails between my teeth. However, my immediate reaction was to put my nails in my mouth, not go to my wrist. When I found myself going to my mouth with my fingers, I would move to the rubber band, but other times it was too late, and I already was biting my nails.\n\n5. I just thought about all the bacteria on my fingers.\n\n![Image may contain Human Person Manicure Nail Jewelry Ring Accessories and Accessory](/resources/images/IMG_5198.JPG)\n\nOne of the motivations for getting back on the no-biting wagon was that in the past two months, I’ve gotten tonsillitis twice, and I’m convinced it’s because of the germs I’m putting in my mouth when biting my nails. I asked two doctors about it, and while they both said I\'m definitely ingesting some grossness—I live in NYC for goodness sake!—it\'s unlikely that\'s what\'s causing my illnesses.\n\nMy fear (however unfounded) ended up working in my favor, though, when I tried a mindset practice that kept coming up in my research. Each time I found myself putting my hands in my mouth, I thought about where my hands had been that day, all the germs that might be on them, and how much I wanted not to get sick. PsychologistEmma Seppälä tells SELF that using my worry about ingesting bacteria to fight the urge to bite makes a lot of sense. “Ways to break bad habits are strengthening your willpower through exercises likemindfulness and meditation,\" she says. Tapping into my emotional response could help me resist the pull of my ingrained behavior.\n\nEven though I know that nail biting and tonsillitis aren’t directly associated, I could use my distinct memories of the sore throat and fevers as an easy tool to use to break my habit.\n\n**Did it work?**\n\nSurprisingly, this trick seemed to work best. Since I really don’t want to bite my nails, I stopped when I noticed what I was doing. It’s hard to say if this would always work, though. Since I was working on a story about biting my nails, I was often thinking about it and making notes for this piece. However, in day-to-day circumstances, I bite my nails without even realizing I’m doing it a lot of times. That’s where the other hacks like salt and jalapeño come in. They may not have turned me away from doing it, but they did make me aware that my hands were in my mouth—which made them beneficial in their own sort of way.\n\n## The lesson: When it comes to nail biting, mindfulness helps.\n\nThese hacks didn’t help much more than my mom applying anti-biting polish when I was younger. Will I be rubbing salt or jalapeños on my nails again? No, definitely not. I might keep carrying a cuticle scissor around with me, though, so that if I find myself obsessing over some rough skin, I can take care of it without turning to myteeth. The best thing to come out of my testing was realizing that my nail biting is clearly a subconscious behavior I do when I’manxious and bored, so the best thing for me to do is notice and stop. Being mindful of the fact that I\'m biting my nails—and when and where and how often I do it—is step one in getting myself not to bite my nails. So that\'s what I\'m going to focus on. And when I do, thinking about all the gross germs on my fingers is motivation enough to keep them out of my mouth. At least for the moment.\n\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-11 13:23:38', '/resources/images/nail_biting.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/nail-biting-hacks', 1, 0);

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nI wanted to hate Olive & June’s Everything Manicure Box. The skeptical side of me thought, There’s no way this is a good deal. *$80?* To do my own nails? Please. Still, I yearned for a manicure—to feel a surge of joy and normalcy upon glimpsing my pretty, painted hands, even if I’m not headed to any formal events or an office soon. So when I received a sample, I decided to try it with an open mind, and somewhat begrudgingly, I really, really like this dang box. It makes doing my own nails way more enjoyable than it’s ever been before.\n\nFor a little background: I have a long-running relationship with nails/manicures. I sucked my thumb until the age of five, when my dentist persuaded me out of it (with the promise of an enormous stuffed reindeer, which I named, no lie, Rudolph Giuliani). But then I took up nail biting instead. In my adolescent years, I tried to quit by using bitter-tasting polishes designed to turn me off, but this didn’t work. I continued chewing my nails, hated myself for doing so, and, in turn, spiraled and bit them more.\n\nIn my 20s, after I moved to New York and landed my first job, I finally stopped nail biting by getting regular gel manicures. On one hand, yay, I no longer bit my nails! On the other hand, I became reliant on salons, spending $40 every two weeks to swap out shades. This was incredibly costly, an exhausting use of time, and—as I stuck my hands under a U.V. light to dry the gel—potentially damaging for my skin. I realized that I couldn’t, nor did I *want* to, spend the rest of my life replacing one habit with another. I eventually gave up manicures completely and just let my natural nails live and grow. I started exercising more to (somewhat) manage my anxiety, and I’m pleased to report that I haven’t bitten my nails in several years. I’m no longer dependent on manicures as part of my routine, which strangely frees me to miss them as acts of self-care. With the pandemic forcing me to stay home (which is, I recognize, a privilege), I’ve started missing the pampering of my hands. Enter the Everything Box.\n\nInside this pale pink box is, true to its name, everything you need for a salon-quality manicure, including specific tips and tricks (like how to manage cuticles), six nail colors of your choice (from subtle nudes to splashy neons), and a glossy, quick-drying top coat. As someone who struggles to find polish that isn’t too watery or clumpy, I can vouch for how this polish goes on evenly and stays put for, miraculously, at least a week. The bottle’s brush is just the right size and shape to cover my nail’s surface in two to three strokes (something that gives me trouble with thinner-brush bottles from brands like Essie and Sally Hansen).\n\nBut the best part of the kit, what really makes it the “everything,” are the tools, of which there are many: a nail-polish-remover pot (which you use with a satisfying soak of your finger in a small sponge), a nail clipper (designed with a flat edge for level clipping), a dual-grit nail file (way stronger than my flimsy emery boards), a buffer cube (for shaping, smoothing, and keeping cuticles in line), a universal polish bottle handle (a rubber insert that covers the top of a polish handle and makes it far easier to apply coats, especially when using your nondominant hand), cuticle serum (made with nourishing cactus flower), and a clean-up brush (my personal favorite tool). No matter how messy my manicure is, at the end I use this fine brush dipped in remover to clean up errant polish, and presto, my nails look like they’ve seen the inside of a salon.\n\nRealistically, $80 isn’t financially feasible for everyone. For $50, Olive & June also offers a Studio Box, which comes with all of the tools plus one polish of your choice and a top coat. For $42, you can buy the Tool Box, which includes just the tools, to be paired with any polishes you already own. FWIW, while you can certainly purchase everything in these kits piecemeal, for the price, you get thoughtfully designed, high-quality products and expert advice, all in a pleasing package. With a single bottle of polish usually costing around $7 to $9 a pop, to get six (and a top coat) in colors I love is a good deal. I expect to use the contents of this kit for months to come and am excited to gift it to friends, especially to those who need a pick-me-up. Final verdict?

Since I’m constantly opening packages and typing stories, wearing gel nail polish has been a saving grace when it comes to preserving my mani. While I love the flexibility a regular manicure provides,gel polish is so much more durable—which is why I tend to stretch each manicure for as long as possible.\n\n“With gel polish, your manicure can last from two to three weeks, but with regular polish you\'re lucky if it lasts five to seven days without chipping,” Kristin Pulaski, owner ofPaintbucket Nails in Brooklyn, tells SELF. According to Pulaski, in addition to staying power, another great benefit of gel is that it provides a harder layer of protection over the natural nail, which can result in increased nail growth.\n\nUnfortunately, this durability and protection can be rough on your nails and make them weaker and prone to splitting. No one wants that, so there are a few things to keep in mind to maintain the health of your nails when you’re getting gels. We asked Pulaski, celebrity manicuristSkyy Hadley, and Christy Harpring, co-owner ofSea Salt and Sugar Nail Bar in Savannah, Georgia, to clue us in on gelpolish mistakes to avoid.\n\n## 1. You’re getting gel manicures back-to-back.\n\nSince removing and applying gel nail polish can cause a lot of wear and tear on your nails, you should space out your manicures. “By getting gel nails every two weeks consistently, the nail plate gets extremely suffocated,” explains Hadley. This can lead to nail dehydration and eventually breakage, so make sure to give your nails downtime between gels. “It’s important to have a professional nail technician assess your nail health between applications to determine if your nails could use a sabbatical from polishes,” explains Harpring.\n\n## 2. You’re leaving gel polish on too long.\n\nSince gel nail polish can be worn for weeks on end without even the tiniest chip, stretching the life of your manicure is tempting. However, Hadley suggests removing a gel manicure after two to three weeks maximum to avoid damaging nail beds and cuticles. Harpring agrees, adding that overextending gel manicures can not only lead to weakened nails, but also introduce potentially harmful bacteria. “It is important to remember that once the gel begins to lift, it does allow for moisture to get under the gel and possibly lead to bacterial growth,” explains Harpring.\n\n## 3. You’re removing an old gel manicure without professional help.\n\nOnce a gel manicure is on its last leg, you may be tempted toremove it yourself, but experts advise against it. “The safest way to remove gel polish is by a professional,” says Harpring.\n\nIf you absolutely can’t make it to the salon for removal, she advises you first gently file the top of the polish to remove the shine, which allows the acetone to penetrate and dissolve the gel easier. Next, soak cotton balls in acetone (a chemical commonly used in gel nail polish removal), apply a cotton ball to each nail, and wrap it in tin foil. Leave the wraps on for 10 to 15 minutes, and then, using a wooden cuticle pusher, gently push the gel off of the nail plates. To finish, lightly buff the surface of the nail with a buffing tool, and apply oil to your nails and cuticles to rehydrate.\n\n## 4. You’re not using cuticle oil.\n\nAccording to Hadley, you can assess nail damage based on their flexibility: Normal nails are somewhat flexible, but the harder and sturdier the nail, the more likely it is to break. Sincecold weather tends to make skin drier overall, proper cuticle hydration can make a big difference. Additionally, acetone can be extremely drying to the nail bed, causing nails to break or become brittle over time.\n\nTo combat nail dryness, experts suggest keeping cuticle oil close at hand (no pun intended). “I swear by cuticle oil and personally loveNCLA\'s,” Pulaski tells SELF. “I used to think that cuticle oil wasn\'t essential, but I started using it about two years ago and I always carry it with me now, especially in the colder months!” Adding a few drops of oil to your nails and cuticles in between salon visits will keep them hydrated.\n\nKeeping my nails looking good, with or without polish, is definitely a priority. So while I probably won’t give up on gel nail polish altogether, I’ll definitely think twice before trying to stretch mymanicure for longer than two weeks at a time.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '/resources/images/woman-getting-manicure.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/gel-nail-polish-mistakes', 0, 0);

That just sounded weird.\n\nTurns out, she wasn’t talking about helping your nail polish dry faster (which, actually,doesn’t work, she was talking about preventing foot fungus.\n\nLippman informs me that she actually got the tip from her podiatrist, Ivar Roth, D.P.M., M.P.H., of Concierge Podiatry and Spa. \"Using a blow-dryer is something that I came up with to combat fungus infections of the feet and nails,\" Dr. Roth tells SELF. The rationale is simple, he explains. Fungi grow in moist environments; take away the water, and it helps to stop growth.\n\nWhen you let your feet air-dry, it can take up to 30 minutes for the corners of yournails and the spaces between your toes to dry—these are the places where fungus often begins to grow, Dr. Roth says. Blow-drying cuts that down to around a minute or so, which means there’s less time for fungus to grow, and therefore less chance you’ll walk out of your bathroom or the gym locker room with a budding case ofathlete’s foot.\n\n(Note, if you have decreased sensation to pain or temperature in your toes, fromdiabetic neuropathy or other causes, don\'t try this at home—you could risk burning your skin.)\n\nNYC sports podiatrist Lori Weisenfeld tells SELF the method makes sense. “Fungi like warm, dark places, which is why it’s important to dry between and under toes,” she says. “Your feet dry quickly—it’s between and under toes that act as a reservoir for moisture and fungus.” Yet, she says, many people tend to neglect drying the areas between and under toes after bathing. Dr. Weisenfeld has never advised patients to use a blow-dryer, but always recommends they use a tissue as opposed to their body towel when drying their feet, as using the same towel could potentially spread fungus.\n\nThe standard advice for preventing foot fungus, according to theAmerican Podiatric Medical Association, is to wear shoes that aren’t too tight to provide air flow to feet, as well as changing shoes and socks regularly to keep your feet dry. And if you shower at the gym, you’ll want to invest in a pair ofshower shoes.\n\nOne of the first signs you may be dealing with possible foot fungus? Small white spots on your toe nails. \"White spots on the nails or any signs of discoloration or thickening of the nail could be a sign that you may be dealing with a fungus or mold,\" says Dr. Roth. \"Other signs are scaly/dry skin on the foot, which can indicate skin fungus.\" According to podiatrist Emily Splichal, many patients believe think their skin just is dry when they actually have a fungal infection. Try an over-the-counter antifungal—and if you don\'t see an improvement within two weeks, consult a podiatrist.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '/resources/images/hair-dryer.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/why-you-might-want-to-blow-dry-your-toes', 0, 0);

Even if you’re a DIY pro, at-home manicures never seems to last as long as when the actual pros do it. The simple solution would be to go to the nail salon, but that’s not always time or cost efficient. I decided to talk to six professional manicurists to get their insider tips for a better at-home mani.\n\nIt turns out I was committing a few common faux pas that shorten the lifespan of my mani. And apparently there are a lot of BS tips out there (why am I not surprised…). For example, that trick where you dunk your freshly-painted nails in ice water to quick dry—false. Now, I’m wondering what else I have been doing wrong.\n\nHere are nine ways to keep your nails looking perfect when you DIY your manicure, according to the nail experts.\n\n\\1. Select the right shape.\n\nDespite all the trendy shapes (like the coffin or the stiletto), it turns out that rounded nails are your best bet to avoid rips and snagging. “Due to it’s smooth shape, it’s less likely to catch on things,” says Essie’s global lead educator Rita Remark. “If you prefer to wear your nails square, just make sure to round the edges on either side of the nail.”\n\n\\2. Make sure to buff the edge of your nails.\n\nOnce you land on the final shape, it’s important to make sure nothing is left hanging on the edge. “When nails are filed quite a bit, it\'s important to use a nail buffer to get all remaining nail debris out from under the nail and from the sides of the nail along the cuticle line,” says Carly Narva, a manicure enthusiast and the VP of merchandising at beauty retailer Violet Grey. Another pro tip: Make sure to file in one direction especially with the sides—this ensures you aren’t disturbing the fibers of the nails.\n\n\\3. Prep your nails properly before you paint.\n\nMost nail salons sit you to soak before pushing the cuticles and filing, but the pros say dry manis are more sanitary and help your polish last longer. Remark says soaking in water causes the nail to expand. Then when it dries the nail contracts, causing your polish to chip. Instead, she says, cleanse the nails with nail polish remover or alcohol before polishing.\n\nSome salons will use vinegar for a pre-mani soak, but that’s also a no-go, according to editorial nail technician Honey, who explains that the acid in vinegar could make your nails brittle. “I use vinegar on feet to make sure there is no bacteria, but not usually on the hands. A dry manicure is best,” she says.\n\n\\4. Don’t shake the nail polish bottle.\n\nWe’ve heard this tip time and time again, yet many of us continue to shake our nail polish when it’s separated, and then wonder why we don’t end up with a seamless manicure. “I prefer rolling the polish if I\'m polishing nails immediately,” explains celebrity manicurist for Kiss products, Gina Edwards. Many bottles have a small metal ball inside that helps stir the product around. “Shaking creates bubbles in the polish and can be seen if you apply shortly after,” she says, adding that if you do shake, you should wait an hour before you polish.\n\nHoney uses a roll-and-shake combo. “Some people say not to shake or roll because it makes bubbles in the polish, but I do a combination of the two at the start of a manicure,” she explains. “By the time I am ready to use the color, the bubbles have settled.”\n\n\\5. Two thinner coats are better than one thick coat.\n\nWhile it’s tempting to go for the gusto with one thick coat, don’t. Globs of polish just means longer drying time and a higher risk for smudging. “Thick coats are a no-go!” exclaims nail styling artist Gracie J. “Thin and even coats work best for a seamless look.”\n\nCelebrity manicurist Sarah Chue breaks it down a bit further. “Many thin coats will allow polish to dry in between—use only three layers max of color,” she says. “In general, one layer of base coat, two coats of color, and one layer top coat. Sometimes if you\'d like more pigment or the color seems a bit sheer, a third coat of color is tolerable.”\n\nRemark agrees. “Almost any polish you’ll find on the market is formulated to be polished with two coats, so use this as a rule of thumb for polishing at home,” she says, adding, “if the polish texture is sheer, oftentimes it will look good even with one coat. However, if it’s an opaque color, it will absolutely require at least two coats.”\n\n\\6. Apply product in three strokes.\n\nOne swipe and you’re out? Not so fast. “The professional way to apply is middle then sides,” says Edwards. “However, as long as you get full coverage on the nail, it\'s really a comfort level for the individual.”\n\n\\7. Avoid heat when drying your mani.\n\nAs for drying, air-dry or use a blast of cold—not hot—air to assist. “Heat actually keeps your polish from firming. Cold air does the opposite,” says Chue. “[If you’re in a rush], try quick-dry drops after a few minutes of drying.” For her at-home manicure, Narva likes to wait 5 to 10 minutes and use one drop of Tenoverten\'s Non-Toxic Quick Dry Drops ($18) on each nail, holding hands facing downward so the drop covers the entire nail.\n\n\\8. Fix mistakes ASAP.\n\nGot a little overzealous with polish? It’s a quick fix. “Use a stick with a flat edge, dip it in acetone, and work it around the eponychium after each nail,” explains Gracie J (eponychium is the cuticle area). “That way you don’t wait until the end, when the polish has already dried up in the crevices.”\n\nFor smudges, you can gently use your finger to push polish back into place before adding a layer of top coat. “If it’s beyond fixing, like when you get those dents, it’s best to just wipe it off and re-do,” Gracie J adds.\n\n\\9. Make manicure maintenance an everyday thing.\n\nAfter all your hard work, a few good habits can extend the life of a DIY manicure. “I always recommend that my clients wear gloves when washing dishes or cleaning the house,” shares Gracie J. “I also tell them to use cuticle oil. It helps keep the skin around your nails healthy and promotes healthy nail growth.”\n\nNarva is a huge fan of hand creams—two of her favorites are from Omorovicza and Tatcha. “Both are super hydrating but do not leave an oily finish,” she says.\n\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '/resources/images/woman-doing-her-manicure.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/ways-to-not-ruin-your-at-home-manicure', 0, 0);

Finding the perfectnude nail polish is something that frustrates me every time I go to the salon. Standing in front of that big wall of bottles, I go for the classic shades like Essie Ballet Slippers, but those cotton candy colors don\'t quite mesh with my milk chocolate skin. It\'s not the right nude for me.\n\nThat’s why I reached out to celebrity and editorial manicuristJackie Saulsbery, who has worked with stars like Adele, to put an end to my search once and for all.\n\n“Nude can be several different shades depending on the skin tone,” Saulsbery says. But there are other things to consider, too. “When you’re picking a color, see if you want something to draw the eyes to the hands or if you want something to blend in.” Nude doesn’t have to be boring. You can pick a shade with a grayundertone or something with a touch of shimmer to liven it up.\n\nWith her help, I found my new favorite nude shade (Zoya Pasha, see below), and got her tips to help nail down a nude polish for every complexion—plus application advice for a flawless DIY nude manicure.\n\nSaulsbery has tips to help find a nude polish for every complexion.\n\nFor Fair Skin:\n\n![This image may contain Finger Hand Human and Person](/resources/images/062917_SELF45106.jpg)\n\nKatie Thompson\n\nSaulsbery warns to stay away from pink if you have a fair complexion because it can make skin look ashy or pasty. Instead, look for variations of taupe that are more opaque. Make sure to ask the manicurist if the nail colors on the polish wall are “what you see is what you get.” Sometimes what the color looks like in the bottle doesn’t translate the same on the hand. So be prepared to test a few options.\n\n**On model:** Essie Nail Polish in Sand Tropez ($9,essie.com)\n\n![Image may contain Cosmetics and Bottle](/resources/images/1_nude.jpg)\n\n**Similar shades:** Dior Vernis Nail Lacquer in Palais Royal ($27,sephora.com); CND Vinylux Weekly Polish in Powder My Nose ($11,loxabeauty.com); Zoya Nail Polish in Tatum ($10,zoya.com)\n\nFor Medium Skin:\n\n![Image may contain Human Person Text and Hand](/resources/images/062917_SELF45112.jpg)\n\nKatie Thompson\n\nWhile pink can wash out fair skin, it blends right in on olive skin types.

You can try a polish with a hint of rose if you’re looking for something work appropriate or go for a gray undertone if you’re looking to make it a bit more exciting.\n\n**On model:** Zoya Nail Polish in Pasha ($10,zoya.com)\n\n![Image may contain Cosmetics](/resources/images/3_nude.jpg)\n\n**Similar shades:** Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nail Polish in Totem-ly Yours ($7,target.com); Dior Vernis Nail Lacquer in Incognito ($27,sephora.com); OPI Nail Lacquer in Icelanded a Bottle of OPI ($6,beyondpolish.com)\n\nFor Deep Skin:\n\n![Image may contain Hand Human Person and Finger](/resources/images/062917_SELF45055.jpg)\n\nKatie Thompson\n\nLight, cloudy colors can make nails look fake on dark skin.

Then gently push back the skin around the base of thenail. Instead of cutting your cuticles, Saulsbery recommends using a buffing block to remove the excess skin. Then shape the tip of the nail by brushing a file from corner to center. Make sure to get underneath the free nail as well to get rid of any excess dust under the free edge, which can show up through sheer nude formulas.\n\nBefore applying a basecoat you want to dehydrate the nail with polish remover and rubbing alcohol to get rid of any oil. This helps the manicure last longer. Saulsbery uses theOrly Top2Bottom ($10) as a base and topcoat. “With the nude, you want to make sure that the base is completely dry before you apply the color because nude can drag and it’ll be streaky,” she says. “Then, you find yourself applying coat after coat trying to darken it when all you have to do is just wait a second for the base to dry.”\n\nSaulsbery also uses a special technique to apply polish: First move the brush across the base of the nail from side to side to even out the color near the cuticle. Then pull the color down from base to tip in three strokes. That way you get full coverage without any spots or streaks.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-11 13:30:52', '/resources/images/062917_SELF45139.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/nude-nail-polish-skin-tone', 0, 0);

This article is for those that are looking for reasons to keep drinking it.\n\nAfter all, you may have a caffeine-hater in your life. You know the type – they’re always telling you what’s bad for your health.\n\nHere’s a list of some good reasons to drink coffee. Memorize this list – so the next time you encounter your favorite coffee-hater you can pull out one of these babies.\n\nWhile you’re at it, you can add the words “*from a peer-reviewed scientific journal*” — that’ll really get your pet coffee-hater frothing at the mouth.\n\n**In all seriousness, here are some scientific reasons for drinking coffee in moderation.**\n\n## Top 11 Coffee Health Benefits\n\n1. **Cut the Pain**\n   Two cups of coffee can cut post-workout muscle pain by up to 48%. *From the Journal of Pain, March 2007 (link)*\n2. **Increase your fiber intake**\n   A cup of brewed coffee represents a contribution of up to 1.8 grams of fiber of the recommended intake of 20-38 grams. *From the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry (link).*\n3. **Protection against cirrhosis of the liver**\n   Of course, you could just cut down on the alcohol intake. *From the Archives of Internal Medicine (link)*. Another more recent study also showed coffee’s liver protecting benefits. link. Yet another study showed that both coffee and decaffeinated coffee lowered the liver enzyme levels of coffee drinkers. This study was published in the Hepatology Journal.\n4. **Lowered risk of Type 2 Diabetes**\n   Those who consumed 6 or more cups per day had a 22% lower risk of diabetes. *From the Archives of Internal Medicine (link)*. A recent review of research conducted by Harvard’s Dr. Frank Hu showed that the risk of type II diabetes decreases by 9% for each daily cup of coffee consumed. Decaf coffee decreased risk by 6% per cup.\n5. **Lowered risk of Alzheimer’s disease**\n   There is considerable evidence that caffeine may protect against Alzheimer’s disease. *From the European Journal of Neurology (link).*\n6. **Reduces suicide risk and Depression**\n   A 10-year study of 86,000 female nurses shows a reduced risk of suicide in the coffee drinkers. *From the Archives of Internal Medicine (link)*. Another study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that women who drink 4 or more cups of coffee were 20% less likely to suffer from depression. *Study link*.\n7. **Protection against Parkinson’s**People with Parkinson’s disease are less likely to be smokers and coffee drinkers than their healthy siblings. Just make sure you don’t get lung cancer on the way. *From the Archives of Neurology (link).* Even newer research out of Sweden revealed that drinking coffee reduces the risk of Parkinson’s even when genetic factors come into play. \n8. **Coffee drinkers have less risk of heart disease.** Korean researchers found that study participants who consumed 3 to 5 cups of coffee a day were less likely to show the beginning signs of heart disease. The study. *Other dietary factors should also be noted as Koreans typically have a different diet than do Westerners. *A more recent study conducted in Brazil found that those that consume at least three cups of coffee a day tend to develop less calcification in their coronary arteries.\n9. **Coffee drinkers have stronger DNA**. A study published in the European Journal of Nutrition showed that coffee drinkers have DNA with stronger integrity since the white blood cells of coffee drinkers had far less instance of spontaneous DNA strand breakage. Study abstract.\n10. **Lower Risk of Multiple Sclerosis**. Recent research showed that at least 4 cups of coffee a day may help protect against the development and reoccurrence of MS. It is believed that the coffee prevents the neural inflammation that possibly leads to the disease developing. The study was published in the* Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry.*\n11. **Coffee reduces colorectal cancer risk**. Even moderate consumption of coffee can reduce the odds of developing colorectal cancer by 26%. This protective benefit increases with more consumption. The study is described in detail here.\n\n> Recent research has also shown that coffee may boost a woman’s sex drive, but the fact that it’s only been tested on rats somehow takes the shine off.\n\n### Even More Reasons to Drink Coffee…\n\nNew research concerning coffee and health is being conducted all the time. Here are some more of the latest studies.\n\n1. **Reduced Liver Cancer Risk:** Researchers at USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center found that those that consume 1-3 cups of coffee a day have a 29% reduced risk of developing liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the most common type. Src.\n2. **Less Gout Risk:** Yet another reason: Risk for developing gout (in men) decreases with increasing coffee consumption. This is a large study of over 50,000 men (link).\n3. **Longevity:** Greek boiled coffee linked to longevity and heart health. –link. Another study published in the June 17, 2008, issue of the *Annals of Internal Medicine *howed that women who consume coffee had a lower risk of death from cancer, heart disease, and other factors, which therefore promotes a longer lifespan. Yet another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that coffee drinkers were at less risk of dying prematurely from diseases like diabetes, heart disease and forms of cancer. *Study link*. Another study from Japan found that men who drink at least 3 cups of coffee per day have a 24% less risk of dying early from disease. Yet another study from Harvard also confirmed that those who drink 1-5 cups of coffee a day avoid diseases linked to premature death. The study. A Japanese-based study also found similar results when it comes to coffee and longevity. The study. Two more 2017 research studies have confirmed what earlier studies have found. Those that drink coffee live longer than those who don’t. The American study is found here and the European-based study is found here.\n4. **Prevents Retinal Damage**. A Cornell University Study showed that coffee may prevent retinal damage due to oxidative stress. Caffeine isn’t the culprit here, but chlorogenic acid (CLA), which is one of the strong antioxidants found in the coffee bean. link\n5. **Black coffee prevents cavities**. Researchers out of Brazil found that strong black coffee kills the bacteria on teeth that leads to tooth decay. Adding milk or sugar to coffee negates this benefit. –link\n6. **Coffee may protect against periodontal disease**. As part of the US Department of Veterans Affairs Dental Longitudinal Study coffee consumption and dental health among 1,152 men was tracked from 1968-1998. The researchers found that coffee didn’t promote gum disease and actually showed a protective benefit. Link\n7. **Coffee may protect against melanoma**. A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that melanoma risk decreases with coffee consumption and that this risk decreases with each cup consumed. *Study link*.\n8. **The USDA’s new 2015 dietary guidelines recommend it for better health**. They advise people that having 3 to 5 cups of coffee a day is good for their overall health and reduces the risk of disease. However, they report that adding sugar, cream, or flavored creamers quickly negates the potential benefits. The complete report here.(pdf)\n9. **Reduced heart attack mortality risk**. Researchers found that those who drink two or more cups of coffee daily after having a heart attack have the least risk of dying from the heart attack. The study.\n10. **Helps people get along with co-workers better.** A study published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology showed that workers/ workplaces who consume coffee have a more positive view of self and others than do workers/ workspaces that do not consume coffee. Coffee consumption also enhanced participation in workplace group activities.\n\n## Coffee’s Health Promoting Antioxidants\n\nCoffee Berries\n\nCoffee’s health promoting properties are likely due to the antioxidants naturally occurring in the coffee bean.\n\n- A typical serving of coffee contains **more antioxidants** than typical serving**s** of grape juice, blueberries, raspberries, and oranges.\n- Antioxidants in coffee may dampen inflammation, reducing the risk of disorders related to it, like cardiovascular disease.\n- A study from Monash University even further demonstrated the antioxidant capacities of brewed coffee.\n\n**Just drink decaf then?**\n\nWhile there are still some health benefits to drinking decaf coffee, most of the above studies showed that caffeinated coffee had the greatest benefits.\n\nThis is due to many of the antioxidants being removed during the decaffeination process.\n\n### How Safe or Beneficial is Coffee Then?\n\nFor most people, coffee can be a healthy part of the diet. It is fine to enjoy a couple of cups a day unless you can’t control your consumption.\n\nHowever, coffee may not be beneficial for everyone. Those with certain heart conditions, caffeine sensitivity, and woman who are pregnant should stick to decaf or tea.\n\nAlso, those that drink coffee in excess may be negating some of the benefits because of the large amounts of caffeine they are consuming. These people may benefit from a caffeine detox to reset their caffeine tolerance to more moderate levels.\n\nThe key is moderation, which is typically 2-3 cups a day, to get the coffee health benefits but avoid the negative issues associated with too much caffeine.', 0, '2021-03-11 16:49:49', '2021-03-11 16:49:50', '/resources/images/Reasons-to-drink-coffee-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/7-good-reasons-to-drink-coffee.html', 1, 0);

(Understanding your Total Daily Energy Expenditure andtracking what you eat for awhile is even better.\n\nThe most obvious way to make your coffee less calorific is to simply switch to black coffee, however, this is easier said than done. Many just don’t like drinking black coffee. Here are some tips to enjoy a creamy coffee but with fewer calories.\n\n1. **Ask for 2% or skim milk when ordering your coffee drink**. Many coffee shops use whole milk by default.\n2. **Use lactose-free milk:** Lactose is the sugar in milk but the human tongue doesn’t taste lactose as very sweet. When companies sell lactose-free milk, they simply add the lactase enzyme to milk which breaks down the lactose into simpler sugars which your tongue can better taste. When you use lactose-free milk, the coffee will naturally taste sweeter even though the sugar content hasn’t changed.\n3. **Ask for sugar-free flavorings and syrups.** These have come a long way over the years and many taste great without adding calories.\n4. **Avoid the ice cream based coffee drinks.** These are much higher in calories than frozen coffee drinks that use crushed ice.\n5. **Don’t be afraid of cream.** Adding a tablespoon of cream to your brewed 12 fl oz coffee only adds 52 calories while a Tall Starbucks Latte is 180 calories. If you like a creamy coffee choose a brewed coffee or an Americano with cream instead of a milk-based espresso drink.\n\nBeyond the negative effects that all those calories have on maintaining a healthy weight, the excess sugar in many coffee drinks is also a menace to one’s health.\n\nMore and moreresearch shows that eating large amounts of sugar is linked to all kinds of diseases.\n\n', 0, '2021-03-11 16:52:07', '2021-03-11 16:52:09', '/resources/images/Calorie-Laden-Coffees-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/coffees-with-crazy-calories.html', 1, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (92, 12, 'Coffee Lovers Diet: The Key to Health and Weight Loss?', 'Dr. Arnott\'s The Coffee Diet claims that if people change the way they drink coffee, they can change their lives. Is this true or just marketing hyperbole?', '![the coffee lovers diet by Dr. Bob Arnot](/resources/images/coffee-lovers-diet-Arnott.jpg)\n\nWe recently stumbled across a new book calledThe Coffee Lover’s Diet: Change Your Coffee, Change Your Life and were instantly intrigued by the concept.\n\nThe book’s author isDr. Bob Arnot, who is a physician and was previously a medical correspondent for TV networks such as NBC and CBS. His idea for writing the book came from his investigation on theIkarians who are some of the oldest living people on the planet and the coffee that they typically drink.\n\nThey drink coffee differently than most people in the west. Their coffee isGreek coffee which is finely ground and boiled before serving. This coupled with their lifestyle and a Mediterranean diet is believed to be the source of their longevity.\n\n### Change Your Coffee, Change Your Life?\n\nDr. Arnot believes that if westerners change the way they drink their coffee, they too can help unlock coffee’s true potential for delivering better health and longevity.\n\nHe believes this starts by selecting the right coffee beans and the right roast.High-phenol (high-antioxidant) beans should be selected and they should only be lightly roasted so that they retain the most phenols.¹\n\nThe next step is to prepare the coffee similar to the Greeks. Grind the beans correctly, use the best water temperature for extraction, and favor methods that have a longer extraction time.\n\nHowever, people should avoid using sugar or dairy in their coffee and he believes they won’t miss it since high-phenol coffee tastes much better black than does the poor quality coffee most people are used to drinking.\n\nDr. Arnot believes that if people start drinking coffee this way they will notice dramatic changes in their moods, energy levels, and overall better health.\n\n### His Study\n\nIn conjunction with Dr. David Nieman fromNorth Carolina Reseach Campus, a double-blind placebo-controlled trial was developed to test the effectiveness of high phenol coffee.\n\nAccording to the first chapter of the book, one group of participants were given high-phenol caffeinated coffee and the other where given low-phenol decaffeinated coffee (placebo). They continued using either for 2 weeks. After a short washout period, the two groups were given the opposite sample for two weeks.\n\nThe participants’ TDM (total mood disturbance) was then measured before and 30 minutes after the dose. Those that consumed the high-phenol caffeinated coffee reported energy, liveliness, and more positive mood.\n\n### The Diet\n\nAs far as dietary recommendations to lose weight the book is pretty standard. Dr. Arnot starts by explaining how high-phenol coffee and caffeine in general aid in fat loss byspeeding up the metabolism and by helping the body utilize stored fat for energy.\n\nBesides drinking high-quality coffee, a diet rich in plant-based foods is encouraged, as well as some lean protein. Many ofthe principles of the Mediterranean diet are recommended. By avoiding processed foods, added sugar and other refined carbs, dieters will naturally reduce their calorie intake and lose weight.\n\n### Problems With The Coffee Lover’s Diet?\n\nThe most glaringly obvious problem with the diet is his faulty study. He had one group consume caffeinated high-phenol coffee and the other group (placebo) consume decaffeinated low-phenol coffee. Anyone who has ever studiedthe scientific method knows that a valid study can only test for ONE variable at a time. His study actually had TWO variables; caffeine and phenols (CGA).\n\nHe should have used caffeinated high-phenol coffee and a placebo of caffeinated low-phenol coffee as his placebo. Of course, the people who had the caffeinated coffee were going to report better mood, energy, and productivity since that’s what caffeine does. The decaf group, of course, weregoing to feel lousy especially if they had previously been caffeinated coffee drinkers…\n\nDr. Arnot sells his own brand of high-phenol coffee (Dr. Danger Coffee), so there is a potential conflict of interest. Arnot has alsofiled a patent on the high-phenol method of making coffee.\n\nI wouldn’t argue that high-phenol coffee is better for one’s health than low-phenol coffee because antioxidants are one of the key factors in coffee’s health promoting effects, but people would notice these benefits over time, not immediately.\n\nDr. Arnot says that people feel better immediately after his coffee when compared to the their normal coffee drink. The problem with that logic is that Greek style coffee also has more caffeine per ounce than western brewed coffee. So if people suddenly switch from one to the other, they will feel a difference because of the caffeine levels.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that traditionally both Greek andTurkish-style coffee are served with sugar and can be pretty sweet. I would assume that the Ikarians also consumed their coffee this way (although cannot verify this).\n\n## Final Conclusions\n\nHealthy eating and getting more antioxidants through natural products like coffee does have a positive influence on one’s mind, weight, and longevity. But, Dr. Arnot’s diet would have a little more credibility if he didn’t have his own brand of coffee attached to it and if he conducted scientifically valid studies to support his theory.\n\nIf you love coffee, it can be part of a healthy diet and if nothing else, the book does show people how to get the mosthealth benefits out of their coffee by altering their brewing technique as well as selecting higher quality coffees.\n\nThere’s also no reason why a person can’t add a little cream and sugar to their coffee if desired. This doesn’t change the antioxidant factor of the coffee and typically adds only a few calories. It’s far more important for people to cut out sugary drinks like soda and even fruit juice than it would be to skip the teaspoon of sugar and splash of cream in their coffee.\n\n', 0, '2021-03-11 16:53:04', '2021-03-11 16:53:06', '/resources/images/coffee-lovers-diet-Arnott-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/coffee-lovers-diet.html', 0, 0);

Here\'s how you can prevent this.', 'Caffeine is prized because it combats sleep and feeling tired, but this can be a double-edged sword.\n\n![sleep and caffeine](/resources/images/cant-sleep.jpg)\n\nCaffeine can actually prevent people from getting a good night’s sleep1, which means that even more caffeine is needed the following morning to feel functional.\n\n**This can become a vicious cycle if a caffeine user isn’t careful.**\n\n*Here’s how you can be sure to not let caffeine rob you of your precious sleep.*\n\n## How Caffeine Prevents Sleep\n\nCaffeine primarily prevents sleep byblocking adenosine receptors in the brain. Basically, adenosine is the neurotransmitter that signals the brain that the body is tired and in need of rest.\n\nCaffeine fits nicely into these receptors and prevents adenosine from doing its job. As long as there is a steady supply of caffeine flooding the receptors, sleep will be hampered.\n\nSome may still be able to fall asleep even though caffeine is still blocking the adenosine receptors, but this sleep is usually shallow and restless.\n\n### Caffeine Disrupts Circadian Rhythm\n\nNot only does caffeine block adenosine receptors, but if it is consumed too close to bedtime, it can throw a person’s entire circadian rhythm off.\n\nResearchers from theMRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology7 in the UK found that when study participants were given 200 mg of caffeine 3 hours prior to bedtime, the caffeine delayed their normal circadian sleep pattern by 40 minutes. Participants who also were exposed to bright light along with the caffeine had their sleep cycle delayed by 105 minutes.\n\n**Not only does this affect how well you fall asleep but also how good you feel the next morning.**\n\n### Why Sleep Is Important\n\nFor humans, sleep is a necessity.2 Sleep is when much of your body’s repair and rejuvenation processes take place. Adults should get 7-8 hours of sleep a night and children still developing should get 9+ hours of sleep each night.\n\nIn fact, one of the main reasons excessive caffeine isn’t recommended for children is because sleep is so vital for proper brain development and caffeine can interfere with the duration and quality of sleep a child needs to get.3\n\nLack of quality sleep is also linked to obesity, mental illness, high blood pressure, and stress.4 Therefore, it is crucial that you get plenty of rest if you want to be in the best health that you can be.\n\n![sleep and good health](/resources/images/healthy-sleep.jpg)\n\n## How To Stop Caffeine From Stealing Your Sleep\n\nUnfortunately, caffeine and lack of sleep all too often form a vicious cycle. People often consume caffeine because they don’t get enough sleep and then caffeine prevents them from getting the amount and quality of sleep they require to feel awake and energized.\n\n>Active Edge has developed a sleep shirt that uses low-wave frequency technology to improve the quality of sleep. This could also be something to try if caffeine is affecting your quality of sleep.\n\nHowever, there are some steps that you can take to break the cycle and still get adequate sleep while using caffeine. Really heavy caffeine usersmay benefit from a caffeine detox prior to these steps in order to reset their tolerance to caffeine.\n\n**First, don’t consume caffeine too late in the afternoon.**5 If you want to get to bed at 10, then you should probably avoid caffeine after 12 noon. If at noon you consumed 200 mg of caffeine, based oncaffeine’s half-life of 5.7 hours, you would still have over 50 mg in your system at 10 pm.\n\nPlus, this doesn’t account for any caffeine you consumed earlier in the day, which is also still being processed. If you havea high sensitivity orlow built up tolerance to caffeine you may need to stop your consumption even earlier.\n\n**Secondly, know your personal safe daily dose of caffeine and avoid having more than that.** You can find this by usingour caffeine calculator, but for most people it is between 300-400 mg per day. Insomnia is one ofthe leading caffeine overdose symptoms and can prevent you from getting the sleep you need.\n\n**Finally, don’t consume caffeine as soon as you wake up in the morning.** Research shows6 that caffeine works best when taken 1-2 hours after waking. When we first wake up, our bodies are in a natural awakening state.\n\nIf you wait and consume caffeine after this awakening state is wearing off, it will be much more effective in helping you feel alert and productive. Additionally, it will help keep you from consuming too much caffeine, which would interfere with your sleep the following night.\n\n![tired](/resources/images/4896025102_1fb83becf3_o.jpg)\n\n### Signs Caffeine is Preventing Sleep\n\nIf you aren’t sleeping well and aren’t sure whether caffeine is interfering with your sleep or not, here are some things to look for.\n\n1. Do you have trouble falling asleep?\n2. Do you fall asleep but wake back up shortly after?\n3. Do you sleep but wake up often throughout the night?\n4. Do you toss and turn a lot while you sleep?\n5. Do you often use sleeping pills to help you get to sleep?\n\nThese all can be indicators that the caffeine still in your system is preventing you from sleeping properly. If you can identify with any of these, you should take the steps mentioned above to more properly manage your caffeine consumption.\n\nWhile caffeine can be useful for helping us be more alert and productive during our busy lives, it can interfere with our sleep. By practicing a little caffeine hygiene, you will be promoting better sleep hygiene as well.', 0, '2021-03-11 17:03:47', '2021-03-11 17:03:51', '/resources/images/cant-sleep-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/caffeine-and-sleep.html', 0, 0);

We outline 10 of the caffeine-coffee-cancer studies conducted.', '![cancer-caffeine-coffee](/resources/images/cancer-caffeine-coffee.jpg)\n\n### Does Coffee Cause or Prevent Cancer?\n\nJust decades ago doctors and health professionals were warning about the dangers of having too much coffee because of therisk that caffeine was thought to have on the body.\n\nHowever, the last decade has shed a lot of light onthe health benefits of coffee and its relationship to cancer.\n\nMany decade or more long studies have been coming to a close and the results have been changing everything the medical profession thought they knew about coffee and how it influences the risks of getting cancer.\n\nStudy after study has been showing the cancer fighting properties of coffee because of the rich antioxidants it contains.\n\nIn fact, with most studies we aren’t just talking a cup or two a day since most studies show greater benefit when four or more caffeinated coffees are consumed daily.\n\n## Recent Caffeine, Coffee, and Cancer Studies\n\nHere are just a few of the studies that support the notion that caffeinated coffee reduces risk of certain types of cancer.\n\n1. **Oral Cancer:**More than 4 cups of coffee a day decrease oral and head cancers by 39%.\n2. **Uterine Cancer:** Woman who drink more than two cups of coffee a day have less chance of uterine cancer.\n3. **Prostate Cancer:**Men who have 6 cups of coffee a day reduce their prostate cancer risk by 60%.\n4. **Brain Cancer:**At least 5 cups of coffee prevents certain types of brain cancer by 40%.\n5. **Colon Cancer:**At least 2 cups of coffee a day can cut colon cancer risk. A newer study showed that colon cancer patients who drank four or more servings of coffee a day were 42% less likely to have bowel cancer recurrence after surgery and treatment. This study was conducted by theDana-Farber Cancer Institute. An evennewer study also supported this previous research regarding the reduced risk of colorectal cancer among coffee drinkers.\n6. **Breast Cancer:**At least 3 cups of coffee a day can prevent or delay the onset of certain types of breast cancer. Another study showed that at least 2 cups of coffee consumed along side the breast cancer drug tamoxifen, resulted in 49% less early breast cancer recurrence among breast cancer patients in Sweden.\n7. **Liver Cancer:**Coffee drinkers have 41% less instance of liver cancer. A more recent study showed that 1-3 cups of coffee a day reduces risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma by 29%.Link\n8. **Endometrial Cancer**: Women who consume at least 3 cups of coffee a day have a 19% decreased risk of developing endometrial cancer, which claims the lives of about 10,000 women in the USA each year.The research.\n9. **Caffeine protects against lung cancer**. A new study published in the Experimental Hematology & Oncology journal showed that caffeine inhibits a couple of proteins found in lung cancer cells, which in turn prevents the cell’s growth and reproduction.The study.\n10. **Skin Cancer**: A recent study published in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that caffeinated coffee drinkers were less likely to develop melanoma. The more coffee people consumed the less risk was observed.Study abstract.\n\n### Caffeinated Coffee as Part of a Healthy Diet\n\nWhile the coffee/cancer research isn’t definitive, it does reveal that drinking coffee is probably far more beneficial than harmful as long as the person canmetabolize caffeine correctly and doesn’t suffer from acaffeine allergy or fromexcessive use.\n\nIn most of the studies, it was found that decaffeinated coffee didn’t appear to have the same effect, which is probably due to the decaffeinating process removing many of the antioxidants.\n\nHowever, we would suspect that people who eat poor quality food and engage in unhealthy habits such as smoking and excessive drinking would not likely experience the cancer fighting properties coffee has to offer.\n\nBut, coffee as part of a healthy diet rich in fresh vegetables and fruit will most likely have the greatest anticancer benefits.\n\nPeople should also note that because ofthe caffeine in coffee, moderation is also recommended and less than 400mg of caffeine from all sources a day seems to bea safe level for most healthy adults.\n\nThe World Health Organization recently removed coffee from their list of possible carcinogens. They cited that there is an overwhelming amount of research that coffee can promote health and actually inhibit cancer. However, they did note that drinking coffee at temperatures in excess of 140 degrees Fahrenheit can increase the risk of cancers of the throat and esophagus. This temperature is much higher than which coffee is typically consumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n', 0, '2021-03-11 17:21:00', '2021-03-11 17:21:02', '/resources/images/coffee-prevents-cancer.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/caffeinated-coffee-the-anti-cancer-wonder-drug.html', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (95, 12, 'Caffeine and Dehydration: What the Research Says', 'What the research says about the dehydrating effect of caffeine. It can act as a diuretic, but only in certain circumstances. Here\'s what you should know.', 'There seems to be a lot of confusion as to whether or not caffeine causes dehydration.\n\n![dehydration and caffeine](/resources/images/restrooms.jpg)\n\nThis stems mainly from caffeine’s classification as a diuretic, but to determine the overall dehydrating effect of caffeine, there are a few other factors involved.\n\nAlso, I think based on many people’s personal experience, they can attest that whenever they drink their morning coffee, frequent trips to the bathroom ensue. Thus, coffee must be dehydrating them **-or-** is it?\n\n### Caffeine as a Diuretic\n\nCaffeine can elicit extra water secretion by the kidneys or in other words acts as adiuretic, which by definition means “*Something that promotes the formation of urine by the kidney*.”\n\nHowever,a recent study 1 showed that only doses of 360 mg of caffeine or greater produced significantly more urine volume.\n\nAnother study 2 noted thatbuilt up caffeine tolerance also influences how well caffeine works as a diuretic. For **those without built up tolerance to caffeine the diuretic effect of caffeine was more prominent**.\n\nYetanother study 3 found that consuming caffeine prior to exercise negated the diuretic effect of caffeine as compared to consuming caffeine and then resting.\n\nIn contrary,this study 4 looked atenergy drink consumption and how caffeine and/or otherenergy drink ingredients like taurine influenced dehydration. They found that the testing group that received the caffeinated energy drinks had significantly more urine output than those that received no caffeine or just taurine only drinks. These subjects were already in a dehydrated state.\n\nTherefore, based on the research, caffeine is a diuretic but **not a very efficient one** since there are several factors that determine how well it actually works in this capacity.\n\n![dehydration](/resources/images/dehydration.jpg)\n\n## Does Caffeine Dehydrate?\n\n**So the question then remains, does caffeine dehydrate a person or not?**\n\nIf 400 mg of caffeine were consumed (as caffeine pills or energy shot) *without* drinking other fluids along with the dose, then there may be an overall dehydrating effect (as long as the person wasn’t overly tolerant to caffeine).\n\nYet most people consume caffeine in the form ofcoffee, tea, energy drinks, or soda, so what about in those cases?\n\nThe study mentioned above 4 looked at energy drink consumption and how caffeine and/or other energy drink ingredients like taurine influenced dehydration. They found that caffeine laced energy drinks did further dehydrate already dehydrated test subjects, but there was no adjusting for the subject’s tolerance to caffeine.\n\nAnotherresearch study 5 looked at all kinds of drinks like coffee, tea, soda, juice, water etc. and they concluded that there was “*no significant differences in the effect of various combinations of beverages on hydration status of healthy adult males. Advising people to disregard caffeinated beverages as part of the daily fluid intake is not substantiated by the results of this study*.”\n\nA more recent study (2014) 6 found that there was **no significant difference in hydration status between caffeine habituated males who consumed coffee in moderation with those that consumed just water**.\n\n![coffee and urination](/resources/images/stone-dog-194453_1280.jpg)\n\n**Then why does coffee make me have to pee?**\n\nThere are possibly a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, if you are already in a hydrated state any additional fluids will cause increased urine production. So, a 12-16 fl oz (355-500 ml) coffee will produce about the same amount of urine output.\n\nSecondly, if you aren’t a regular coffee or caffeine consumer then large amounts of caffeine does have a diuretic or dehydrating effect, thus increasing urine volume.\n\nLastly, caffeine can causeincontinence in some men and women. This causes the urge to urinate even if the bladder isn’t yet full. 7,8\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\nIf you are a regular consumer of caffeinated beverages then you needn’t worry about dehydration as long as you are consuming adequate fluid amounts in general.\n\nThis study 9 analyzed all valid studies on caffeine and dehydration prior to 2003.\n\n**Here’s what they concluded:**\n\n> *The most ecologically valid of the published studies offers no support for the suggestion that consumption of caffeine-containing beverages as part of a normal lifestyle leads to fluid loss in excess of the volume ingested or is associated with poor hydration status. Therefore, there would appear to be no clear basis for refraining from caffeine containing drinks in situations where fluid balance might be compromised.*\n\n**Therefore, coffee or tea and even soft drinks and energy drinks can be used as a way to hydrate the body and do not dehydrate.**\n\nHowever, consumers should keep in minddaily caffeine safety amounts,sugar consumption levels, and the health benefits of drinking plenty of plain water.', 0, '2021-03-11 17:22:18', '2021-03-11 17:22:20', '/resources/images/dehydration-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/caffeine-and-dehydration.html', 0, 0);

Your long-term good health could depend on it.', '![quitting coffee benefits](/resources/images/10218535933_4599e2a93f_o.jpg)\nBillions of people worldwide drink coffee or some form of caffeine every day.\n\n\n\nAlthough caffeine is generally accepted as safe for consumption in moderation, there are some solid benefits to breaking the habit and quitting coffee, energy drinks, tea, soda etc..\n\n### 1. Break the Addiction\n\nIn most peoplecaffeine is an addictive substance to some degree, although some would describe it as *highly addictive*.\n\nDepending on a substance to function normally or even stay awake, can become a vicious cycle. It changes our brain’s chemistry resulting in the need for more of the substance to achieve the desired results.\n\n*Quitting caffeine or coffee breaks the cycle and frees us from needing a daily drug to function normally.*\n\n### 2. Financial Savings\n\nThe cost of a caffeine addiction can add up and thousands of dollars a year could be saved if you quit.\n\n-A Grande Starbucks Latte: $3.65 a day | $26 a week | **$1,332 a year**\n-Monster Energy Drink: $3 a day | $21 a week | **$1,095 a year**\n-Home brewed coffee: $.71 a day | $5 per week | **$259 a year**\n-K-cups: $.65 a day | $4.55 a week | **$237 a year**\n-5 hour energy: $3 a day | $21 a week | **$1,095 a year**\n\n*Lendingtree.com has a helpful calculator that shows you exactly how much you’re spending on your beverage of choice.*\n\nAbove we have listed the average cost of just one beverage a day, now multiply that by the number you have each day and it quickly adds up.\n\n### 3. Lower Blood Pressure\n\nCaffeine can raise your blood pressure a few points and even more in some people.1\n\nQuitting coffee or caffeine can lower your blood pressure and keep your heart from working as hard.\n![ better sleep](/resources/images/caffeine-cleanse-sleep.jpg)\n\n### 4. Better Sleep\n\nCaffeine can greatly reduce the amount and quality of sleep.2 Drinking coffee or energy drinks too late in the day can interfere with getting to sleep since thehalf-life of caffeine is 4-6 hours.\n\nEven people who have no caffeine after 12 noon report a better quality of sleep after quitting caffeine.\n\n### 5. Better Mood\n\nCaffeine alters the mood. Many report being grumpy until they’ve had their morning coffee and others feel lethargic when the caffeine begins to wear off in the afternoon.\n\n*Quitting can even out the ups and downs.*\n\n### 6. Decreased Anxiety\n\nMany people report that caffeine increases their anxiety levels. This has to do with howcaffeine stimulates the adrenal glands.3\n\nQuitting coffee or caffeine can make you feel less anxious, especially if you are prone to anxiety issues.\n\n### 7. Fewer Headaches\n\nCaffeine is a major trigger for headaches. Any alteration in your normal daily caffeine consumption can result in a caffeine withdrawal headache.\n\nCaffeine can also be a migraine trigger.\n\n### 8. Convenience\n\n- Imagine never having to stop at Starbucks on the way to work?\n- Imagine never having to stop by the convenience store for a Red Bull?\n- Imagine erasing making coffee from your morning routine?\n- Imagine a backpacking trip without packing caffeine pills or the extra weight of coffee making equipment?\n\nBeing addicted to coffee, energy drinks, or soda creates inconvenience in our lives since we need the drug to function.\n\n![bathrooms](/resources/images/6242264195_cd717bc643_o.jpg)\n\n### 9. Fewer Trips to the Bathroom\n\nCaffeinated beverages cause us to urinate more often and in some people even cancause incontinence.\n\nCaffeine also stimulates the smooth muscles of the colon, which cause them to contract.\n\n*This can be challenging during meetings, road trips, or when bathrooms aren’t convenient.*\n\nQuitting can reduce the need to use the bathroom as often, especially in the mornings.\n\n### 10. Healthier Teeth\n\nCoffee and tea stain teeth and acidic & sweet energy drinks or sodas erode tooth enamel and can cause tooth decay.\n\nEliminating these beverages results in whiter and healthier teeth.\n\n### 11. Weight Loss\n\nUnless you drink your coffee black. Caffeinated beverages generally add empty calories to our diets that we don’t really need.\n\nMany experts say thatsugary beverages are a huge component of the obesity epidemic plaguing the western world.4\n\nA study from Victoria University found that when caffeine is in a sugary beverage it causes people to consumed more of that sugary beverage compared to a sugary beverage without caffeine.5\n\n- Quitting just a one Monster Energy Drink/day habit saves 200 calories per day, 1,400 calories a week, or **73,000 calories a year**!\n- Quitting just 1 Starbucks Vanilla Latte/day saves 250 calories per day, 1,750 calories a week, or **91,250 calories a year**!\n- Quitting a 16 fl.oz. Coke/day habit saves 239 calories a day, 1,673 calories a week, or **87,235 calories a year**!\n\n1 pound of fat contains the equivalent of 3500 calories, so do the math…\n\n### 12. Healthier Diet\n\nBottled coffees, teas, energy drinks, and sodas often containan assortment of preservatives designed to give them a longer shelf-life.\n\nThese preservatives can have adverse health effects andsome are even banned by other countries.\n\nSugar-free energy drinks and sodas contain artificial sweeteners that also can negatively affect your health.\n\nCutting these out of your diet can be beneficial to your overall long-term good health.\n\n![waste and litter](/resources/images/8874662530_cdd866802e_k.jpg)\n\n### 13. Cleaner Environment\n\nCaffeine addiction places a tremendous strain on our natural resources. Think of the number of plastic bottles, cans, and cups that have to be produced in order to meet the demand.\n\n> “*Americans discard about 33.6 million tons of plastic each year, but only 6.5 percent of it is recycled and 7.7 percent is combusted in waste-to-energy facilities, which create electricity or heat from garbage. The rest ends up in landfills where it may take up to 1,000 years to decompose.*.” –State of The Planet\n\nAlso,caffeine has been showing up in municipal water supplies because of all the discarded coffee grounds.\n\n*Quitting caffeine reduces your environmental footprint.*\n\n### 14. Caffeine Will Work Again\n\nConsuming caffeine daily quickly causes the human body to build up tolerance. The same dose of caffeine then causes a person to achieve a sense of normal rather than the euphoric feelings it once did.\n\nQuitting resets your body’s caffeine tolerance, allowing it to work really well on the occasions you really need it to.\n\n### 15. Possible Drug Interactions\n\nCaffeine can interact with other medications causing them to not work as they should.\n\n*Giving up caffeine eliminates this risk.*\n\n![heart-arrhythmia caffeine safety](/resources/images/heart-arrhythmia.jpg)\n\n### 16. No More Jitters\n\nOne of the leading side-effects of caffeine or coffee consumption is jitters or shaky hands. This can range from annoying to even debilitating for some people.\n\n*Quitting can give you your steady hands back.*\n\n### 17. Less Risk of Cardiac Events\n\nCaffeine stimulates the heart musclecausing it to beat with more forceful contractions.\n\nWhile this isn’t problematic for most people, those with underlying heart conditions can be at risk. People can be unaware that they even have a heart disorder until they begin to consume caffeine and the damage is done.\n\n### 18. Increased Productivity\n\n**What would you do with an extra hour every day?** Those addicted to caffeine can easily waste an hour standing in line at the coffee shop, making trips to the break room talking to coworkers along the way, and stopping at convenience stores.\n\n*The time saved could be used for an extra hour of sleep instead!*\n\n### 19. Reduced Type 2 Diabetes Risk\n\nWhile black coffee actually has beenshown to reduce diabetes risk, drinking sugary coffee and caffeinated beverages actually increase your risk of diabetes.\n\n> “*People who consume sugary drinks regularly—1 to 2 cans a day or more—have a 26% greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes*” –Harvard School of Public Health6\n\n### 20. Better Health\n\nMany research studies point to thehealth benefits of coffee and tea because of their antioxidant properties. However, this isn’t true for all caffeinated beverages.\n\nSoda, energy drinks, and processed coffee and tea products most likely have a negative impact on your long-term health.\n\nPeople who drink mainly water report more natural energy,better overall feelings of wellness, better sleep, and healthier skin.\n\n## Should You Quit?\n\nIf you are a slave to your coffee mug or energy drink, then you already know the answer. The real question becomes, how am I going to quit without failing my day-to-day responsibilities?\n\nIf that’s the case, then consider a product we endorse calledWean Caffeine to help you detox without withdrawal symptoms.\n\nWean Caffeine allows you to gradually cut down on caffeine systematically so that you can take back control of your natural energy levels while not losing control of your life.\n\n**Have you reaped any of the above benefits from giving up caffeine?**', 0, '2021-03-11 17:24:27', '2021-03-11 17:24:25', '/resources/images/10218535933_4599e2a93f_o-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/benefits-quitting-caffeine.html', 0, 0);

around 400mg of caffeine per person per day!\n- South American countries, such as Argentina and Brazil get most of their caffeine fromMaté.\n- The Brits are big tea drinkers (no surprises there).\n- The US? Just 168mg of caffeine per person per day (mostly coffee). I wonder how this has changed asenergy drinks have proliferated. Do coffee drinkers consume energy drinks as well?\n\nYou can read more about this research in Pharmacological Reviews, Vol. 51, Issue 1, 83-133, March 1999 “Actions of Caffeine in the Brain with Special Reference to Factors That Contribute to Its Widespread Use” link).', 0, '2021-03-11 17:24:29', '2021-03-11 17:24:30', '/resources/images/espresso-overdose-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/caffeine-what-the-world-drinks.html', 0, 0);

But coffee beans that have been ground up a few hours earlier.\n\nThe smell of coffee (or rather lack of it) is one a number of reasons forStarbucks faced decline a few years ago.\n\n**According to the CEO:**\n\n> *He noticed how the smell of the company’s breakfast sandwiches overpowered the aroma of coffee and new flavors had replaced genuine inspiration.*\n\n## The Coffee Aroma Research\n\nAs for that smell –new research has shown that just the SMELL of coffee is enough to wake up a bunch of sleep-deprived rats.\n\n> *We don’t know if the same genes are suppressed in sleep-deprived humans, nor whether we would feel tired if they were, but many of these genes do have human equivalents. So the team says gene suppression may help explain why people feel bad when they haven’t had enough sleep – and that gene reactivation could explain why people love the smell of coffee.*\n\nNext the team hopes to identify the molecules in coffee aroma that affect gene expression. They suggest pumping them into factories to help revive tired workers who can’t sip coffee while operating machinery.\n\n### Coffee Has a Very Complex Scent\n\nResearchers have so far identified 800 compounds in coffee and many of these are powerfully tied to scent.\n\n![coffee aroma](/resources/images/coffe-art.jpg)\n\nCoffee is rich inheterocyclic compounds, which influence the flavor and smell of a substance.\n\nHumans tend to love these smells since they hit many scent receptors. This helps people form powerful connections to items with these scents including coffee.\n\n### The Smell of Coffee Elicits Good Feelings\n\nSmells can trigger good feelings, memories, and even trauma, so it is no wonder that the smell of coffee triggers feelings of wakefulness.\n\nCoffee drinkers smell the coffee and this signals the brain that caffeine is indeed on the way, which provides stimulation.\n\nIn fact, I believe that the smell of coffee is actually much better than its taste. I drink mine black or with a little almond milk and bitterness is not one of the most appealing flavors to humans.\n\nIn any event, the smell of coffee and the drinking of it is something few would ever give up as the smell and taste are deeply tied to our brain’s pleasure center.\n\nThis one of the reasons responsible forour addiction to caffeine.\n\n**Do you think the best part of coffee is it aroma?**', 0, '2021-03-11 17:26:03', '2021-03-11 17:26:05', '/resources/images/aroma-of-coffee-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/just-smell-the-coffee.html', 0, 0);

Most research shows thatcoffee can be part of a diet that’s designed to prevent, treat, and/or possibly reverse type 2 diabetes.\n\n## Type 2 Diabetes and Coffee Research Studies\n\n1. A study published by the American Diabetes Association showed that those who drink coffee have lower sugar and insulin levels. It also appears that regular coffee is better than decaffeinated, so coffee could even prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes.15 overweight but otherwise healthy men were given either decaf coffee, a placebo, or the chemicals chlorogenic acid and trigonelline dissolved in water, which are two of the main antioxidants in coffee. The participants’ glucose and insulin levels were checked after consumption of each throughout the trial period. The only sample that showed lowered sugar and insulin levels was the chlorogenic acid and trigonelline solution group.Src.\n2. Another study analyzed much the latest research concerning diabetes and coffee consumption and was conducted by Harvard’s Dr. Frank Hu. His team found that the risk of type II diabetes decreased by 9% for each daily cup of coffee consumed. Decaf coffee decreased risk by 6% per cup.Src.\n3. An 11 year study looked at the diabetes and coffee risk association in postmenopausal women. They found that women who consumed 6 cups of coffee had a 22% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Src.\n4. An 18 year Swedish study also showed a greater degree of decreased risk among women who consume the most cups of coffee daily. *The Swedes are one of the highest coffee consumers in the world.*Src.\n5. “Nineteen of 22 epidemiological studies concluded that long-term consumption of coffee, both caffeinated and decaffeinated, can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, but several investigators have warned that the caffeine in caffeinated coffee can impair glucose metabolism” fromDiabetes Journals.\n6. The newer study is from the Harvard School of Public Health and it showed that type 2 diabetes risk decreases with every cup of coffee consumed. People who increased their coffee consumption by one cup saw an 11% decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, those that decreased their coffee consumption by one cup saw a 17% increase in risk.Src.\n7. Yet another study out of Denmark showed that coffee consumption doesn’t increase type 2 diabetes risk nor obesity risk for even the staunchest of coffee drinkers. 93,000 people’s coffee habits were analyzed for the study and there was no association between coffee consumption obesity, and diabetes.The study.\n\n### Decaf Coffee Not as Helpful\n\nAlthough, caffeinated coffee does seem to offer the most protection, it isn’t likely due to the caffeine. Coffee is actuallyrich in antioxidants.\n\n![coffee-and-diabetes](/resources/images/coffee-and-diabetes.jpg)\n\nIn the decaffeination process these antioxidants are also removed to much lower concentrations along with the caffeine.\n\nThis explains why the same results weren’t observed with thedecaf samples. Therefore, it does seem to be best to have regular, full-test coffee that’s been un-messed around with if you want to experience less type 2 diabetes risk or help in treating this form of diabetes.\n\n## Caffeine Lowers Blood Glucose Levels During Exercise\n\nResearchers found that when people with type 2 diabetes use caffeine prior to exercise it lowers their blood glucose levels more.\n\nStudy participants given 1 mg of caffeine per 1 kg of body weight had on average a 75 mg/dL increased drop in blood sugar compared with those who did not have the caffeine.\n\n**Good or Bad?**\n\nGood if you are trying to naturally lower your blood sugar with diet and exercise.\n\nBad if you are on insulin and in danger of your blood sugar dropping too low.\n\n### The Bottom Line?\n\nThis is good news for coffee drinkers or those that would be at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. You can drink all the coffee you want, but we would advise that you learn to drink it black to experience the full benefits. Also be sure to not go beyond establisheddaily caffeine safe levels.\n\nAdding sugar and creamer no doubt quickly reduces some of coffee’s type 2 diabetes protective benefits.\n\n*If you have diabetes always consult your physician before making any changes to your diet.*', 0, '2021-03-11 17:27:57', '2021-03-11 17:27:58', '/resources/images/coffee-caffeine-diabetes-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/coffee-and-diabetes.html', 0, 0);

At only a few state testing sites, including some of Maryland\'s drive-through testing sites, a provider\'s order is not required, and patients do not have to have symptoms.\n\nTo get a coronavirus test at other facilities, including all University of Maryland Medical System facilities, a doctor\'s order is required. Find an UMMS coronavirus testing location.\n\nCall your doctor BEFORE going to the doctor\'s office, ER or urgent care center, to let them know your symptoms.\n\n### What to Do If:\n\n**You don\'t have a primary care doctor. **You can contact your city or county health department for advice, or call the UMMS Nurse Call Line, a free 24/7 phone service to answer questions from the community about coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\n\n**You have mild symptoms.** Coronavirus can be treated at home.

Don\'t waste time trying to get a test. Call 911 or go to the nearest hospital ER or urgent care center.\n\n## Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Testing\n\nIt is possible to transmit coronavirus even if you are not symptomatic, so everyone should take precautions to avoid spreading the virus. However, it is most contagious when people have symptoms.\n\n\"Symptomatic persons have more virus in their respiratory tract than those who are not symptomatic. Also, their coughing and sneezing releases droplets in the air around them, on surfaces and on their hands, which makes them more contagious than someone with no symptoms,\" says Gregory M. Schrank, MD, an infectious disease specialist who is co-chair of the COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Committee for the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) and the University of Maryland, Baltimore..\n\nIn the early stages of infection, before symptoms appear, it is possible the virus will not be detected by a test, according to the CDC, so a negative test might provide a false sense of security.\n\n### If You Are Well, but Worried\n\nIf you don\'t have symptoms, but are worried about getting sick, the best advice is to follow guidelines for social distancing], wash your hands often for a full 20 seconds with soap and water, use hand sanitizer when soap and water are not available, and avoid touching your face. Those precautions will help you avoid getting sick more than a test would, says Dr. Schrank.\n\n\"Also remember that about 80 percent of cases are mild and people will recover on their own,\" he says.\n\nPeople who are at higher risk – those age 70 or older, or with diabetes, heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – should monitor their health closely and contact their primary care practitioners with any concerns, Dr. Schrank says.\n\n## Drive-Up Coronavirus Testing\n\nDrive-up sites continue to be a good model for testing those with a doctor\'s order, Dr. Shrank says. It limits the risk of transmission to and from other patients (compared to being inside a crowded medical office and emergency room) and keeps health care providers safer while still allowing them to swab the patient\'s nose or throat for a sample, take vital signs and observe patients for potential signs of serious illness.\n\n\"It\'s very understandable to have anxiety and stress about coronavirus,\" Dr. Schrank says. \"But if you\'re worried at all, remember the best way to prevent infection of any kind is with frequent hand-washing, use of hand sanitizer and social distancing.\"', 0, '2021-03-16 17:47:16', '2021-03-16 17:47:18', '/resources/images/virus550.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/diagnosis-symptoms/test', 0, 0);

The CDC recommends using a cloth mask that can be created from cheap materials or household items, such as a T-shirt.\n\nGoing forward, the most important way you can protect yourself from the virus, as well as others, is to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you. However, it is important to continue wearing a mask and practicing social distancing, even after you have been vaccinated.\n\nMedical-grade masks, such as surgical or N-95 masks, need to be reserved for those who need them most and should only be worn by healthcare workers or first responders. Learn more about the type of mask that is right for you.\n\nWearing a homemade mask is particularly important in places where maintaining a distance of 6 feet or more from other people is difficult, such as the grocery store or pharmacies.\n\nIt is also one of the many reasons why the University of Maryland Medical System\'s visitor restrictions require every person entering a hospital or physician practice to wear a face mask at all times.\n\n## What Face Covers Do\n\nNovel coronavirus infects others through droplets. These droplets can be projected into the air when someone speaks, coughs or sneezes. Risk of coronavirus transmission through these droplets is higher when people are in close proximity to one another.\n\nCloth masks contain those droplets and keep them from projecting into the air, reducing the likelihood of transmission. This is particularly important when normal social distancing measures are difficult to follow, such as getting groceries or medications at a pharmacy.\n\nMasks mainly keep you from unknowingly spreading the disease to others, but some studies indicate that they may help protect you from large droplets and serve as an indirect reminder to avoid touching your face.\n\nHomemade masks are not a replacement for social distancing measures. You should still do everything you can to prevent coronavirus infection, including avoiding close contact with other people and washing your hands frequently.\n\n## Why Wear a Cloth Mask?\n\nFace masks are necessary to protect others from novel coronavirus.\n\nSome people who have coronavirus are asymptomatic, meaning they have no symptoms. Some with the virus have no symptoms but will go on to develop coronavirus symptoms; they are considered pre-symptomatic. Studies have shown that asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people are potentially contagious and can unknowingly infect others\n\nIn light of this information, the CDC has recommended wearing a face mask to reduce transmission and keep people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic from infecting others.\n\n## Who Should Wear a Homemade Mask?\n\nWearing a homemade mask is voluntary, but the CDC recommends that most people should wear them. There are some exceptions to this recommendation.\n\nThe following people should not wear them:\n\n- Children under two years old\n- People with breathing problems\n- People who can\'t remove the mask without assistance, such as those who are incapacitated or disabled\n\n## Coronavirus Mask Usage and Care\n\nEffective coronavirus masks will fit snugly against the face when worn. When removing them, it is important to avoid touching your face – especially your eyes, nose and mouth. Wash your hands immediately after removing the mask.\n\nMasks should be cleaned after every wear. This frequency will vary depending on how often you need to wear the mask. The CDC recommends using a machine washer and dryer for proper cleaning. Read more about cleaning for coronavirus.\n\n## Make Your Own Mask\n\nThere are many ways to make a cloth mask at home. Not all of these methods require a sewing machine.\n\nHomemade masks must meet these basic requirements:\n\n- Fit snugly but comfortably against the sides of the face\n- Be secured with ties or ear loops\n- Have multiple layers of fabric\n- Allow for unrestricted breathing\n- Able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or shape changes\n\nTo see approved ways to make a face cover, visit the CDC website.', 0, '2021-03-16 17:51:19', '2021-03-16 17:51:21', '/resources/images/coronavirus-tips-facemask.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/masks', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (103, 7, 'How Coronavirus Spreads', '', '![Illustration of coronavirus on a molecular level](/resources/images/coronavirus-spread.jpg)\n\nUnderstanding how coronavirus spreads is an important part of protecting yourself. Coronavirus transmission can happen in a variety of ways.\n\nLearn more about how COVID spreads and what you can do to protect yourself. Going forward, though, the most important way you can protect yourself from the virus as well as others is to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you.\n\n## How Does the Coronavirus Spread?\n\nThough novel coronavirus is still very new, we are learning more about the different ways it can spread. There are three primary modes of transmission.\n\n### Respiratory Droplets\n\nRespiratory droplets that contain the virus are the primary vehicle for coronavirus spread, according to the CDC.\n\nRespiratory droplets are created by infectious people when they cough, sneeze, sing, shout, talk or even just breathe. If a nearby person inhales these droplets, they can become infected.\n\nIf these droplets land on nearby surfaces, they can also become contaminated.\n\n#### Avoiding Respiratory Transmission\n\n- Social distancing and avoiding people you don\'t live with as much as possible is the best way to prevent coronavirus spread.\n- Remaining at least 6 feet apart from others can also significantly reduce your chances of inhaling respiratory droplets.\n- Wearing a mask can also help contain the respiratory droplets you exhale as well as creating a barrier between you and an infected person\'s respiratory droplets.\n\n### Contact Transmission\n\nAnother main way coronavirus spreads is by directly touching a person who is infected. You can also get coronavirus by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your mouth, nose or another membrane, which would allow it to enter the body.\n\n#### Avoiding Contact Transmission\n\nBe sure to:\n\n- Diligently wash your hands\n- Properly clean high-touch surfaces\n- Avoid touching your face\n\n### Airborne Virus Transmission\n\nIn October, the CDC officially recognized that coronavirus could spread through airborne transmission. Airborne transmission is when respiratory droplets containing the virus remain suspended in the air for a longer amount of time (hours rather than minutes or seconds). Droplets that remain airborne can also travel over distances greater than 6 feet.\n\n#### Avoiding Airborne Transmission\n\nThere are certain situations that you should avoid to decrease your risk of being infected through airborne transmission:\n\n- **Crowded spaces.** Spaces with lots of people and poor ventilation can put you at risk.\n- **Inadequate ventilation. **Being in closed-off spaces with little ventilation or air movement allows suspended respiratory droplets to build up in the air. If an infectious person is or has recently been in the space, airborne transmission could occur.\n- **Taking part in activities that generate excessive respiratory droplets. **In addition to the above, certain actions produce more and smaller respiratory droplets than others, increasing the likelihood of airborne transmission in enclosed spaces. These activities include shouting, singing and exercising.\n\n## Is the Coronavirus Airborne?\n\nThough we have long known about the coronavirus\'s ability to spread through respiratory droplets, many have also wondered if the coronavirus is airborne.\n\nAfter analyzing the evidence currently available, the CDC determined that it\'s possible for the coronavirus to spread through the air. The difference between airborne and droplet transmission may seem like a technicality, but there are distinct ramifications.\n\nRespiratory droplets aren\'t all the same. They can be large, even visible to the naked eye. This means that they fall to the ground quickly and are less likely to be inhaled by another person.\n\nIn airborne transmission, these droplets are very small, meaning that they are lighter and can remain in the air for extended periods of time. Small droplets can also travel greater distances, moving with air currents. This means that, in certain cases, 6 feet of distance may not be enough to protect yourself.\n\nIn a health care setting, taking measures to stop transmission is essential for keeping patients safe. All University of Maryland Medical System hospitals have been isolating patients with or suspected of having coronavirus since the beginning of the pandemic. This practice, which began as a precautionary measure as we learned more about the virus, has since become an important part of keeping our patients safe when they need to go to the hospital.\n\n## Does Weather Affect Coronavirus Spread?\n\nWhile the virus is new and studies are still being conducted, as of November 2020, the relationship between weather and coronavirus spread still isn\'t fully understood. What we do know is that coronavirus spread can still happen in any kind of weather.\n\n**If so, why is there concern about the virus becoming worse in the winter?**\n\nOther respiratory viruses, like the common cold or flu, spread more in the winter months. Some believe that viruses can live longer in colder temperatures and lower humidity, but this is still a topic of study and is not currently considered the main contributor to respiratory virus seasonality.\n\nInstead, the main factor seems to be human behavior. When the weather gets cold, we retreat indoors — often with other people in poorly ventilated spaces. This allows highly infectious viruses to spread from person-to-person with ease.\n\nThis means that items like humidifiers, while useful for relieving respiratory illness symptoms, will likely have no significant impact on the potential for coronavirus spread this winter. The best way to protect yourself is by using CDC-recommended coronavirus prevention measures.', 0, '2021-03-16 17:52:41', '2021-03-16 17:52:39', '/resources/images/coronavirus-spread.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/prevention-safety/coronavirus-spread', 0, 0);

For instance, it can last up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to a few days on plastics and stainless steel.\n\n## How to Disinfect For Coronavirus\n\nLearn what kinds of cleaning you need to do right now to help you and your family stay well.\n\n### Cleaning Surfaces in Your Home\n\nYou want to go beyond a light cleaning. You should use household cleaning products to disinfect high-touch areas in your home, like:\n\n- Countertops\n- Rails\n- Tables\n- Backs of chairs\n- Light switches\n- Faucets\n- Toilets\n- Refrigerator doors\n- Doorknobs\n- Remote controls\n\nIf it is touched throughout the day, clean it! Once a day may not be enough because no one is sure yet how long these germs can live on specific surfaces. You should sanitize these areas several times each day.\n\nAlso, a quick swipe of a damp paper towel is not enough to kill the germs. Tables and countertops, for example, need to be visibly wet for several minutes. Check the side of the cleaner as it usually states a suggested time that the surface needs to be wet to make the maximum impact.\n\n### Cleaning Your Phone\n\nCoronavirus germs can live on our phones, which is why we need to be cleaning them now more than ever.\n\nFor anyone with an iPhone, Apple recommends using a 70 percent isopropyl alcohol wipe or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes to gently wipe the exterior surfaces of your iPhone. Do not use bleach. Samsung has not commented on whether wipes are a good way to clean your phone.\n\nAnd don\'t forget the phone case. This can also be cleaned with a disinfecting wipe.\n\n### Cleaning Computers\n\nComputers and other electronic devices are a high-touch surfaces. They should be cleaned often, particularly if multiple people use the same one.\n\nUse a solution of 70 percent isopropyl alcohol and 30 water, as recommended by the CDC. Many household cleaners and disinfectants have bleach, peroxides, acetone or ammonia, which may cause permanent damage to the product.\n\nTurn off the device before cleaning and clean all surfaces that hands may touch.\n\n### Sanitizing Laundry\n\nIf you are caring for someone with coronavirus or you are going out the grocery store or other public places, you may need to take extra care with your laundry.\n\n- Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool or body fluids on them.\n- Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body.\n- Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after removing your gloves.\n- Read and follow directions on labels of laundry or clothing items and detergent.

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (106, 7, 'How Not to Touch Your Face', '', '![Man rubbing his eyes and holding glasses](/resources/images/touch-face.jpg)\n\nTo reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), experts recommend that you not touch your face because the virus is transmitted through mucous membranes in the mouth, nose and eyes.\n\nThis is in addition to other virus prevention steps such as washing your hands frequently, practicing social distancing and using a homemade face mask.\n\nYet, these three recommendations are much easier to do than to keep your hand away from your face.\n\n## Why You Touch Your Face\n\nTouching your face is a habit that most of us have. We brush the hair from our eyes, scratch our noses, rest our chins in our hands multiple times throughout the day, not to mention taking glasses on and off, rubbing our foreheads and most recently, putting on and taking off our face masks.\n\nPay attention to how many times you touch your face in just an hour. According to a recent research study, participants touched their faces an average of 23 times per hour. Of those touches, 44 percent came in contact with mucous membranes.\n\n## How the Virus Is Transmitted\n\nExperts believe that the coronavirus is most commonly spread by droplets that are sneezed or coughed out and are then inhaled by someone else.\n\nThose droplets can land on surfaces, and when you touch that surface and then touch your mouth, nose or eyes, the virus can enter your body.\n\nThat is part of the reason it is so important to wash your hands. But in between washes, you are still at risk for getting the virus.\n\n## How to Stop Touching Your Face\n\nFortunately, the same study also found that by making the participants aware of how often they touched their faces and teaching them how it has the potential to spread illness, they were less likely to touch their faces.\n\nWe also came up with some ways that may help you touch your face less often:\n\n- ### Be aware.\n\n\n- Pay attention to how often you touch your face. This can include watching other people. Noticing how often they do it can bring awareness to you.\n\n\n- ### Change the way you sit.\n\n\n- Avoid putting your elbows on the tabletop because this often leads to resting your chin in your hands. You can even try sitting on your hands or folding them in your lap to keep them away from your face.\n\n\n- ### Keep your hands busy.\n\n\n- Try using a fidget spinner, knitting or crochet, rubber band or stress ball to keep your hands occupied.\n\n\n- ### Tie or pin back hair.\n\n\n- If your hair is causing you to touch your face, fix it in a new way so you don’t have to keep pushing it out of your eyes.\n\n\n- ### Make sure your glasses fit properly.\n\n\n- They should not slide down your face. If you need to push them up or take them off, handle them from sides, not the bridge or other parts that touch your face.\n\n\n- ### Use a tissue.\n\n\n- If you have an itch or have to touch your face for any reason, hold a clean tissue in your hand as you do it.\n\n\n- ### Prevent itchiness.\n\n\n- Use moisturizer to prevent dry, itchy skin. Use eye drops if your eyes are dry and itchy. (Make sure to wash your hands before and after using the eye drops.) Treat seasonal allergies to prevent itchy noses.\n\n\n- ### Wear a scent.\n\n\n- Apply a light perfume or lotion on your hands or wrists that you can smell every time you bring your hands to your face.\n\n\n- ### Imagine your hands are dirty.\n\n\n- You can\'t see the germs on your hand, so pretend that your hands are covered in something visible, like paint or mud. This is more useful in short-term situations like when shopping at the grocery store.\n\n\n- ### Wear a mask.\n\n\n- A face mask can act as a reminder** **to not touch your face. However, it\'s important to note that, if wearing a mask makes you fidget or you find yourself constantly adjusting it, this is not a good technique for you. You are still required to wear a face mask when going into certain public places, such as retail establishments and riding on public transportation.\n\nEven if you are excellent at not touching your face, you still need to wash your hands or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer frequently, especially if you go out in public. Since touching your face is a habit, there will still be times you fall back into old ways. Do your best, but keep washing those hands!', 0, '2021-03-16 17:58:08', '2021-03-16 17:58:10', '/resources/images/touch-face.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/prevention-safety/protect/not-touch-face', 0, 0);

To determine if the cause could be the coronavirus, you should also ask yourself the following questions:\n\n**Did you have close contact with a diagnosed COVID-19 patient? **Close contact means that you spent time within 6 feet of the person (see how the CDC defines close contact) or have come into direct contact with their saliva through coughing or sneezing.\n\n**Have you visited an area that has high community transmission of COVID 19? **If you have traveled, consider if you visited a city, state or country with COVID-19 spread.\n\n**Are you at a higher risk for coronavirus?** Based on the evidence we have so far, older adults and people with chronic diseases are most susceptible to serious complications from the virus.\n\n## Next Steps If You Have Coronavirus Symptoms\n\nIf you have developed these symptoms, here are a few next steps you can take based on your symptoms and health history.\n\n### If you are experiencing mild symptoms:\n\n- Do not leave your home. Do not go to the hospital or call 911 unless it is an emergency. Learn more about when to go to the hospital.\n- Call your healthcare provider for more information.

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (109, 7, 'Coronavirus Immunity', '', '![Watercolor illustration of virus and globe](/resources/images/coronavirus-immunity.jpg)\n\nMany people hope that coronavirus immunity can bring them back to \"normal life\" and that those who recovered from coronavirus do not need to be concerned about being infected or infecting others.\n\nUnfortunately, there are too many unknowns about immunity to novel coronavirus to be sure.\n\nLearn what we currently know about coronavirus immunity, why we haven\'t relied on coronavirus herd immunity to end the pandemic and what antibody testing can tell you.\n\n------\n\n**COVID Vaccine: **The most important way you can protect yourself from the virus as well as others is to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you.\n\n------\n\n## Can You Get Coronavirus Twice?\n\nThere is currently no conclusive evidence that points to how long coronavirus immunity lasts. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there here have been a few recorded cases of coronavirus reinfection, but they remain rare.\n\nScientists are still studying the duration of coronavirus immunity and how likely a person is to get COVID-19 twice. Because of these unknowns, the CDC recommends always adhering to coronavirus prevention measures, even if you\'ve been infected before.\n\n## How Viruses Work\n\nTo understand coronavirus immunity, it is important to know how viruses work and how the immune system responds to them.\n\nViruses are pieces of genetic material surrounded by a protein coating. They can\'t reproduce without finding \"host cells.\" This is why they seek out cells like the ones in our bodies.\n\nWhen viruses enter our bodies, they find a cell and inject it with their genetic material. This allows them to take control of the cell and multiply.\n\nTo battle this, the body\'s immune system must destroy infected cells. When the body first encounters a new viral infection, it deploys T cells, which find and kill infected cells. If the infection continues, the body then deploys B cells, which create antibodies that can better attack infected cells.\n\nEven after the infection has passed, antibodies remain in the body to help the body fight off future infection. How long these antibodies last in the body varies, ranging from days to a lifetime.\n\n## Understanding COVID Immunity\n\nThere are still many unknowns when it comes to coronavirus immunity. At this time, there is currently no way to know how long any immunity could last.\n\nOther types of coronaviruses, such as MERS, do induce immunity, often for several years. Many hope that SARS-CoV-2 will behave similarly.\n\nUnfortunately, the data is not cut-and-dry. Most studies of immunity to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, focus on people who had severe disease and were hospitalized for their condition. There is significantly less data on the immune response in people who had mild symptoms or were asymptomatic.\n\nAll of these unknowns are why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization currently state that there is no evidence to suggest novel coronavirus infection imparts immunity. More research needs to done.\n\n## Coronavirus Herd Immunity\n\nThere are multiple reasons why we can\'t lean on herd immunity to help slow the spread of coronavirus.\n\nHerd immunity is when most of a population is immune to an infectious disease, thus providing indirect protection to people who aren\'t immune to the disease.\n\nVaccines are the best tactic for creating herd immunity. Even if the majority of the population has had an infectious disease, if there is no vaccine, the disease can still be transmitted among children who haven\'t yet been exposed to the virus and people who are immunocompromised.\n\nAt this point in time, there are several reasons why herd immunity cannot help stem the pandemic in the United States. Instead, we must rely on other prevention measures.\n\nAccording to a report by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, current data suggests that around 70 percent of the population would need to be immune to achieve herd immunity to coronavirus.\n\nEvidence suggests that infection rates are much lower. Reaching the levels of infection needed to achieve herd immunity without a vaccine could be devastating, potentially overwhelming health care systems and leading to an extraordinary number of deaths.\n\n## Coronavirus Antibody Tests\n\nCoronavirus antibody tests identify specific antibodies in a person\'s blood that indicate they have been infected with the virus. Antibody tests are different than the tests used to detect an active coronavirus infection.\n\nAntibody Tests and Coronavirus Immunity\n\nAntibody tests do not tell you whether you are immune to coronavirus. They simply indicate if you have or haven\'t been infected with the virus. If you have been infected, it doesn\'t necessarily mean you are immune.\n\nA positive antibody test isn\'t an \"immunity passport.\" It does not mean that you can stop practicing the prevention measures that keep you and others safe, such as:\n\n- Social distancing\n- Washing your hands\n- Avoiding touching your face\n- Wearing a mask\n\n### What a Coronavirus Antibody Test Can Tell You\n\nIf coronavirus antibody tests can\'t tell you if you\'re immune to the virus, then what can they do?\n\nAntibody tests give you a better understanding of how you have personally been affected by the virus. It can also put you in a position to participate in plasma donation to help treat others.\n\nAntibody tests are also being used to help determine how widespread coronavirus infection is in certain communities. This can be beneficial for creating public policy and better understanding how to keep communities safe.', 0, '2021-03-16 18:04:09', '2021-03-16 18:04:11', '/resources/images/coronavirus-immunity.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/covid-vaccine/facts/immunity', 0, 0);

It looks like a magical dust that transforms into an even coat of paint. But it\'s completely different from nail polish. A regular manicure can chip immediately after you leave the salon, but most dip-powder manicures claim to last up to three weeks longer than gel manicures. So when my nail tech asked if I wanted to try it out, I was down. But I found out that it isn\'t a new technique at all, dip powder has actually been around since the ‘80s.\r\n\r\nThe name dip powder basically explains the process. First, a base coat is applied, and the nail is dipped into a powder. The process is repeated a couple of times depending on how many coats you want. Then, the rough, powdery layers are transformed into a smooth, glossy finish once a sealant is applied. The best part: You don\'t have to worry about the possibility of skin damage from UV lamps. Unlike the classic gel manicure, it dries instantly. And the powders don\'t pose any inhalation threats, according to chemist Doug Schoon, president of Schoon Scientific + Regulatory Consulting and co-chair of Nail Manufacturer’s Council. That\'s why it\'s being marketed with words like \"safe,\" \"natural,\" and \"organic.\" However those claims aren\'t regulated, and choosing the powders over gel manis isn\'t necessarily a better choice.\r\n\r\nRelated: If You Get Gel Manicures, This Is What You Need To Know About UV Lamps And Skin Cancer\r\n\r\nIn fact, gel manicures, dip powders, and traditional nail extensions have more in common than you think. They are all made up of an acrylic base. \"All of the ingredients used to make any type of artificial nail—whether they be glued, cured by UV, or mixed with a liquid and powder—are based on the acrylic family,\" Schoon says.\r\n\r\nSo, how do dip powders differ from acrylic nails and gel manicures? The grains are finer, which allows them to be created in more vibrant colors. Dip powders are bonded using a glue called cyanoacrylate, which is also the main ingredient in Krazy Glue. \"Acrylic nails\", on the other hand, are applied by combining a liquid with a powder to form a gel. Similarly, the ingredients in gel manicures are like pre-mixed acrylics, and they undergo a chemical reaction once they are cured with a UV lamp.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRelated: What Your Nails Can Tell You About Your Health\r\n\r\nSo, in theory they are all the same. But that doesn\'t mean that they are all bad for your nails. Schoon says that you could wear acrylics for years without harming your nails. You\'ll only see problems if the application, maintenance, or removal techniques are done incorrectly. That\'s why it\'s important to find a salon that doesn\'t rush during the removal process. The dip-powder manicures soak off just like gel manis but can take longer. \"One thing that people don’t understand is that if it says soak for fifteen minutes to remove, that’s the minimum time,\" Schoon says. And the longer you leave the acrylics on, the longer it will take to soak them off. \"It may be fifteen minutes if you take them off the same day, but if you wait two weeks or four weeks, it could take thirty minutes.\" The last thing you want to do is scrape off layers of your nails, so it\'s worth it to be patient. And there is no such thing as gently scraping. \"That\'s like saying I punched you gently in the nose,\" Schoon says.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to reserve dip powder and other acrylic-based manicures for special occasions. \"This may be great as a one time use when you want stronger nails,\" says celebrity nail stylist Elle. The acrylics will create a hard surface on your nails while you\'re wearing them. So, find a technician that won\'t rush through any steps, and one that can talk to you about how to properly take care of your nails in between appointments.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:12:14', '2021-05-28 19:12:17', '/resources/images/wps6.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/dip-powder-nail-polish-manicures', 0, 0);

But, she recently revealed, those manis come at a price. Rushmore-Perrin told the Daily Mail that she’s been getting acrylics for six years. She says she has them done professionally and usually has them removed by professionals, but she recently didn’t have time to visit the salon and decided to DIY. “One nail had come off, and I didn’t want to have nine nails on, so I started peeling and snapping them off,” she said. “I then soaked the remains off in acetone.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that didn’t end well. Rushmore-Perrin posted a photo on Twitter of her torn, cracked, and bleeding nails after she removed her acrylic manicure herself. In another tweet, she said the pain was excruciating. “Nearly cried in the shower at the hot water touching my nail beds and I\'m pretty sure there\'s still loads of shampoo left in my hair,\" she replied to the tweet. “Don’t even care how they look, it’s the physical PAIN dear lord.”\r\n\r\nRushmore-Perrin posted another photo of her much healthier-looking nails less than a week afterward. “Five days later, after taking two different kinds of biotin every day,” she captioned the photo. “Still not amazing or beautiful, but LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, biotin is necessary for the formation of fatty acids and glucose, which fuel the body. Biotin is also a B vitamin that helps provide the necessary building blocks for healthy hair and nail production, Joshua Zeichner, M.D., a New York City-based board-certified dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Rushmore-Perrin\'s case, doctors doubt biotin helped repair her nails. Your nails are only really alive at the base, Doris Day, M.D., a clinical associate professor of dermatology at the New York University Langone Medical Center, tells SELF. By the time nails grow beyond the cuticle, they’re just dead cells, similar to your hair. Therefore, any potential benefits from biotin supplements will be seen from the base on up, which is why Gary Goldenberg, M.D., medical director of the Dermatology Faculty Practice at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells SELF that although biotin is helpful in the development and growth of nails, it can take six to 12 months for people to see results. Day is skeptical Rushmore-Perrin\'s progress is due to the biotin, adding that the beauty blogger\'s nails likely got better because she stopped putting acrylics on and they had time to heal.\r\n\r\nAngelica Ross Gets a Buzz Cut, Talks Womanhood & Radical Blackness\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt\'s usually not necessary to take biotin for hair and nail benefits because it\'s rare for people to be deficient in biotin, Day says. That means people’s bodies typically make healthy hair and nails just fine without additional supplementation. If you do use a supplement, Zeichner says you won’t see any changes to hair and nails you already have. What you can expect, if your body is deficient in biotin, is new hair and nail growth that\'s potentially stronger and healthier than you\'re used to. Jill Waibel, M.D., founder and owner of The Miami Dermatology and Laser in Institute, tells SELF that biotin has been found to be especially helpful with brittle nails, which makes sense since that\'s a common sign of biotin deficiency.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to keep in mind: Supplements are unregulated and can definitely be dangerous or cause unpleasant side effects (many biotin-supplementing people complain of cystic acne online) if you take too many of them. Instead of popping a supplement, Goldenberg points out that it\'s better to get the vitamin from foods such as avocados, fish, and legumes.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re still intrigued, check in with your doctor or dermatologist—they\'ll be able to determine whether you have some sort of deficiency affecting your nails or hair, then be able to figure out an action plan from there.\r\n', 0, '2021-05-28 19:15:20', '2021-05-28 19:15:17', '/resources/images/wps7.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/biotin-nails-acrylics-repair', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (117, 14, 'What Is Dermaplaning and Should You Try It?', 'Here\'s what experts say you should know.', '![img](/resources/images/wps1-1622200668692.png) \r\n\r\nYou may have seen people on YouTube shaving their faces using small razors to exfoliate their skin or get rid of facial hair and wondered, “What is dermaplaning, and should I try it?”\r\n\r\nWhile those YouTube tutorials may make dermaplaning look like an easy “do it yourself” procedure, experts say you should avoid trying this at home for several reasons that we will explain. Plus, dermaplaning is not recommended for all skin types, so it’s best to consult with a dermatologist about whether it’s right for you. Below, dermatologists explain what you should know about dermaplaning, including the risks, benefits, and cost.\r\n\r\n***\\*What is dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nDermaplaning is a cosmetic procedure that involves scraping your face with a scalpel to remove the e pidermis—your top layer of skin—and small hairs, explains Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D., professor of dermatology, medicine, and nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Traditionally, people have the procedure done in a dermatologist’s office, however, you can find blades at the drugstore marketed for at-home dermaplaning use. That said, it’s safer for a professional to perform this. (We’ll get to all of that in a bit.) It’s also always a good idea to research any procedure you’re interested in, even if you delay the actual procedure itself because of the pandemic. (Here’s more information to help you navigate making medical appointments during COVID-19). \r\n\r\nDuring a dermaplaning session, the dermatologist uses a medical-grade scalpel to scrape across the surface of the skin. The treatment takes about 15 minutes, and it can cost anywhere from $40 to more than $150, depending on where you go.\r\n\r\n***\\*What are the benefits of dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nThe main reason people do it is to remove the vellus hairs on their faces, which some people refer to as peach fuzz. Everyone has these fine vellus hairs coating their bodies, and they serve a purpose: Vellus hairs keep us warm and add another layer of protection to the skin. But some people’s vellus hairs are thicker and more visible than others, and depending on how they feel about that, they might want to have it removed. Of course, dermaplaning is just one way to do that. There are many at-home hair removal kits that may get the job done, including the Glee Face Wax Hair Removal Strips for Women ($9, Walmart.com) that a SELF editor loves. However, dermatologist Rosemarie Ingleton, M.D., tells SELF that typical hair-removal methods like waxing and threading don’t always provide the results people are looking for, which makes dermaplaning an appealing option. You may have heard that shaving hair on your face makes hair grow back thicker—that’s technically not true. But it may look thicker or darker, thanks to having a blunter tip from shaving as it grows out, according to the Mayo Clinic.\r\n\r\nPeople might try laser hair removal for longer-lasting results, according to Jeanine Downie, M.D., a dermatologist in New Jersey. This method damages the hair follicles using heat, so your strands don’t grow back as easily. Although it is marketed as a permanent option, your hair may grow back after any hormonal changes (like menopause), according to the Cleveland Clinic. It also takes several sessions to see changes. The exact amount varies, and generally, people with dark skin need more sessions compared to people with light skin. This option also doesn’t work on gray hairs.\r\n\r\nDr. Ingleton says that the biggest reason she does dermaplaning in her practice is to remove vellus hairs, but that the blade also gets rid of a superficial layer of dead skin. This can make your skin look brighter, help your skin-care products sink in better, and make your foundation go on smoother. In Dr. Ingleton’s practice, dermaplaning is often an add-on done before other treatments like microdermabrasion or ablative lasers like Fraxel. When it comes to exfoliating, there are no studies showing how dermaplaning compares to other treatments like retinoids or chemical peels, says Dr. Kim. That’s one reason why Dr. Downie prefers to use peels over dermaplaning—even for sensitive skin—and doesn’t offer dermaplaning in her practice. “Peels help to improve texture, tone, acne, and fine lines,” she says. “They are not equivalent at all, and many peels give deeper exfoliation than a scalpel,” Dr. Downie says.\r\n\r\nIs it ok to try dermaplaning at home?\r\n\r\nWhile it might feel like getting rid of these hairs is easy to do at home with an inexpensive blade, professionals warn against it. Any blade you get over-the-counter won’t be as sharp—or as effective—as the medical-grade scalpel used at the office. Also, there’s always the chance you will cut yourself in the process, potentially causing scarring.\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nAnytime a sharp object goes near your face, there is a risk of damage to the skin. Dr. Downie says that she’s seen patients with scarring after a dermaplaning session gone wrong. Although some medical spas offer dermaplaning, Dr. Downie recommends seeing a professional board-certified dermatologist for this kind of procedure. Board certification is an extra certification step that shows a physician completed advanced training in their specialty. (You can find a board-certified specialist by visiting The American Academy of Dermatology website.)\r\n\r\n***\\*How often should you have dermaplaning done?\\****\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the hair away, you might have to get treated about once a month. (Of course, the exact timeline will look different for each person.) Dr. Kim says this is not a treatment you should do too frequently. Our epidermis helps protect us from allergens and other potential irritants in the outside world—dermaplaning too often may irritate or damage that top layer of protection, she says. Again, this is why it’s best to consult with a physician who can help you decide on the appropriate frequency for your skin and needs.\r\n\r\n***\\*When should you avoid dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nThere are a few instances where you should think twice before signing up for dermaplaning. If you have acne, there is a chance that the blade could nick a pimple, says Dr. Downie, which means it would take longer to heal. So if you have something like a serious cystic breakout happening, it might be best to postpone. Ideally, you want to consult with a doctor who has experience with acne-prone patients. Also, tell your dermatologist if you have a history of cold sores. “If you have a breakout of cold sores, you need to be on Valtrex, and the physician ne eds to avoid the area,” says Dr. Downie. Without the use of a preventive oral anti-herpes medication, the cold sores can spread due to microtears in the skin.\r\n\r\n***\\*Is there anything else to know about dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nAfter a dermaplaning treatment, you do need to take care of your skin. “You have to coat your skin with sunblock afterwards because you’re going to be more sensitive to the sun,” says Dr. Downie. “You also have to be cautious of retinol and glycolic acids.” Dermatologists recommend that people with sensitive skin use a light moisturizer like Vanicream ($36, Amazon) because it doesn’t contain fragrances or other irritants. If you do choose to try dermaplaning, just be sure to work with a professional dermatologist for the safest possible experience.\r\n\r\nAll products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (118, 14, 'How to Manage Retinization When Using Retinoids', 'The first month on retinoids can be brutal.', '![img](/resources/images/wps2.png)\r\n\r\nBeauty editors praise retinoids for being a skin-care ingredient that seemingly does it all. They’re powerful enough to decrease acne, pigmentation, and wrinkles. But first comes the retinization period, where you might experience reddened, peeling, and dry skin. During this time, your skin is adjusting to the medication, and let’s not mince words, it sucks.\r\n\r\nIf you previously tried retinoids but thought they weren’t for you because of the side effects, then we have some good news: You can try again if you want. “Almost everyone can use retinoids if you tailor it to yourself,” Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D, professor of Dermatology, Medicine, and Nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, tells SELF. The key is figuring out the right strength and how often you can use it, she says. Even most of her patients with rosacea or sensitive skin can generally use a mild retinoid sparingly, she explains.\r\n\r\nWe spoke to a few experts about what you should know about retinoids and tips to keep in mind.\r\n\r\n1. What are retinoids, and why should you use them?\r\n\r\nThere’s a good chance you’ve heard of “retinols,” and you might be wondering if they are different from retinoids. It’s easiest to think of retinoids as a family of compounds derived from vitamin A, explains Dr. Kim. Then, there are retinols, or a form of retinoids commonly found in over-the-counter skin care products, and retinoic acid, found in prescription medications. But again, these are all forms of vitamin A, which can help your skin cells turn over more quickly when applied topically.\r\n\r\n“It’s very confusing because people just call everything retinols, but there are differences,” says Dr. Kim. The most important thing for you to remember is that retinoic acid requires a prescription and retinols can be found in products at your drugstore. Retin-A, or tretinoin as it’s called generically, is one popular brand of prescription retinoic acid.\r\n\r\nRetinoids may reduce wrinkles because they activate your skin’s natural collagen and elastin (two fibers that keep it strong). They’re also good exfoliators since they force your skin cells to turn over more quickly, which helps reduce acne, says Dr. Kim. In six to eight weeks, retinoids can clear up and prevent acne, reduce the look of fine lines, and lighten hyperpigmentation until it disappears. But prescription retinoids are strong stuff, so your skin is likely to get sensitive and irritated as it gets used to their mechanisms of action. Over-the-counter retinols can cause light irritation, but it\'s less severe since they are formulated to be gentler than prescription options. Because retinols are weaker, you may not notice skin changes, e.g., less acne, for several months, Dr. Kim says.\r\n\r\n2. What is retinization?\r\n\r\nLike we said, retinization is that period where your skin is adjusting to the retinoids. Generally, your skin may feel irritated, dry, and begin peeling, explains Dr. Kim. It starts a few days after you first start applying the medication and can last about a month (give or take a couple weeks) while your skin builds up a tolerance. Even people with sensitive skin can generally use some form of retinoids, says Dr. Kim. However, they might need to try the following skin care strategies to help reduce irritation, especially if using a prescription retinoid. Or, people with sensitive skin may need to try over-the-counter retinols since these are less irritating. Dr. Kim likes Differin Gel ($16, Amazon.com) since it was previously available by prescription and has been well-tested. As with most health concerns, it is best to consult with a dermatologist who can help you develop a plan that works for your specific skin. Right now, many physicians are offering virtual appointments using video chat. (Here’s what you need to know about scheduling medical appointments during COVID-19).\r\n\r\n3. Prepare your skin before starting retinoids.\r\n\r\nThe best prep you can do for your new retinoid regimen is to make sure your face isn’t dehydrated. “Moisturized skin has a better barrier function,” meaning that it’s at peak protection for whatever you throw at it, Beverly Hills dermatologist and founder of SkinxFive Ava Shamban, M.D., tells SELF. She says that means starting on a solid moisturization routine—morning and night—at least a week or so before you begin using the medication.\r\n\r\n4. Apply moisturizer before your retinoid at night.\r\n\r\nLayering the retinoid over a gentle moisturizer will help temper any irritation. Look for a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, ceramides, antioxidants, or redness-relieving peptides. Finding the right moisturizer for your particular skin type isn’t always easy. You can read our guide on moisturizer if you need help finding a product you like. The CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Lotion ($18, Amazon.com) is one dermatologist-recommended pick that works well for combination skin, for instance.\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nNote: The skin around your eyes is extra sensitive, and you shouldn’t apply retinoids to the upper eyelids at the risk of getting product in your eye. Protect the entire eye area with a thick moisturizer before putting retinoids on the rest of your face.\r\n\r\n5. Don’t start by applying retinoids every day.\r\n\r\nRetinoids aren’t something you should apply every day from the start. You have to work your way up to regular use. “Start slowly applying twice per week and then gradually add another day until you have built up tolerance for daily use,” RealSelf dermatologist Michele Green, M.D., tells SELF. If your skin has an adverse reaction, such as excessive peeling, lay off the treatment for a couple days. Then, you can try again but decrease the amount of times you use it per week. For example, if you experienced irritation after using it four times in a week, then bump your frequency down to three and see how your skin reacts. Some people can only tolerate using retinoids about twice a week, explains Dr. Kim.\r\n\r\n6. Change to a simple skin-care routine.\r\n\r\nFor the first month of regular retinoid use, your skin is officially classified as “sensitive.” That means you need to change up your cleansing and exfoliating routine. “Using a gentle detergent cleanser will allow some natural oils to remain on the skin, reducing the likelihood of developing the irritant dermatitis,” says Dr. Shamban. She says to look for something that is cream-based like Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser ($10, Amazon.com).\r\n\r\nAlso give up your masks, peels, and exfoliating scrubs. “Retinol will naturally exfoliate the skin,” says Dr. Shamban. “There is no reason to do any kind of a manual dermabrasion or exfoliating.” Dr. Green adds that you should avoid applying any other skin-care products with retinol, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and glycolic acid as they can be too harsh on your skin during retinization.\r\n\r\n7. Treat dry patches with extra moisturizer.\r\n\r\nDry patches and peeling will likely happen when you use retinoids. Dr. Shamban recommends applying aloe gel or 1 percent hydrocortisone cream like CeraVe Anti-Itch Cream ($9, Amazon.com) during the day to help with flakiness and irritation.\r\n\r\n8. Be patient about your results.\r\n\r\n“In dermatology, people want to do something once and that’s it,” says Dr. Kim. However, she says that you need to be patient and play the long game when it comes to retinoids. “You want to use this for a long time to really see the benefit of what these can do for your skin,” she says. So if a prescription retinoid is irritating, then you may want to use a weaker retinol. Or your doctor may be able to prescribe you a lower-dose retinoid that your skin tolerates.\r\n\r\n9. Call your dermatologist if you’re in pain.\r\n\r\nYes, some redness and itchiness are expected, but if you have an extreme reaction, it needs professional attention. “If your face starts to look like a charred tomato, it’s time to back off and see a physician,” Dr. Shamban says. Dr. Green seconds this sentiment, “If the skin starts to crack and you have open lesions which are oozing, you should definitely stop using the product and see your dermatologist. Also, if you develop a rash, this could mean you are having an allergic reaction to the product.” Again, you may not feel comfortable with physical office visits right now. But your dermatologist may be able to provide care through a virtual session, so it’s worth calling their office to check.\r\n\r\nAdditional reporting by Melissa Matthews\r\n\r\nAll products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (119, 14, '10 Things to Know Before Trying Dermal Fillers', 'Read this before making your appointment.', '![img](/resources/images/wps3.png) \r\n\r\nOur bodies naturally change with age, and those differences might include new wrinkles on our faces or cheekbones that aren’t as high as they once were. Dermal fillers can help minimize these signs of aging if you’re unhappy with them.\r\n\r\nHowever, these changes are completely normal and occur when we lose some of the subcutaneous fat that supports our skin. Over time, the skin on the middle of our faces shifts down too, causing our cheeks to sag a bit, explains Mary Stevenson, M.D., dermatologist at NYU Langone Health. “Filler can be used to help lift and add support,” she tells SELF. It can also help soften wrinkles, Dr. Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nThere are several categories of dermal fillers, and they’re all generally administered in the same way (more on that in a bit). Before electing to have any type of cosmetic or medical procedure, it’s important to understand what the process entails and any potential risks. Understandably, you might also have concerns about visiting a doctor’s office during the pandemic. Our story about making medical appointments during COVID-19 can help you decide if now is the right time to schedule an elective procedure. But below, you’ll find information experts think you should know about dermal fillers\r\n\r\n1. What exactly are dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nFirst things first: Dermal fillers are not to be confused with Botox, injectable drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to smooth lines and wrinkles. The latter \"freezes\" muscles to reduce wrinkles, while dermal fillers are injectable implants approved by the FDA to help smooth skin and wrinkles. As the name implies, they are injected beneath your skin using a needle.\r\n\r\nAccording to the FDA, there are four categories of fillers. Each is named for the type of material they’re made with:\r\n\r\nHyaluronic acid is naturally produced by your body and already found in your skin and cartilage. Generally, fillers made with hyaluronic acid last between 6-12 months.\r\n\r\nCalcium hydroxylapatite is a mineral that is found in our bones. Fillers made with this material last up to 18 months.\r\n\r\nPoly-L-lactic acid is a biodegradable synthetic material that’s also used to make medical products like dissolvable stitches. These fillers may last up to two years.\r\n\r\nPolymethylmethacrylate beads are the only filler that can’t be absorbed by your body, meaning the results are permanent. They’re only used around the mouth.\r\n\r\nHyaluronic acid, which you may recognize as a common ingredient in some skincare products, is one of the most popular types of fillers, explains Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D, professor of dermatology, medicine, and nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Because it helps skin retain moisture, hyaluronic acid can make your face look more plump and hydrated. It\'s also used in lotions as a moisturizer, but no cream can restore lost volume—only injectable hyaluronic acid can do that. Juvéderm and Restylane are two popular name brand hyaluronic fillers that you may have heard of.\r\n\r\n2. How do I know which dermal filler to try?\r\n\r\nA good doctor will explain the ideal treatment plan for you, but know that the most natural-looking results may require more than one type of filler. There are many different brands of fillers within each category, and the products vary in how they should be used—like filling out cheeks—and concentration of the active ingredient, explains Dr. Kim. For example, Restylane, one brand of hyaluronic filler, has five different lines—and each is used for different reasons. \"Restylane Lyft has larger particle sizes—think of them like the bricks of a foundation,\" Whitney Bowe, M.D. a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, tells SELF. Those larger particles have the heft to \"rebuild\" thinned cheekbones, while a smaller particle size, as in Restylane Silk, works better for addressing fine lines and plumping lips.\r\n\r\n3. Why do people get dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nDr. Kim explains that patients come to her saying “they just want to look a little better,” without turning to cosmetic surgery. She uses dermal fillers to add in volume and smooth out wrinkles, which her patients are normally happy with, she says.\r\n\r\nWATCH\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nDermal fillers are particularly popular because patients see differences in their appearances before leaving her office, Dr. Kim says. Generally, people notice the desired changes from other non-surgical procedures, like Botox, after a few days.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note: Dermal fillers are not FDA-approved for body contouring procedures. In other words, they shouldn’t be used to increase the size of your breasts or butt.\r\n\r\n4. What precautions should I take before getting fillers?\r\n\r\nIt probably goes without saying, but safety should be your top priority when considering any medical procedure. Dr. Kim says visiting a board-certified dermatologist or a board-certified plastic surgeon is one way to ensure that your physician is experienced. This extra certification step shows that the doctor completed additional training in their particular specialty. (You can find a board-certified specialist by visiting The American Board of Plastic Surgery or the American Academy of Dermatology websites.) Even though dermal fillers are available at medical spas, you should see only licensed and trained physicians for any injectable treatment. There are risks for issues like infection, discoloration, and lumps if injections are done incorrectly.\r\n\r\nGiven that this is a cosmetic procedure, you understandably want to be satisfied with the results. One way to find a doctor whose work you like is by asking friends who have had this done for their recommendations. \"People are starting to be more open about injectables,\" Ava Shamban, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist in Los Angeles, tells SELF.\r\n\r\n5. What should I ask my doctor during the consultation?\r\n\r\n“I think as a patient you should always ask for a consultation first and then really talk about what your goal is and how they [the doctor] can help you,” says Dr. Kim. You may think you just want dermal fillers, but an expert could recommend another treatment—or a combination of treatments—based on your specific skin type and goals. For example, your doctor may suggest using laser therapy if you have a lot of pigmentation, she says.\r\n\r\nDr. Shamban advises requesting before-and-after photographs of real patients from the doctor’s office. Every practitioner has different philosophies, techniques, and levels of experience. And don\'t be afraid to ask about your doctor’s training and certification during the initial consultation.\r\n\r\nLastly, you and your physician should communicate about realistic results and your expectations—it\'s your face, after all.\r\n\r\n6. What are the possible side effects of fillers?\r\n\r\nEven non-surgical procedures have their risks. The most common side effects include bruising, redness, pain, or swelling, all of which should go away within two weeks, according to the FDA. Less frequently, people might get raised bumps under their skin that need to be treated with injections, medications, or even surgically removed, according to the FDA.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is rare, filler can accidentally be injected into a blood vessel and lead to blurred vision or permanent blindness. You should call your doctor or the emergency room if your skin turns blue and you’re in a lot of pain—these are two possible signs that filler is in your bloodstream. Again, this is why you want to see an experienced doctor who is skilled in performing the procedure.\r\n\r\n7. Who should avoid dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nAccording to the FDA, there’s no research showing that dermal fillers are safe for pregnant or breastfeeding people, so you may want to hold off if you’re expecting a baby or recently had a child. And here\'s one more thing to consider: Avoid getting filler right before a teeth cleaning or other dental treatment, Dr. Shamban says. These procedures require pressure and stretching of the face that could potentially misplace fillers. You can ask your doctor for their opinion regarding when it’s safe to get any future dental work during your consultation.\r\n\r\n8. How much do dermal fillers cost?\r\n\r\nIf the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. If you see a deal for inexpensive filler, be skeptical. \"You have to be careful,\" Dr. Shamban says, adding that counterfeit and diluted filler do exist. \"Ask to see the box, and look for a safety seal on it.\" The price of these fillers varies depending on the amount of product needed. In 2019, the average cost of hyaluronic acid fillers was $652 per syringe, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. They estimate that most patients need more than one syringe to achieve the results they’re looking for.\r\n\r\n9. Are dermal fillers permanent?\r\n\r\nIf you\'re unhappy with the way filler looks, don\'t panic—in most cases, you can have it adjusted. A dermatologist might inject additional filler for balance, or they can dissolve it altogether, depending on the type. \"The wonderful thing about hyaluronic acid fillers is that there\'s an enzyme that can be injected into the area to dissolve the product,\" Dr. Shamban says. \"It just goes away.\"\r\n\r\nBut when expertly injected, filler should look natural. \"The changes we can make are so subtle that nobody would notice,\" says Dr. Shamban. \r\n\r\n10. How long will the results last?\r\n\r\nSince the majority of fillers aren’t permanent, you\'ll have to keep going back to the doctor’s office if you love the results following your procedure. After about six months, your body naturally breaks down hyaluronic acid fillers. So, you have to get touch-ups once or twice a year to maintain the look. However, this is good news if you just want to try fillers once or twice, since the effects will fade away without any long-term risks.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:19:50', '2021-05-28 19:19:51', '/resources/images/wps3.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/dermal-fillers', 1, 0);

Whether it’s 100 degrees and humid or pouring rain, I make sure that my face is saturated with a healthy dollop of sun protection before leaving the house. I thought I’d discovered all my skin-care favorites—until I tried Supergoop!

Play, which is suitable for both face and body. Typically I’m wary of two-in-one skin products (I don’t fully endorse the idea of body wash that also works for your face, for example). But I was willing to give this a shot because I love Supergoop!—and it didn’t disappoint.\r\n\r\nI totally get why this is called Everyday Lotion, since its consistency is just as creamy and lightweight as some of my favorite moisturizers.

It’s nongreasy with a pleasantly mild scent, and my skin drinks this stuff up with little effort. Supergoop! Play\'s chameleon-like ability to work on both my face and body without triggering breakouts is truly a game changer, and I no longer have to bother switching between a bunch of sun-protection products on the regular. \r\n\r\nSince Supergoop! Play offers broad-spectrum SPF 50 protection, plus has a water- and sweat-resistant formula, I don’t worry about it wearing off during outdoor workouts. I can happily wear it in the ocean and actually feel good about it, as it is now officially a reef-safe sunscreen, meaning it doesn’t contain chemical UV filters like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are known to be harmful to coral reefs and other sea life. \r\n\r\nNow that I’ve added this new gold star to my list of skin-care go-tos, I’m ready to graduate from the handheld 2.4-ounce size right to the jumbo, easy-to-pump 18-ounce version.

She sought out the treatment to help manage her melasma, a skin condition often associated with pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIn the IGTV post, Mitchell starts with a mirror selfie showing off her comfy outfit (and mask!). She announces that this is her first melasma treatment and offers some background information about melasma and IPL treatments. Then, after a quick shot of her face with numbing cream, Mitchell takes a moment to show the camera her “little melasma spot” just below her eye and points to a patch of melasma on her upper lip. “Especially for new moms,” she says. “We go out in the sun and this is what happens.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Mitchell says she was too nervous to take video during the actual treatment, immediately after it she reports that her face is numb and that the IPL felt like “a million little elastic bands hitting all over.” She also points out a few red areas on her face that the treatment had targeted. Her facial treatment continues with a soothing collagen mask.\r\n\r\nThen, Mitchell cuts to an update from a week after her first treatment. She seems happy with the results so far. Although she says it’s recommended to get another one or two treatments, after the first one she feels that “we’re on track to lightening these little guys up.”\r\n\r\nMelasma is a form of hyperpigmentation that frequently shows up during or after pregnancy. The condition is so frequently associated with pregnancy that it’s sometimes even called the mask of pregnancy, SELF explained previously. It usually causes patches of brown or grayish-brown skin on the cheeks, forehead, nose, upper lip, and chin. Those patches aren’t harmful or painful, and sometimes, they’ll fade away on their own. But some people may want to have them lightened or removed.\r\n\r\nFirst off, as Mitchell points out, melasma is exacerbated by UV exposure, so wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 is usually a mainstay of melasma treatment and maintenance. Plus, recent research suggests that those with melasma may benefit from using a sunscreen containing iron oxides, which help block visible light from the sun and devices, like your phone or laptop.\r\n\r\nFrom there, treatment usually involves topical medications, such as prescription hydroquinone, which can lighten skin, the American Academy of Dermatology explains. Tretinoin, a powerful retinoid that speeds up the cell turnover process, is another common choice, as are corticosteroid medications and azelaic acid. \r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nBut topical medications aren’t always enough, which is where treatments like the one Mitchell received come in. For more stubborn melasma, a dermatologist might recommend in-office procedures like microdermabrasion, chemical peels, or laser treatments. The specific treatment Mitchell got—IPL—is similar to laser treatments but involves the use of multiple light wavelengths to treat certain issues. It’s especially useful in managing hyperpigmentation, broken blood vessels sometimes seen in rosacea, and age spots.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that nonablative treatments like this stimulate the growth of new collagen by heating up the skin, SELF explained previously. However, for most skin conditions, multiple treatments are required for you to see noticeable results. Mitchell specifically mentions in her video that she’s hoping her melasma spots will look lighter after three sessions.\r\n\r\nAfter treatment, it’s normal for the skin to be a little red, swollen, and sensitive for a few hours or a few days, Baylor College of Medicine explains.

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (122, 14, 'Here’s Why You Get Sun Spots on Your Face—And How to Treat Them', 'They’re usually harmless.', '![img](/resources/images/wps8.png) \r\n\r\nIf you’ve spent any time in the sun throughout your life, you may have developed some sun spots on your face. These spots (also called age spots, liver spots, or solar lentigines) appear as flat, smooth brown spots on areas of your skin that tend to get a lot of sun exposure.\r\n\r\nSun spots are generally harmless areas of pigmented skin, but they can be easily confused with other types of sun-related spots on the skin, including some that may actually be a sign of skin cancer. If you think you have sun spots on your face, it’s important to monitor them and to get anything that looks iffy checked out by a board-certified dermatologist.\r\n\r\nHere’s what you need to know about sun spots, how to prevent them, how dermatologists can treat or remove them, and signs to look for that may signal an issue.\r\n\r\nWhat causes sun spots on your face?\r\n\r\nSun spots on your face are a type of hyperpigmentation caused by UV exposure. Essentially, after being exposed to the sun, your skin increases production of melanin, the pigment that gives skin color. Over time, some areas of your skin may develop clumps of melanin or may overproduce that pigment, resulting in a sun spot, the Mayo Clinic explains.\r\n\r\nThese types of spots tend to show up on areas of your body where you get the most sun, which might include your face, shoulders, hands, chest, and the back of your hands, Mary L. Stevenson, M.D., assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. Sun spots tend to be flat rather than raised, are usually brown, and may appear in clusters.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to prevent sun spots?\r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent sun spots on your face is to develop and maintain solid sun safety habits. “They can be prevented with diligent sun protection including use of sunscreen on regular basis, and other forms of sun protection like hats, sun glasses, and clothing,” Nada Elbuluk, M.D., clinical assistant professor of dermatology (clinician educator), Keck School of Medicine of USC, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nThat includes using broad spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) every day, particularly on areas of your body that are prone to sun exposure, like your face, your shoulders, and the back of your hands. Sun spots are more likely to show up on people with lighter skin, Elbuluk says, but people with darker skin tones can still develop sun-related skin damage, so it’s important for everyone to wear sunscreen regularly.\r\n\r\nBut we know that it’s a bit difficult to stick to diligent sunscreen wearing (and reapplication) habits—and even perfect sunscreen usage doesn’t protect you from 100% of the sun’s rays. That’s why it’s crucial to also use other sun protection strategies, like wearing sun-protective clothing, sticking to the shade whenever possible, and wearing hats and sunglasses that block the sun.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nEltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 ($38, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nNeutrogena Ultra-Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreen SPF 30 ($10, Amazon)\r\n\r\nLa Roche Posay Anthelios Mineral Sunscreen Gentle Lotion SPF 50 ($22, Amazon)\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to treat sun spots?\r\n\r\nTrue sun spots are not harmful and don\'t need to be treated. If you do decide you want to have your sun spots treated or removed for cosmetic reasons, this is something you’ll likely have to see a professional about. Although you can certainly try some products containing the classic brightening ingredients, like hydroquinone, retinoids, or vitamin C, “over-the-counter products are typically not strong enough to have a significant effect on sun spots,” Elbuluk explains.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nAlthough some of those products can be helpful in preventing sun spots and generally evening out your skin tone, they aren’t likely to be enough once you have the spots, Stevenson says. So if you want to have a sun spot removed, you’ll need to talk to a board-certified dermatologist. They may recommend using a prescription-strength lightening cream or procedures such as professional chemical peels or laser treatments, Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nAfter a laser treatment, the spot will usually “turn a little white, crust, and then peel off,” Stevenson explains, so that you’re left with a subtly pink area that eventually fades. After doing all that work to have the spot removed, it’s really important to keep it from getting any more sun, she says, especially while it’s still healing, because laser treatments can make your skin more sensitive to sun exposure. In fact, Stevenson says she generally doesn’t treat sun spots during the summer because of this risk for more pigmentation after treatment. \r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes other types of spots (called seborrheic keratoses) are confused with sun spots, Stevenson says. Seborrheic keratoses, like sun spots, are harmless brown, tan, or black growths on the skin, the Mayo Clinic explains. However, unlike true sun spots, these marks tend to be slightly raised, which means they may need to be shaved down or destroyed with electrocautery. These procedures may then be combined with laser treatments to further remove the pigment. Many people who are prone to sun spots are also prone to seborrheic keratoses, so it’s common to have both Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nHyperpigmentation on the face might also be melasma, a condition that tends to appear in patches on the cheeks, forehead, nose, or chin, SELF explained previously.\r\n\r\nWhen should you talk to a dermatologist?\r\n\r\nAlthough true sun spots aren’t harmful, they are a result of sun damage and therefore can be a sign that you need to get better at protecting yourself from sun exposure.\r\n\r\nSometimes, cancerous spots on your skin can look like sun spots or seborrheic keratoses, the Mayo Clinic says. So if you have a lot of sun spots or you notice one that looks suspicious or odd, it’s always a good idea to get checked out by a dermatologist. \r\n\r\nIn particular, it’s important to take note of any spots that seem to be growing or changing rapidly. “If [you have] a brown spot that seems to be changing in size, color, or appearance, then it may not be a sun spot and should be examined by a board-certified dermatologist to rule out skin cancer,” Elbuluk says.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:20:57', '2021-05-28 19:20:59', '/resources/images/wps8.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/sun-spots-on-face', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (123, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Spider Veins and Varicose Veins', 'This isn’t a DIY situation.', '![img](/resources/images/wps9.png)\r\n\r\nIf you’re wondering how to get rid of spider veins, you’ve probably already come across a bunch of the internet’s suggestions. When I noticed a series of faint blue lines twisting around my thigh, some of the recommended home remedies I saw included ginger tea, massage, and even exercise. But here’s the honest truth: That’s all B.S. Visible veins aren’t something you can fix at home.\r\n\r\nSo I talked to dermatologists and surgeons who specialize in treating spider veins and varicose veins (the larger, raised visible veins that often appear on the legs). What I learned is that the underlying causes of these visible veins aren’t always preventable—and they can be a sign of a much deeper vein problem that no home remedy is likely to fix. Here’s how to get rid of spider veins for real—and why it’s so important to see a specialist to do so.\r\n\r\nWhat actually are spider veins?\r\n\r\nThere are two common types of visible veins: spider veins and varicose veins. “Spider veins are really small superficial veins that are in the outer layer of skin between the dermis and epidermis, so you can see them,” Christopher Hollingsworth, M.D., a general surgeon at NYC Surgical Associates, tells SELF. “If you live long enough, most people are going to get them.” These veins get their name because they look like thin, weblike, blue-and-purple lines on the legs.\r\n\r\nVaricose veins, on the other hand, are larger veins that are deeper in the body. “You won’t see them as a discoloration, you’ll see them when they get so stretched out that they kind of bulge,” Dr. Hollingsworth says.\r\n\r\nBecause these two issues are caused by similar blood-flow situations, varicose and spider veins commonly occur together. That means that people who have varicose veins almost always have spider veins too. However, some people get spider veins and never have a problem with varicose veins.\r\n\r\nWhat causes spider veins and other visible veins?\r\n\r\nTo understand why these visible veins develop, you’ve got to understand how blood flows through the body. Your heart pumps blood to your entire body through your blood vessels. From there, blood circulates outward toward the extremities (legs, arms, head) through the arteries and back inward to the heart through your veins.\r\n\r\n“Think of veins as being a hose that flows from bottom-up toward your heart,” says dermatologist Alicia Barba, M.D., of Barba Dermatology. “And there’s a little valve. When they work well, the blood shoots up and the valve closes. When it doesn’t work, the blood falls back down instead of moving north.”\r\n\r\nWhen blood flows in the wrong direction because of a valve problem, it can get backed up in the veins of the legs, which damages the walls of the vein, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) explains. That extra pressure on the vein walls gradually causes them to weaken and then bulge, creating veins we can actually see. In fact, the majority of people who have spider veins and/or varicose veins will be dealing with this type of “venous insufficiency,” Dr. Hollingsworth says.\r\n\r\nHowever, other factors can contribute to the likelihood that you’ll develop visible veins, including genetics, age, and your level of physical activity, the AAD says.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you have a job where you are standing still for long periods of time, gravity is at work pulling the blood back down toward the legs, causing the veins to get stretched out and the valves to weaken over time. If you sit all day at your job, you can also start to see visible veins because there is a lack of muscle movement. The muscles in the leg help the veins push the blood back up toward the heart, so moving around during the day can help prevent visible veins. (That rumor that crossing your legs can cause spider veins isn’t true, so go ahead and cross ’em if you like—just make sure that you get out of your chair and move around during the day to get the blood pumping.)\r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nThere is some research to suggest that carrying extra weight can impact the function of your veins and, therefore, also increase your risk for visible veins. Having more fat around your stomach (visceral fat) can increase the pressure in your abdomen, Dr. Hollingsworth says, which then creates an obstruction that blocks the flow of blood. “That increased pressure dilates the veins, which extends all the way through the lower vein bridge and all the way up to the veins in your skin,” he explains.\r\n\r\nA similar situation happens during pregnancy when the added pressure in the abdomen squeezes the veins. But the hormonal shifts that happen during pregnancy may also play a role. “When women are exposed to excess estrogen or progesterone, what it tends to do is make your soft tissue a little more flexible,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. “That same process, we think, is affecting the veins, making them predisposed to dilate and stretch out.” After pregnancy, the veins generally go away and everything returns to normal. This vein weakening can also happen if you’re taking hormonal birth control.\r\n\r\nAlthough visible veins may seem like a purely superficial issue, they can become painful when left untreated. “Spider and varicose veins make your legs sore because it’s an inflammatory process,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. “Those veins are getting dilated and stretched out. They’re trying to signal for help in the only way they know how, which is sending off a local inflammatory biochemical that causes your legs to swell and to be sore.” So preventing and treating spider veins can save you from a lot of discomfort.\r\n\r\nCan you do anything to prevent spider veins?\r\n\r\nThere are a few different underlying causes of vein issues that are preventable or reversible, while others aren\'t. For instance, if your visible veins are largely due to inherited factors, pregnancy, or how active you can be during the work day, that’s not likely something you have a ton of control over.\r\n\r\nBut there are some general things you can do to prevent them, such as maintaining physical activity during the day. If you sit at work all day, the AAD recommends getting up and walking around a bit every 30 minutes. Or, if you stand at work for long periods of time, the AAD recommends taking a break and sitting down every 30 minutes. And exercising in general, elevating your legs when possible, and avoiding soaking for long periods of time in hot baths can help prevent visible veins as well, the AAD says.\r\n\r\nHowever, these strategies can’t treat any visible veins you already have.\r\n\r\nYou’ll need to see a specialist to actually treat visible veins.\r\n\r\nIf you’re wondering how to get rid of spider veins for good, know that Dr. Hollingsworth says those wacky home remedies won’t work. Dry brushing? Nope. Fancy body lotions? Nah. Massage? It might feel good, but there won’t be a visible difference.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing really that you can do aside from the small minimally invasive treatments we have that is going to make spider veins look any better,” he says. “Creams, ointments, or rubbing aren’t going to make spider veins go away.”\r\n\r\nThe primary way that spider and varicose veins are treated is by using different surgical methods to close off the vein so that it collapses and the residual scar tissue stops the blood flow completely. These are all superficial veins, so other healthy veins just take over their circulation duties and the procedure won’t impact your overall health. Also, those with more serious, bulging varicose veins can have them removed completely once the vein is closed off.\r\n\r\nSclerotherapy: This is one of the more popular options for spider veins and varicose veins. A doctor injects a foamy detergent or concentrated saltwater solution into the problematic vein, which irritates the walls of the blood vessel, explains Neil Sadick, M.D., founder of Sadick Dermatology. This causes scar tissue to form, which leads the blood vessel to close. If someone is allergic to the sclerotherapy solution, there are other treatment options.\r\n\r\nLaser treatment: A vein surgeon or dermatologist might use a laser treatment to heat the vein, causing it to contract and scar over. Dr Hollingsworth uses a handheld Nd:YAG laser (the same machine that can be used in laser hair removal) on small spider veins. Or, if it’s a larger varicose vein, a laser may be inserted into the vein using a catheter to stop blood flow.\r\n\r\nMedical glue: For varicose veins, doctors might also use is the medical version of superglue. “Cyanoacrylate glue is a biologic glue that’s very similar to Krazy Glue,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. Surgeons close off a varicose vein by gluing it shut from the inside. “You inject it, wait for the glue to set, and move further down, and so on and so on.”\r\n\r\nRadio frequency ablation (RFA): This is another option for varicose veins that are so large that glue and sclero just float away. “RFA runs radio frequency through the inside of the vein and turns the inside of the vein into a lightbulb filament, heats it up, scars it, and kills it,” says Dr. Hollingsworth.\r\n\r\nTo prevent visible veins from getting worse, a surgeon might use RFA or internal laser techniques to close off a larger vein deeper in the leg that feeds the smaller varicose veins and spider veins. “There’s a central pipe in the leg called the saphenous vein; it’s the main superficial vein. Coming off those veins are truncal varicose veins,” Dr. Sadick says. Once the larger vein is taken care of, the smaller veins can be treated with sclerotherapy, glue, or a handheld laser.\r\n\r\nAll of these treatments are performed through tiny punctures in the skin, so you can likely schedule your procedure in the morning and go back to work in the afternoon. However, Dr. Barba warns about getting these treatments on darker skin tones, especially laser and RFA procedures, because those with darker skin tones have a higher risk for hyperpigmentation issues following the treatments. Plus, those pigmentation issues can be stubborn to treat. “Sometimes the pigmentation is a part of the healing process,” Dr. Barba says. “If you care about a little spider vein, you might care about the pigment that’s going to be there for a couple months.”\r\n\r\nWhatever treatment you go with, the key is to go to a doctor who specializes in vein treatments, whether that’s a dermatologist or a vein surgeon. “If you want have anything done, go to whoever does a lot of it,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. The good news is that insurance will cover many vein treatments. Without insurance, these treatments can cost $300 to $8,000. “Oftentimes, when it is a deeper vein problem, insurance covers it because it\'s not [just] a cosmetic issue,” Dr. Barba says.\r\n\r\nHow can you prevent spider veins from coming back?\r\n\r\nAlthough effective, all of these surgical treatments are really temporary fixes, Dr. Hollingsworth says. Spider and varicose veins can return in other nearby veins once the original veins are closed off or removed. So, if you decide not to treat them at all, they can multiply, Dr. Hollingsworth says. But if you stay on top of them—which will require repeated treatments every one to two years—you can keep them at bay.\r\n\r\nAfter treatment, one thing you can do to effectively prevent spider veins from returning is to wear compression stockings daily, which can be difficult to get on and uncomfortable to wear. \"Nobody likes wearing them,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. But, “if you wear stockings religiously during the day, they significantly reduce [the chance that] your spider veins [will come] back.” In some cases, your health insurance may actually cover the cost of medical-grade compression stockings, Medline Plus explains, so check with them before buying any.\r\n\r\nUltimately, if you’re dealing with spider veins or varicose veins, it’s important to check in with a doctor or dermatologist. They can help you understand how serious your particular issue is, talk about what may underlying issues may have caused it, and, if necessary, walk you through your treatment options.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:21:21', '2021-05-28 19:21:23', '/resources/images/wps9.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/spider-and-varicose-veins', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (124, 14, 'How to Prevent—and Treat—That Pesky Mask Acne', 'Don’t let “maskne” keep you from wearing a mask.', '![img](/resources/images/wps10.jpg)\r\n\r\nFeel like your face mask is causing acne? You’re probably not imagining it. Not only is it becoming offensively hot and humid this summer, but we’re also wearing masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19—both of which may contribute to acne and other skin issues.\r\n\r\nBreakouts, in particular, have become so common that mask acne has been dubbed “maskne” on the internet. While you can’t ditch the mask, there are steps you can take to prevent and treat mask-related acne to enjoy a safe summer with healthy skin.\r\n\r\nWhat causes mask acne?\r\n\r\nAcne usually develops when pores get clogged by oil, dead skin cells, makeup, dirt, or bacteria. This can lead to blackheads, whiteheads, or pimples that can vary in size and type, depending on how infected they get.\r\n\r\nAdopting a simple skin-care routine—including cleansing, exfoliating, moisturizing, and wearing sunscreen—helps manage acne because it helps with the skin’s natural shedding process. Regular cleansing and exfoliating ensures that all that gunk and dead skin cells are removed rather than clogging your pores. Moisturizing and wearing sunscreen helps ensure the skin’s protective outer layer functions properly.\r\n\r\nBut wearing a face mask can interfere with that process. Instead of those dead skin cells shedding “throughout the day, they now get clogged in your pores,” Carrie L. Kovarik, M.D., an associate professor of dermatology at University of Pennsylvania and a member of the American Association of Dermatology’s (AAD) COVID-19 task force, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nMasks also provide the perfect humid environment for bacteria to grow in our skin, which can lead to a breakout, Noelani Gonzalez, M.D., director of cosmetic dermatology at Mount Sinai, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nHow can you treat mask acne?\r\n\r\nIf you’re dealing with an active mask acne breakout there are ways to treat it—and the methods aren’t so different from the way you’d treat regular acne.\r\n\r\nFor milder cases, classic over-the-counter acne-fighting ingredients like benzoyl peroxide (which kills the bacteria associated with acne) and salicylic acid (a chemical exfoliant that helps unclog pores, should be your go-tos, Dr. Gonzalez says. You can try using a benzoyl peroxide-containing spot treatment, such as Neutrogena On-the-Spot Acne Treatment ($6, Amazon) or La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Acne Treatment ($30, Amazon). And for salicylic acid products, look for gentle acne cleansers, such as Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser ($11, Ulta) or First Aid Beauty Acne Clearing Charcoal Cleanser ($24, Dermstore).\r\n\r\nBut for more severe acne, meaning it’s inflamed or you’re dealing with deep, cystic pimples, a dermatologist might prescribe other treatments such as anti-inflammatory cortisone creams or retinoid medications, which speed up the skin’s natural cell turnover process.\r\n\r\nHowever, both prescription and over-the-counter acne remedies can be irritating, especially if you have sensitive skin or you’re also dealing with raw, red, inflamed areas of skin. In these cases, a dermatologist may recommend you use acne treatments less frequently or hold off on treating the acne altogether until the raw areas of your skin heals. So the right treatment for you may depend on the exact type of problem you develop and your skin type.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve tried over-the-counter options without success, then it’s best to check in with a board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Gonzalez says. Many dermatologists are now offering video consultations as well.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to prevent mask acne?\r\n\r\nSince we’re going to be wearing masks for a while, managing mask acne isn’t going to be a one-time deal. It will require developing both treatment and ongoing prevention habits to keep your skin clear. And, because mask-related acne doesn’t just affect those who tend to be more acne-prone in general, dermatologists recommend that everyone practice good mask-wearing hygiene.\r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nThe first step is to choose a mask that allows your skin (and you) to breathe while also protecting others and yourself from the spread of coronavirus. To accomplish that, the mask should sit snugly but comfortably on your face and should cover both your mouth and nose, SELF explained previously.\r\n\r\n“I recommend soft fabrics, something like cotton or silk,” Dr. Gonzalez says. “They are materials that tend to be more gentle and breathable on the skin, versus synthetic materials that tend to be harsher on the skin.” Here are a few cloth masks to check out as well as recommendations for those looking to work out in a mask.\r\n\r\nAfter choosing a well-fitting mask that doesn’t irritate your skin, it’s time to think about what you put under it. Choosing skin care and makeup products that are labeled non-comedogenic or oil-free underneath the mask can help reduce chances of breakouts. But Dr. Gonzalez suggests avoiding makeup under your mask entirely—especially heavy foundations and multiple layers of products, which can clog pores and lead to acne.\r\n\r\nInstead, wear a moisturizer with at least SPF 30, Dr. Gonzalez says. Not only will this protect your skin from UV rays, but wearing sunscreen can also help prevent other mask-related skin issues, such as tan lines. And the moisturizing helps reduce friction and chafing.\r\n\r\nAfter a long day of wearing your mask, use a gentle cleanser to wash your face to remove all the accumulated debris and oil, Dr. Kovarik says. But dry skin is another common face mask-related skin issue, so make sure to moisturize immediately after washing your face. Kovarik recommends using a moisturizer with ceramides, which help lock moisture into your skin, and/or hyaluronic acid, which has a hydrating effect.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re thinking about adding anything new to your daily skin-care routine, Dr. Gonzalez recommends against starting any new harsh treatments for your skin. Adding products like harsh chemical peels can make the skin more sensitive “and should be avoided because that’ll make your skin more prone to breaking out,” she says.\r\n\r\nHow to wash your mask:\r\n\r\nYour face isn’t the only thing you need to wash! In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend washing cloth masks after each use, which helps remove oils and dead skin that collect inside the mask. To do so, use warm water and a gentle detergent that doesn’t irritate the skin.\r\n\r\nLook for detergents that are free of added colors and fragrances, which are common skin irritants, Dr. Kovarik says. This will ensure that you’re being gentle on sensitive or irritated skin and will reduce the chances of developing a reaction like contact dermatitis.\r\n\r\nAcne isn’t the only mask-related skin issue you might experience.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other skin issues that may arise during the summer of face masks. For instance, you may need to take extra care with your lips to prevent irritation. Unless you have a cone-shaped mask, “the lips are going to be the first thing your mask is going to touch,” Dr. Kovarik says. She recommends using a lip balm or Vaseline ($9 for a pack of 3, Amazon) to protect them.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you have a skin condition like rosacea or eczema, the irritation from face masks may trigger your symptoms. To manage that, definitely keep up the treatment plan that your dermatologist recommended for you, but get in touch with your derm if that plan is no longer enough to manage the flares.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:21:39', '2021-05-28 19:21:37', '/resources/images/wps10.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/mask-acne', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (125, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Back Acne for Good', 'And when to talk to a dermatologist.', '![img](/resources/images/wps11.png) \r\n\r\nFace acne is a common—and frustrating—skin condition to manage. And figuring out how to get rid of back acne is no different. For some people, back acne causes small pimples, while others deal with large cystic acne zits, which can be deep, painful, and pus-filled. And because back acne can be caused by external factors, particularly working out and wearing sweaty clothes, it can be stubborn to treat with the usual acne remedies—even if they work for the pimples on your face.\r\n\r\nSo what actually is back acne? And how can you treat it effectively? Here’s what you need to know about how to get rid of back acne for good.\r\n\r\nWhat causes back acne?\r\n\r\n“Acne is caused by increased oil production, bacteria, pore blockage, and irregular skin cell turnover,” board-certified dermatologist Eric Meinhardt, M.D., tells SELF, and that goes for your face and your back. Sebaceous glands in the skin produce oil, which can collect along with dead skin cells in the pores, plugging them up and giving bacteria a perfect breeding ground, all of which can lead to redness, whiteheads, blackheads, and sometimes infection.\r\n\r\nHormones can play a large role, which is why you might break out more around your period, for instance. And if you’ve noticed that your breakouts pop up in similar places as it does for other family members, that could signal that your acne has a hereditary component, Dr. Meinhardt says.\r\n\r\nWhile the root causes of zits are basically the same in both places, the skin on your face is very different from the skin on your back, which has its upsides and downsides. The skin on the face has more blood supply, Dr. Meinhardt says, which helps acne heal faster and reduces scarring. But the skin on the back is much thicker than the skin on the face (specifically the second layer, called the dermis). That means that the back is more resilient and can handle stronger treatments, scrubs, and exfoliants that would be considered too harsh for the face.\r\n\r\nHowever, not everything that looks like acne on your back is actually acne. For instance, so-called fungal acne tends to appear on the back and chest area and forms uniform red bumps. But traditional acne treatments won’t help manage it at all. So if you’re not sure what your issue really is, get checked out by a professional.\r\n\r\nHow can you treat—and prevent—back acne?\r\n\r\nTreating back acne can be a challenge, but there are some straightforward steps you can take at home that will help manage it, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). Here’s how to get rid of back acne for good:\r\n\r\nLook for benzoyl peroxide. Of all the over-the-counter acne medication options you have, the AAD suggests starting with benzoyl peroxide. This ingredient works by killing bacteria that fuel acne. The AAD recommends using a wash containing benzoyl peroxide by letting it sit on your skin for two to five minutes in the shower daily and then rinsing it off. They also suggest starting with a concentration of 5.3% and only going higher than that if a lower concentration isn’t enough. Although the skin on your back isn’t as sensitive as the skin on your face, high concentrations of benzoyl peroxide can cause side effects, so it’s still smart to start at a lower level and work your way up only if needed.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nPaula’s Choice Clear Extra Strength Daily Skin Clearing Treatment, $19, Amazon\r\n\r\nSLMD BP Body Wash, $35, Target\r\n\r\nPanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash 10%, $11, Target\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nTry a retinoid. Retinoids, particularly adapalene, are another great OTC option for treating acne. They work by speeding up the skin’s natural cell turnover process, which helps unclog pores and resolve acne more quickly. “Retinoids not only treat the acne you have today, they also change the way the cells turn over, reducing your development of acne tomorrow,” Heidi Waldorf, M.D., the director of laser and cosmetic dermatology at the Mount Sinai Hospital, tells SELF. These are especially effective when used alongside benzoyl peroxide, the AAD says. To make sure you don’t miss a spot when applying topical creams and gels, Waldorf recommends using an applicator like the L’applique to help you reach those hard-to-get-to areas.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nDifferin Gel, $15, Amazon\r\n\r\nLa Roche Posay Effaclar Adapalene Gel 0.1%, $30, Amazon\r\n\r\nAcne Free Adapalene Gel 0.1%, $12, Amazon\r\n\r\nSalicylic acid might work too. This classic acne-fighting ingredient works as a chemical exfoliant, breaking down dead skin cells and getting deep into pores to clear them out. It’s a common ingredient in spot treatments, but those might be hard to use on your back. “Salicylic acid is attracted to the oil in the sebaceous glands, and once there, it helps to loosen the sticky cells and oil to clear clogged hair follicles,” Dr. Waldorf says.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nNeutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, $7, Target\r\n\r\nMurad Acne Body Wash, $44, Murad\r\n\r\nDermaologica Clearing Skin Wash, $62, Ulta\r\n\r\nDevelop good workout habits. Working out and sweating can contribute to body acne, so it’s important to be mindful when you’re engaging in those activities. The AAD recommends opting for looser fitting clothes made of sweat-wicking fabric or cotton to avoid sweat accumulating next to your skin. It’s also important to change out of sweaty workout clothes as soon as possible and to wash them after every use.\r\n\r\nBe gentle with your skin. If your skin has acne, it will require a gentle touch. That means using a gentle body wash or cleanser—not a harsh scrub. It also means avoiding the very tempting urge to pick your acne as much as possible.\r\n\r\nWear sunscreen. Sun exposure can actually worsen acne and cause post-acne dark spots to become darker. Although wearing sunscreen is always important, it’s especially important if you’re trying to manage back acne. Look for products that are non-comedogenic and oil-free, which means they won’t contribute to clogged pores.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nEltaMD UV Lotion Broad-Spectrum SPF 30, $36, Dermstore\r\n\r\nHawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch Lotion Sunscreen SPF 50, $19, Amazon\r\n\r\nClinique Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Mineral Sunscreen For Body, $32, Sephora\r\n\r\nAvoid anything that rubs your skin. The friction caused by a backpack or or shoulder bag can worsen acne, especially if you’re also sweaty. If you can, hold your purse in your hand or rest the strap on your arm.\r\n\r\nTake care when washing your hair. The way you wash your hair can have an impact on bacne. While the oils in hair treatments might be good for nourishing your strands, they can be bad news for the skin on your back. That’s why Debbie Palmer, D.O., tells SELF that you should rinse conditioner off to the side instead of letting it run down your back. Also, try waiting until you’ve completed all of your hair treatments before washing your body. That way you can wash off any oily residue, clearing the way for your acne treatments to do their thing.\r\n\r\nWhen should you see a dermatologist for back acne?\r\n\r\nYou can probably treat mild to moderate back acne at home with over-the-counter options. But if your acne is more severe, meaning you have deep, painful cysts, you should see a dermatologist for help. They may prescribe stronger medications, like prescription retinoids, that can help clear your acne.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not sure if your acne is actually acne, you should also see your dermatologist. There are other skin conditions, including “fungal acne,” that can look a lot like regular acne but that require more specialized treatments.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:25:22', '2021-05-28 19:25:23', '/resources/images/wps11.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/how-to-get-rid-of-back-acne', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (126, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Tan Lines—Without Any More Sun Exposure', 'You don\'t need to risk more sun!', '![img](/resources/images/wps12.png)\r\n\r\nWhen you get home from a long day in the sun, your first instinct might be to figure out how to get rid of those tan lines you accidentally picked up. Of course, you were wearing sunscreen and covering up as much as possible, but even those of us most dedicated to sun safety slip up every once in a while—and pay the price in sun damage and annoying tan lines.\r\n\r\nYou might assume that, to even out your skin tone, you need to get back in the sun or into a tanning bed. But that will only expose you to even more sun damage—and there are plenty of ways to get rid of tan lines without that. In fact, as SELF explained previously, tanning is the direct result of UV exposure to the skin. Over time, that kind of UV exposure can lead to more permanent damage to the skin as well as skin cancer, the CDC says.\r\n\r\nSo, while it’s understandable that you’d want to address the cosmetic concerns of tan lines, it’s important not to use intentional tanning—indoor or outdoor—to do that. Below, check out how to get rid of tan lines with a few safer tips. Not only will your skin tone even out, but your skin might also feel smoother, more moisturized, and more nourished after taking on some of these tips.\r\n\r\n1. Wear sunscreen.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to lighten a tan or even out your skin tone, sunscreen is undoubtedly the most important part of your skin-care arsenal. Wearing sunscreen every day—yes, every single day—will help protect you from UV damage and therefore prevent the parts of your skin that are already tan from continuing to get tan.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nLa Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Milk Sunscreen SPF 100 ($25, Amazon)\r\n\r\nCOOLA Mineral Body Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 ($32, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nBanana Boat Simply Protect Sensitive Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50+ ($8, Target)\r\n\r\n2. Gently exfoliate.\r\n\r\nExfoliating your skin helps remove the outer layer of dead skin cells so that the newer, smoother skin cells underneath are revealed. You can do this with a physical exfoliant, like a scrub, or with a chemical exfoliant, a product containing something like glycolic acid or lactic acid. Over time, this will help your tan to fade, and it’s an important step before using a self-tanner, if that’s something you’re interested in. But be careful not to do this too often because exfoliating with products like these can irritate those with dry or sensitive skin.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nGlytone Exfoliating Body Wash ($32, Amazon)\r\n\r\nPaula’s Choice Weightless Body Treatment 2% BHA ($28, Paula’s Choice)\r\n\r\nShea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Skin Renewal Recipe Body Scrub ($11, Ulta)\r\n\r\n3. Moisturize and use self-tanner.\r\n\r\nAfter exfoliating in the shower, dry off well and load your fave moisturizer onto the already tanned areas to help create a barrier for when you apply the self-tanner. Then dip a makeup sponge into a quality self-tanning gel and blend color evenly into the paler skin; hang tight until it feels dry. You can use a self-tanning cream, but I like gel because it\'s easier to apply on smaller areas of skin. Repeat the exfoliate, lotion, tan routine daily until lines aren\'t noticeable.\r\n\r\nLung Cancer: Myth Vs.

Use body makeup.\r\n\r\nIf you’d prefer to cover your tan lines, try using body makeup. First, take off any clothes near tan lines to avoid staining your clothes and missing major areas. Then dip your index finger into a matte liquid bronzer or body foundation and tap a thin layer over the pale spots. Give it 15 seconds or so to dry, then reassess. If you need to go darker, add another layer. Once you nail your skin tone, gently sweep a bronzing powder over the entire area to help blend the faux with the glow, and finish with a spritz of makeup setting spray.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nDermablend Leg and Body Makeup ($34, Ulta)\r\n\r\nKKW Beauty Skin Perfecting Body Foundation ($45, Ulta)\r\n\r\nDior Backstage Face & Body Foundation ($40, Sephora)\r\n\r\n5. Try body products with vitamin C.\r\n\r\nIf those methods aren’t enough for you, you can also try using body products containing ingredients like vitamin C and niacinamide, which can help lighten hyperpigmentation. These are ingredients commonly used in skin-care products for the face aimed at reducing hyperpigmentation and just overall evening out skin tone. However, they generally take a few weeks to see a noticeable difference.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nM-61 Vitablast C Body Butter ($24, bluemercury)\r\n\r\nOne Love Organics Vitamin C Body Oil ($58, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nAveeno Positively Radiant Body Lotion ($28, Amazon)\r\n\r\n6. Wait it out.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get rid of tan lines is to just wait for them to naturally fade on their own while avoiding sun exposure as much as possible. In fact, your skin cells are constantly in a state of turning over, meaning the newer cells are pushed to the surface as the older skin cells die and flake off. So it’s estimated that, within about 7 to 10 days, your tan will fade significantly—as long as you’re not reexposing the skin to UV light.\r\n\r\nHow to prevent tan lines in the future:\r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent annoying tan lines in the future is to avoid getting a tan at all. That requires wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 anytime you’re exposed to the sun. But it also means trying to stay in the shade as much as possible, wearing clothing that covers your skin (and maybe even contains extra sun protection), and not spending extended time outdoors when the sun is at its strongest.\r\n\r\nTan lines certainly aren’t the most dangerous effect of sun exposure, but they can be annoying—and a sign that you may need to bump up your sun-safety habits.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:25:57', '2021-05-28 19:25:58', '/resources/images/wps12.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/beauty-how-to-fix-tan-lines', 0, 0);

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to keeping breakouts at a minimum, I have a handful of holy-grail skincare go-tos to help appease my finicky, combination skin. As a person who’s tried to do away with zits since the early days of middle school, I have a pretty clear understanding nowadays of the products that will work for me, from the moment they first touch my face. Since one of my long-term skin goals is to have the flexibility to just wear makeup for funsies instead of out of necessity, locking down an effective skincare routine as a foundation is key.\r\n\r\nAs the foundation of any good skincare routine, cleansing is a must, but finding a good cleanser has been the missing piece of my routine for a while. I typically rotate between a few that do the job, but don’t really check off all the boxes for my skin-care needs, which is why I was so surprised by how instantly I took to Space Wash, the new cleanser from buzzy skin-care brand, Starface.\r\n\r\nI’d become a fast fan of buzzy skin-care brand Starface (which was started by former ELLE beauty editor Julie Schott, who, it must be said, has amazing skin) after discovering how effective their cult-favorite Hydro-Stars were. The stars are the brand’s first- and best-sellers, hydrocolloid pimple patches in the shape of—you guessed it—stars, that make even the act of healing zits look cute, and their first-ever cleanser is similarly well-suited for my combination and acne-prone skin.\r\n\r\nSome cleansers have stung my eyes mid-wash, smelled overly perfumed, or left my skin feeling super tight and uncomfortable, but Space Wash is different—this cleanser truly gets me. Formulated with soothing ingredients like sage leaf and calendula flower extract, as well as white willow bark extract to help exfoliate skin, this cleanser has rewarded me with clarity and smoothness every time I use it. It has a barely-there scent with no added fragrance, feels very gentle on my skin, and doesn’t leave behind a sticky residue once it’s rinsed off. Not to mention, it’s comedogenic, dermatologist-tested, oil-free, and vegan.\r\n\r\nAfter rinsing my face, I squirt a nickel-size amount of the cleanser in one palm, add a hint of water, then rub my hands together to form a light, frothy lather. Space Wash is extra silky when I massage it on my face, and once it’s rinsed off, my skin feels clean but not stripped, a common characteristic of other acne-friendly cleansers I’ve used in the past. Not only is its formula absolutely everything for my skin, but the vibrant Space Wash tube (like all Starface products) is one of the best-looking beauty products on my shelf, and also completely recyclable once I’m done with it, which means it’s better for the environment, too.\r\n\r\nI’m so into this cleanser, that at this rate, I’m at a danger of overdoing it on my face washing routine. But if I do get a little heavy handed, I’m lucky that the product is also pretty affordable at $16 a tube and available for auto-refills, which I have to wager that you’ll want to do.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:26:20', '2021-05-28 19:26:21', '/resources/images/wps13.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/starface-space-wash-cleanser-review', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (128, 14, 'This Is Why Your Skin Is All Over the Place Right Now', 'Raise your hand if you’re breaking out!', '![img](/resources/images/wps14.png)\r\n\r\nNow that most of us are spending extra time at home thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, we’ve started to tune in to our skin in a way we didn’t necessarily have time for previously—and some of us aren’t too pleased with what we’re seeing.\r\n\r\nFor some, this time at home has finally allowed us to scale back on all those products, revealing clear skin with—surprise!—a minimalist routine. But others are finding themselves battling breakout after breakout, Carol Cheng, M.D., assistant clinical professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the Acne Procedure Clinic at UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, tells SELF. “I’ve seen it go both ways,” she says, “and I can see a number of reasons why.”\r\n\r\nWhether your skin is getting better these days or…not, here’s what might be behind those changes.\r\n\r\nThere are tons of factors that could be affecting your skin right now—for better or worse.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to remember that some acne triggers aren’t going to change right now, Dr. Cheng says, such as the hormonal influence on skin and acne. But here are a few things that might be making a difference on your skin.\r\n\r\nStress, sleep, diet. People’s skin may respond to things like changes in stress, diet, and sleep in different ways, and we don’t totally understand why, Dr. Cheng says. But if you notice that your skin is behaving badly right now, it makes sense that it might have something to do with these other big changes in your environment and behavior right now.\r\n\r\nUsing fewer skin-care products. “Part of what’s helping people is they are cleaning up their routine,” Mary L. Stevenson, M.D., assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. Not having to go into an office every day is giving us the freedom to cut back on our skin-care regimens and really take the time to be thoughtful about what we’re putting on our face—perhaps we’re even doing it over the course of a morning rather than in 30 seconds before rushing out the door!\r\n\r\nFor some, that minimalism might make them realize they didn’t actually need all those products and that some of them might have even been making their skin break out or irritated. But some of us really do rely on those products to keep our skin calm and clear, Dr. Stevenson says, so taking a break could have a detrimental effect on our skin.\r\n\r\nWorking out at home. If you, like many of us, have gone from working out at your favorite gym or studio class to exclusively working out at home, that could also be having an effect on your skin, Dr. Stevenson says. At home you have time to take off your makeup, you’re not working out in the same room as 25 other sweaty people, and you can clean off all that sweat immediately after you’re done rather than waiting a full subway ride to shower at home. Having that much newfound control over your fitness environment could lead to overall less irritated and less acne-prone skin.\r\n\r\nWearing less makeup. As with skin care, a lot of us are finding that there’s less of a need to wear makeup daily because we’re leaving home so much less often. Personally, outside of the occasional Zoom call, I basically don’t wear any makeup these days, and my skin has been pretty into it. That could be because the products I was wearing are irritating, or it could just be the simple fact of not having an extra layer of stuff on top of my skin helps prevent acne. “The most irritating thing we do is too much,” Dr. Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nSitting in front of screens constantly. Yes, if you are prone to hyperpigmentation, the blue light from your devices might exacerbate that, SELF explained previously. But the bigger risk of sitting idly in front of your laptop, phone, tablet, et cetera for hours on end is that you’re more likely to absent-mindedly pick at or touch your face, Dr. Cheng says, which can contribute to acne and interfere with the skin’s normal healing process.\r\n\r\nWearing face masks. If you’ve been wearing a face mask when in public (which, yes, you should be), you’ve probably noticed how quickly it can get hot and sweaty under there. You may have also noticed that you’re getting acne in the areas of your face that are under the mask. That could be thanks to acne mechanica, Dr. Cheng says, which is caused by something physically trapping that warmth and sweat on your skin.\r\n\r\nTake this opportunity to work on your relationship with your skin.\r\n\r\nOne of the few, tiny silver linings of having this time at home is being able to take the opportunity to more closely monitor your skin and how your products affect it, Dr. Stevenson says. But it’s also important to recognize when you’re paying too much attention to your skin, which can be especially difficult right now if you deal with OCD or a body-focused repetitive disorder that involves skin picking.\r\n\r\nIn general, Dr. Stevenson recommends checking in on your skin at three points during the day: when you wake up, when you get home from work, and before you go to bed. Right now, obviously, many of us don’t get home from work, we just are home and also working. So the blurring of that line can be a little difficult to navigate. It might require you to pick a time when your work day is usually over. Still, try to take those moments—and only those moments—throughout the day to tune in to your skin. And, as SELF explained previously, setting time limits like this is one crucial strategy to managing skin-fueled OCD symptoms.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it’s completely understandable that, with so many changes in our lives, our skin might be going through some changes too. And, for most of us, the changes will be relatively minor and easy to manage with our usual acne- and irritation-fighting strategies. But if your skin changes are causing extra stress or you don’t know what’s causing those changes, it’s worth checking in with a dermatologist about what you can do to deal with them.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:26:40', '2021-05-28 19:26:47', '/resources/images/wps14.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/skin-changes', 0, 0);

It looks like a magical dust that transforms into an even coat of paint. But it\'s completely different from nail polish. A regular manicure can chip immediately after you leave the salon, but most dip-powder manicures claim to last up to three weeks longer than gel manicures. So when my nail tech asked if I wanted to try it out, I was down. But I found out that it isn\'t a new technique at all, dip powder has actually been around since the ‘80s.\r\n\r\nThe name dip powder basically explains the process. First, a base coat is applied, and the nail is dipped into a powder. The process is repeated a couple of times depending on how many coats you want. Then, the rough, powdery layers are transformed into a smooth, glossy finish once a sealant is applied. The best part: You don\'t have to worry about the possibility of skin damage from UV lamps. Unlike the classic gel manicure, it dries instantly. And the powders don\'t pose any inhalation threats, according to chemist Doug Schoon, president of Schoon Scientific + Regulatory Consulting and co-chair of Nail Manufacturer’s Council. That\'s why it\'s being marketed with words like \"safe,\" \"natural,\" and \"organic.\" However those claims aren\'t regulated, and choosing the powders over gel manis isn\'t necessarily a better choice.\r\n\r\nRelated: If You Get Gel Manicures, This Is What You Need To Know About UV Lamps And Skin Cancer\r\n\r\nIn fact, gel manicures, dip powders, and traditional nail extensions have more in common than you think. They are all made up of an acrylic base. \"All of the ingredients used to make any type of artificial nail—whether they be glued, cured by UV, or mixed with a liquid and powder—are based on the acrylic family,\" Schoon says.\r\n\r\nSo, how do dip powders differ from acrylic nails and gel manicures? The grains are finer, which allows them to be created in more vibrant colors. Dip powders are bonded using a glue called cyanoacrylate, which is also the main ingredient in Krazy Glue. \"Acrylic nails\", on the other hand, are applied by combining a liquid with a powder to form a gel. Similarly, the ingredients in gel manicures are like pre-mixed acrylics, and they undergo a chemical reaction once they are cured with a UV lamp.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRelated: What Your Nails Can Tell You About Your Health\r\n\r\nSo, in theory they are all the same. But that doesn\'t mean that they are all bad for your nails. Schoon says that you could wear acrylics for years without harming your nails. You\'ll only see problems if the application, maintenance, or removal techniques are done incorrectly. That\'s why it\'s important to find a salon that doesn\'t rush during the removal process. The dip-powder manicures soak off just like gel manis but can take longer. \"One thing that people don’t understand is that if it says soak for fifteen minutes to remove, that’s the minimum time,\" Schoon says. And the longer you leave the acrylics on, the longer it will take to soak them off. \"It may be fifteen minutes if you take them off the same day, but if you wait two weeks or four weeks, it could take thirty minutes.\" The last thing you want to do is scrape off layers of your nails, so it\'s worth it to be patient. And there is no such thing as gently scraping. \"That\'s like saying I punched you gently in the nose,\" Schoon says.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to reserve dip powder and other acrylic-based manicures for special occasions. \"This may be great as a one time use when you want stronger nails,\" says celebrity nail stylist Elle. The acrylics will create a hard surface on your nails while you\'re wearing them. So, find a technician that won\'t rush through any steps, and one that can talk to you about how to properly take care of your nails in between appointments.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:12:14', '2021-05-28 19:12:17', '/resources/images/wps6.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/dip-powder-nail-polish-manicures', 0, 0);

But, she recently revealed, those manis come at a price. Rushmore-Perrin told the Daily Mail that she’s been getting acrylics for six years. She says she has them done professionally and usually has them removed by professionals, but she recently didn’t have time to visit the salon and decided to DIY. “One nail had come off, and I didn’t want to have nine nails on, so I started peeling and snapping them off,” she said. “I then soaked the remains off in acetone.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that didn’t end well. Rushmore-Perrin posted a photo on Twitter of her torn, cracked, and bleeding nails after she removed her acrylic manicure herself. In another tweet, she said the pain was excruciating. “Nearly cried in the shower at the hot water touching my nail beds and I\'m pretty sure there\'s still loads of shampoo left in my hair,\" she replied to the tweet. “Don’t even care how they look, it’s the physical PAIN dear lord.”\r\n\r\nRushmore-Perrin posted another photo of her much healthier-looking nails less than a week afterward. “Five days later, after taking two different kinds of biotin every day,” she captioned the photo. “Still not amazing or beautiful, but LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, biotin is necessary for the formation of fatty acids and glucose, which fuel the body. Biotin is also a B vitamin that helps provide the necessary building blocks for healthy hair and nail production, Joshua Zeichner, M.D., a New York City-based board-certified dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Rushmore-Perrin\'s case, doctors doubt biotin helped repair her nails. Your nails are only really alive at the base, Doris Day, M.D., a clinical associate professor of dermatology at the New York University Langone Medical Center, tells SELF. By the time nails grow beyond the cuticle, they’re just dead cells, similar to your hair. Therefore, any potential benefits from biotin supplements will be seen from the base on up, which is why Gary Goldenberg, M.D., medical director of the Dermatology Faculty Practice at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells SELF that although biotin is helpful in the development and growth of nails, it can take six to 12 months for people to see results. Day is skeptical Rushmore-Perrin\'s progress is due to the biotin, adding that the beauty blogger\'s nails likely got better because she stopped putting acrylics on and they had time to heal.\r\n\r\nAngelica Ross Gets a Buzz Cut, Talks Womanhood & Radical Blackness\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt\'s usually not necessary to take biotin for hair and nail benefits because it\'s rare for people to be deficient in biotin, Day says. That means people’s bodies typically make healthy hair and nails just fine without additional supplementation. If you do use a supplement, Zeichner says you won’t see any changes to hair and nails you already have. What you can expect, if your body is deficient in biotin, is new hair and nail growth that\'s potentially stronger and healthier than you\'re used to. Jill Waibel, M.D., founder and owner of The Miami Dermatology and Laser in Institute, tells SELF that biotin has been found to be especially helpful with brittle nails, which makes sense since that\'s a common sign of biotin deficiency.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to keep in mind: Supplements are unregulated and can definitely be dangerous or cause unpleasant side effects (many biotin-supplementing people complain of cystic acne online) if you take too many of them. Instead of popping a supplement, Goldenberg points out that it\'s better to get the vitamin from foods such as avocados, fish, and legumes.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re still intrigued, check in with your doctor or dermatologist—they\'ll be able to determine whether you have some sort of deficiency affecting your nails or hair, then be able to figure out an action plan from there.\r\n', 0, '2021-05-28 19:15:20', '2021-05-28 19:15:17', '/resources/images/wps7.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/biotin-nails-acrylics-repair', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (134, 14, 'What Is Dermaplaning and Should You Try It?', 'Here\'s what experts say you should know.', '![img](/resources/images/wps1-1622200668692.png) \r\n\r\nYou may have seen people on YouTube shaving their faces using small razors to exfoliate their skin or get rid of facial hair and wondered, “What is dermaplaning, and should I try it?”\r\n\r\nWhile those YouTube tutorials may make dermaplaning look like an easy “do it yourself” procedure, experts say you should avoid trying this at home for several reasons that we will explain. Plus, dermaplaning is not recommended for all skin types, so it’s best to consult with a dermatologist about whether it’s right for you. Below, dermatologists explain what you should know about dermaplaning, including the risks, benefits, and cost.\r\n\r\n***\\*What is dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nDermaplaning is a cosmetic procedure that involves scraping your face with a scalpel to remove the e pidermis—your top layer of skin—and small hairs, explains Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D., professor of dermatology, medicine, and nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Traditionally, people have the procedure done in a dermatologist’s office, however, you can find blades at the drugstore marketed for at-home dermaplaning use. That said, it’s safer for a professional to perform this. (We’ll get to all of that in a bit.) It’s also always a good idea to research any procedure you’re interested in, even if you delay the actual procedure itself because of the pandemic. (Here’s more information to help you navigate making medical appointments during COVID-19). \r\n\r\nDuring a dermaplaning session, the dermatologist uses a medical-grade scalpel to scrape across the surface of the skin. The treatment takes about 15 minutes, and it can cost anywhere from $40 to more than $150, depending on where you go.\r\n\r\n***\\*What are the benefits of dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nThe main reason people do it is to remove the vellus hairs on their faces, which some people refer to as peach fuzz. Everyone has these fine vellus hairs coating their bodies, and they serve a purpose: Vellus hairs keep us warm and add another layer of protection to the skin. But some people’s vellus hairs are thicker and more visible than others, and depending on how they feel about that, they might want to have it removed. Of course, dermaplaning is just one way to do that. There are many at-home hair removal kits that may get the job done, including the Glee Face Wax Hair Removal Strips for Women ($9, Walmart.com) that a SELF editor loves. However, dermatologist Rosemarie Ingleton, M.D., tells SELF that typical hair-removal methods like waxing and threading don’t always provide the results people are looking for, which makes dermaplaning an appealing option. You may have heard that shaving hair on your face makes hair grow back thicker—that’s technically not true. But it may look thicker or darker, thanks to having a blunter tip from shaving as it grows out, according to the Mayo Clinic.\r\n\r\nPeople might try laser hair removal for longer-lasting results, according to Jeanine Downie, M.D., a dermatologist in New Jersey. This method damages the hair follicles using heat, so your strands don’t grow back as easily. Although it is marketed as a permanent option, your hair may grow back after any hormonal changes (like menopause), according to the Cleveland Clinic. It also takes several sessions to see changes. The exact amount varies, and generally, people with dark skin need more sessions compared to people with light skin. This option also doesn’t work on gray hairs.\r\n\r\nDr. Ingleton says that the biggest reason she does dermaplaning in her practice is to remove vellus hairs, but that the blade also gets rid of a superficial layer of dead skin. This can make your skin look brighter, help your skin-care products sink in better, and make your foundation go on smoother. In Dr. Ingleton’s practice, dermaplaning is often an add-on done before other treatments like microdermabrasion or ablative lasers like Fraxel. When it comes to exfoliating, there are no studies showing how dermaplaning compares to other treatments like retinoids or chemical peels, says Dr. Kim. That’s one reason why Dr. Downie prefers to use peels over dermaplaning—even for sensitive skin—and doesn’t offer dermaplaning in her practice. “Peels help to improve texture, tone, acne, and fine lines,” she says. “They are not equivalent at all, and many peels give deeper exfoliation than a scalpel,” Dr. Downie says.\r\n\r\nIs it ok to try dermaplaning at home?\r\n\r\nWhile it might feel like getting rid of these hairs is easy to do at home with an inexpensive blade, professionals warn against it. Any blade you get over-the-counter won’t be as sharp—or as effective—as the medical-grade scalpel used at the office. Also, there’s always the chance you will cut yourself in the process, potentially causing scarring.\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nAnytime a sharp object goes near your face, there is a risk of damage to the skin. Dr. Downie says that she’s seen patients with scarring after a dermaplaning session gone wrong. Although some medical spas offer dermaplaning, Dr. Downie recommends seeing a professional board-certified dermatologist for this kind of procedure. Board certification is an extra certification step that shows a physician completed advanced training in their specialty. (You can find a board-certified specialist by visiting The American Academy of Dermatology website.)\r\n\r\n***\\*How often should you have dermaplaning done?\\****\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the hair away, you might have to get treated about once a month. (Of course, the exact timeline will look different for each person.) Dr. Kim says this is not a treatment you should do too frequently. Our epidermis helps protect us from allergens and other potential irritants in the outside world—dermaplaning too often may irritate or damage that top layer of protection, she says. Again, this is why it’s best to consult with a physician who can help you decide on the appropriate frequency for your skin and needs.\r\n\r\n***\\*When should you avoid dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nThere are a few instances where you should think twice before signing up for dermaplaning. If you have acne, there is a chance that the blade could nick a pimple, says Dr. Downie, which means it would take longer to heal. So if you have something like a serious cystic breakout happening, it might be best to postpone. Ideally, you want to consult with a doctor who has experience with acne-prone patients. Also, tell your dermatologist if you have a history of cold sores. “If you have a breakout of cold sores, you need to be on Valtrex, and the physician ne eds to avoid the area,” says Dr. Downie. Without the use of a preventive oral anti-herpes medication, the cold sores can spread due to microtears in the skin.\r\n\r\n***\\*Is there anything else to know about dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nAfter a dermaplaning treatment, you do need to take care of your skin. “You have to coat your skin with sunblock afterwards because you’re going to be more sensitive to the sun,” says Dr. Downie. “You also have to be cautious of retinol and glycolic acids.” Dermatologists recommend that people with sensitive skin use a light moisturizer like Vanicream ($36, Amazon) because it doesn’t contain fragrances or other irritants. If you do choose to try dermaplaning, just be sure to work with a professional dermatologist for the safest possible experience.\r\n\r\nAll products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (135, 14, 'How to Manage Retinization When Using Retinoids', 'The first month on retinoids can be brutal.', '![img](/resources/images/wps2.png)\r\n\r\nBeauty editors praise retinoids for being a skin-care ingredient that seemingly does it all. They’re powerful enough to decrease acne, pigmentation, and wrinkles. But first comes the retinization period, where you might experience reddened, peeling, and dry skin. During this time, your skin is adjusting to the medication, and let’s not mince words, it sucks.\r\n\r\nIf you previously tried retinoids but thought they weren’t for you because of the side effects, then we have some good news: You can try again if you want. “Almost everyone can use retinoids if you tailor it to yourself,” Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D, professor of Dermatology, Medicine, and Nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, tells SELF. The key is figuring out the right strength and how often you can use it, she says. Even most of her patients with rosacea or sensitive skin can generally use a mild retinoid sparingly, she explains.\r\n\r\nWe spoke to a few experts about what you should know about retinoids and tips to keep in mind.\r\n\r\n1. What are retinoids, and why should you use them?\r\n\r\nThere’s a good chance you’ve heard of “retinols,” and you might be wondering if they are different from retinoids. It’s easiest to think of retinoids as a family of compounds derived from vitamin A, explains Dr. Kim. Then, there are retinols, or a form of retinoids commonly found in over-the-counter skin care products, and retinoic acid, found in prescription medications. But again, these are all forms of vitamin A, which can help your skin cells turn over more quickly when applied topically.\r\n\r\n“It’s very confusing because people just call everything retinols, but there are differences,” says Dr. Kim. The most important thing for you to remember is that retinoic acid requires a prescription and retinols can be found in products at your drugstore. Retin-A, or tretinoin as it’s called generically, is one popular brand of prescription retinoic acid.\r\n\r\nRetinoids may reduce wrinkles because they activate your skin’s natural collagen and elastin (two fibers that keep it strong). They’re also good exfoliators since they force your skin cells to turn over more quickly, which helps reduce acne, says Dr. Kim. In six to eight weeks, retinoids can clear up and prevent acne, reduce the look of fine lines, and lighten hyperpigmentation until it disappears. But prescription retinoids are strong stuff, so your skin is likely to get sensitive and irritated as it gets used to their mechanisms of action. Over-the-counter retinols can cause light irritation, but it\'s less severe since they are formulated to be gentler than prescription options. Because retinols are weaker, you may not notice skin changes, e.g., less acne, for several months, Dr. Kim says.\r\n\r\n2. What is retinization?\r\n\r\nLike we said, retinization is that period where your skin is adjusting to the retinoids. Generally, your skin may feel irritated, dry, and begin peeling, explains Dr. Kim. It starts a few days after you first start applying the medication and can last about a month (give or take a couple weeks) while your skin builds up a tolerance. Even people with sensitive skin can generally use some form of retinoids, says Dr. Kim. However, they might need to try the following skin care strategies to help reduce irritation, especially if using a prescription retinoid. Or, people with sensitive skin may need to try over-the-counter retinols since these are less irritating. Dr. Kim likes Differin Gel ($16, Amazon.com) since it was previously available by prescription and has been well-tested. As with most health concerns, it is best to consult with a dermatologist who can help you develop a plan that works for your specific skin. Right now, many physicians are offering virtual appointments using video chat. (Here’s what you need to know about scheduling medical appointments during COVID-19).\r\n\r\n3. Prepare your skin before starting retinoids.\r\n\r\nThe best prep you can do for your new retinoid regimen is to make sure your face isn’t dehydrated. “Moisturized skin has a better barrier function,” meaning that it’s at peak protection for whatever you throw at it, Beverly Hills dermatologist and founder of SkinxFive Ava Shamban, M.D., tells SELF. She says that means starting on a solid moisturization routine—morning and night—at least a week or so before you begin using the medication.\r\n\r\n4. Apply moisturizer before your retinoid at night.\r\n\r\nLayering the retinoid over a gentle moisturizer will help temper any irritation. Look for a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, ceramides, antioxidants, or redness-relieving peptides. Finding the right moisturizer for your particular skin type isn’t always easy. You can read our guide on moisturizer if you need help finding a product you like. The CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Lotion ($18, Amazon.com) is one dermatologist-recommended pick that works well for combination skin, for instance.\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nNote: The skin around your eyes is extra sensitive, and you shouldn’t apply retinoids to the upper eyelids at the risk of getting product in your eye. Protect the entire eye area with a thick moisturizer before putting retinoids on the rest of your face.\r\n\r\n5. Don’t start by applying retinoids every day.\r\n\r\nRetinoids aren’t something you should apply every day from the start. You have to work your way up to regular use. “Start slowly applying twice per week and then gradually add another day until you have built up tolerance for daily use,” RealSelf dermatologist Michele Green, M.D., tells SELF. If your skin has an adverse reaction, such as excessive peeling, lay off the treatment for a couple days. Then, you can try again but decrease the amount of times you use it per week. For example, if you experienced irritation after using it four times in a week, then bump your frequency down to three and see how your skin reacts. Some people can only tolerate using retinoids about twice a week, explains Dr. Kim.\r\n\r\n6. Change to a simple skin-care routine.\r\n\r\nFor the first month of regular retinoid use, your skin is officially classified as “sensitive.” That means you need to change up your cleansing and exfoliating routine. “Using a gentle detergent cleanser will allow some natural oils to remain on the skin, reducing the likelihood of developing the irritant dermatitis,” says Dr. Shamban. She says to look for something that is cream-based like Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser ($10, Amazon.com).\r\n\r\nAlso give up your masks, peels, and exfoliating scrubs. “Retinol will naturally exfoliate the skin,” says Dr. Shamban. “There is no reason to do any kind of a manual dermabrasion or exfoliating.” Dr. Green adds that you should avoid applying any other skin-care products with retinol, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and glycolic acid as they can be too harsh on your skin during retinization.\r\n\r\n7. Treat dry patches with extra moisturizer.\r\n\r\nDry patches and peeling will likely happen when you use retinoids. Dr. Shamban recommends applying aloe gel or 1 percent hydrocortisone cream like CeraVe Anti-Itch Cream ($9, Amazon.com) during the day to help with flakiness and irritation.\r\n\r\n8. Be patient about your results.\r\n\r\n“In dermatology, people want to do something once and that’s it,” says Dr. Kim. However, she says that you need to be patient and play the long game when it comes to retinoids. “You want to use this for a long time to really see the benefit of what these can do for your skin,” she says. So if a prescription retinoid is irritating, then you may want to use a weaker retinol. Or your doctor may be able to prescribe you a lower-dose retinoid that your skin tolerates.\r\n\r\n9. Call your dermatologist if you’re in pain.\r\n\r\nYes, some redness and itchiness are expected, but if you have an extreme reaction, it needs professional attention. “If your face starts to look like a charred tomato, it’s time to back off and see a physician,” Dr. Shamban says. Dr. Green seconds this sentiment, “If the skin starts to crack and you have open lesions which are oozing, you should definitely stop using the product and see your dermatologist. Also, if you develop a rash, this could mean you are having an allergic reaction to the product.” Again, you may not feel comfortable with physical office visits right now. But your dermatologist may be able to provide care through a virtual session, so it’s worth calling their office to check.\r\n\r\nAdditional reporting by Melissa Matthews\r\n\r\nAll products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (136, 14, '10 Things to Know Before Trying Dermal Fillers', 'Read this before making your appointment.', '![img](/resources/images/wps3.png) \r\n\r\nOur bodies naturally change with age, and those differences might include new wrinkles on our faces or cheekbones that aren’t as high as they once were. Dermal fillers can help minimize these signs of aging if you’re unhappy with them.\r\n\r\nHowever, these changes are completely normal and occur when we lose some of the subcutaneous fat that supports our skin. Over time, the skin on the middle of our faces shifts down too, causing our cheeks to sag a bit, explains Mary Stevenson, M.D., dermatologist at NYU Langone Health. “Filler can be used to help lift and add support,” she tells SELF. It can also help soften wrinkles, Dr. Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nThere are several categories of dermal fillers, and they’re all generally administered in the same way (more on that in a bit). Before electing to have any type of cosmetic or medical procedure, it’s important to understand what the process entails and any potential risks. Understandably, you might also have concerns about visiting a doctor’s office during the pandemic. Our story about making medical appointments during COVID-19 can help you decide if now is the right time to schedule an elective procedure. But below, you’ll find information experts think you should know about dermal fillers\r\n\r\n1. What exactly are dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nFirst things first: Dermal fillers are not to be confused with Botox, injectable drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to smooth lines and wrinkles. The latter \"freezes\" muscles to reduce wrinkles, while dermal fillers are injectable implants approved by the FDA to help smooth skin and wrinkles. As the name implies, they are injected beneath your skin using a needle.\r\n\r\nAccording to the FDA, there are four categories of fillers. Each is named for the type of material they’re made with:\r\n\r\nHyaluronic acid is naturally produced by your body and already found in your skin and cartilage. Generally, fillers made with hyaluronic acid last between 6-12 months.\r\n\r\nCalcium hydroxylapatite is a mineral that is found in our bones. Fillers made with this material last up to 18 months.\r\n\r\nPoly-L-lactic acid is a biodegradable synthetic material that’s also used to make medical products like dissolvable stitches. These fillers may last up to two years.\r\n\r\nPolymethylmethacrylate beads are the only filler that can’t be absorbed by your body, meaning the results are permanent. They’re only used around the mouth.\r\n\r\nHyaluronic acid, which you may recognize as a common ingredient in some skincare products, is one of the most popular types of fillers, explains Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D, professor of dermatology, medicine, and nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Because it helps skin retain moisture, hyaluronic acid can make your face look more plump and hydrated. It\'s also used in lotions as a moisturizer, but no cream can restore lost volume—only injectable hyaluronic acid can do that. Juvéderm and Restylane are two popular name brand hyaluronic fillers that you may have heard of.\r\n\r\n2. How do I know which dermal filler to try?\r\n\r\nA good doctor will explain the ideal treatment plan for you, but know that the most natural-looking results may require more than one type of filler. There are many different brands of fillers within each category, and the products vary in how they should be used—like filling out cheeks—and concentration of the active ingredient, explains Dr. Kim. For example, Restylane, one brand of hyaluronic filler, has five different lines—and each is used for different reasons. \"Restylane Lyft has larger particle sizes—think of them like the bricks of a foundation,\" Whitney Bowe, M.D. a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, tells SELF. Those larger particles have the heft to \"rebuild\" thinned cheekbones, while a smaller particle size, as in Restylane Silk, works better for addressing fine lines and plumping lips.\r\n\r\n3. Why do people get dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nDr. Kim explains that patients come to her saying “they just want to look a little better,” without turning to cosmetic surgery. She uses dermal fillers to add in volume and smooth out wrinkles, which her patients are normally happy with, she says.\r\n\r\nWATCH\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nDermal fillers are particularly popular because patients see differences in their appearances before leaving her office, Dr. Kim says. Generally, people notice the desired changes from other non-surgical procedures, like Botox, after a few days.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note: Dermal fillers are not FDA-approved for body contouring procedures. In other words, they shouldn’t be used to increase the size of your breasts or butt.\r\n\r\n4. What precautions should I take before getting fillers?\r\n\r\nIt probably goes without saying, but safety should be your top priority when considering any medical procedure. Dr. Kim says visiting a board-certified dermatologist or a board-certified plastic surgeon is one way to ensure that your physician is experienced. This extra certification step shows that the doctor completed additional training in their particular specialty. (You can find a board-certified specialist by visiting The American Board of Plastic Surgery or the American Academy of Dermatology websites.) Even though dermal fillers are available at medical spas, you should see only licensed and trained physicians for any injectable treatment. There are risks for issues like infection, discoloration, and lumps if injections are done incorrectly.\r\n\r\nGiven that this is a cosmetic procedure, you understandably want to be satisfied with the results. One way to find a doctor whose work you like is by asking friends who have had this done for their recommendations. \"People are starting to be more open about injectables,\" Ava Shamban, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist in Los Angeles, tells SELF.\r\n\r\n5. What should I ask my doctor during the consultation?\r\n\r\n“I think as a patient you should always ask for a consultation first and then really talk about what your goal is and how they [the doctor] can help you,” says Dr. Kim. You may think you just want dermal fillers, but an expert could recommend another treatment—or a combination of treatments—based on your specific skin type and goals. For example, your doctor may suggest using laser therapy if you have a lot of pigmentation, she says.\r\n\r\nDr. Shamban advises requesting before-and-after photographs of real patients from the doctor’s office. Every practitioner has different philosophies, techniques, and levels of experience. And don\'t be afraid to ask about your doctor’s training and certification during the initial consultation.\r\n\r\nLastly, you and your physician should communicate about realistic results and your expectations—it\'s your face, after all.\r\n\r\n6. What are the possible side effects of fillers?\r\n\r\nEven non-surgical procedures have their risks. The most common side effects include bruising, redness, pain, or swelling, all of which should go away within two weeks, according to the FDA. Less frequently, people might get raised bumps under their skin that need to be treated with injections, medications, or even surgically removed, according to the FDA.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is rare, filler can accidentally be injected into a blood vessel and lead to blurred vision or permanent blindness. You should call your doctor or the emergency room if your skin turns blue and you’re in a lot of pain—these are two possible signs that filler is in your bloodstream. Again, this is why you want to see an experienced doctor who is skilled in performing the procedure.\r\n\r\n7. Who should avoid dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nAccording to the FDA, there’s no research showing that dermal fillers are safe for pregnant or breastfeeding people, so you may want to hold off if you’re expecting a baby or recently had a child. And here\'s one more thing to consider: Avoid getting filler right before a teeth cleaning or other dental treatment, Dr. Shamban says. These procedures require pressure and stretching of the face that could potentially misplace fillers. You can ask your doctor for their opinion regarding when it’s safe to get any future dental work during your consultation.\r\n\r\n8. How much do dermal fillers cost?\r\n\r\nIf the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. If you see a deal for inexpensive filler, be skeptical. \"You have to be careful,\" Dr. Shamban says, adding that counterfeit and diluted filler do exist. \"Ask to see the box, and look for a safety seal on it.\" The price of these fillers varies depending on the amount of product needed. In 2019, the average cost of hyaluronic acid fillers was $652 per syringe, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. They estimate that most patients need more than one syringe to achieve the results they’re looking for.\r\n\r\n9. Are dermal fillers permanent?\r\n\r\nIf you\'re unhappy with the way filler looks, don\'t panic—in most cases, you can have it adjusted. A dermatologist might inject additional filler for balance, or they can dissolve it altogether, depending on the type. \"The wonderful thing about hyaluronic acid fillers is that there\'s an enzyme that can be injected into the area to dissolve the product,\" Dr. Shamban says. \"It just goes away.\"\r\n\r\nBut when expertly injected, filler should look natural. \"The changes we can make are so subtle that nobody would notice,\" says Dr. Shamban. \r\n\r\n10. How long will the results last?\r\n\r\nSince the majority of fillers aren’t permanent, you\'ll have to keep going back to the doctor’s office if you love the results following your procedure. After about six months, your body naturally breaks down hyaluronic acid fillers. So, you have to get touch-ups once or twice a year to maintain the look. However, this is good news if you just want to try fillers once or twice, since the effects will fade away without any long-term risks.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:19:50', '2021-05-28 19:19:51', '/resources/images/wps3.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/dermal-fillers', 0, 0);

Whether it’s 100 degrees and humid or pouring rain, I make sure that my face is saturated with a healthy dollop of sun protection before leaving the house. I thought I’d discovered all my skin-care favorites—until I tried Supergoop! Play Everyday Lotion’s updated reef-safe sunscreen formula. \r\n\r\nI already count Supergoop!’s Unseen Sunscreen among my product ride-or-dies, but after emptying my last tube this summer, I decided to venture out of my comfort zone and test Supergoop! Play, which is suitable for both face and body. Typically I’m wary of two-in-one skin products (I don’t fully endorse the idea of body wash that also works for your face, for example). But I was willing to give this a shot because I love Supergoop!—and it didn’t disappoint.\r\n\r\nI totally get why this is called Everyday Lotion, since its consistency is just as creamy and lightweight as some of my favorite moisturizers. Although it goes on white, the sunscreen has an invisible finish once rubbed in, unlike a lot of lotions that leave a chalky cast. It’s nongreasy with a pleasantly mild scent, and my skin drinks this stuff up with little effort. Supergoop! Play\'s chameleon-like ability to work on both my face and body without triggering breakouts is truly a game changer, and I no longer have to bother switching between a bunch of sun-protection products on the regular. \r\n\r\nSince Supergoop! Play offers broad-spectrum SPF 50 protection, plus has a water- and sweat-resistant formula, I don’t worry about it wearing off during outdoor workouts. I can happily wear it in the ocean and actually feel good about it, as it is now officially a reef-safe sunscreen, meaning it doesn’t contain chemical UV filters like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are known to be harmful to coral reefs and other sea life. \r\n\r\nNow that I’ve added this new gold star to my list of skin-care go-tos, I’m ready to graduate from the handheld 2.4-ounce size right to the jumbo, easy-to-pump 18-ounce version.

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (138, 14, 'Watch Shay Mitchell Get Her First Treatment for Post-Pregnancy Melasma ', 'A week later, she\'s already seeing results.', '![img](/resources/images/wps6.png) \r\n\r\nShay Mitchell, who gave birth to her daughter this past October, recently walked her Instagram followers through her first intense pulsed light therapy (IPL) treatment session. She sought out the treatment to help manage her melasma, a skin condition often associated with pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIn the IGTV post, Mitchell starts with a mirror selfie showing off her comfy outfit (and mask!). She announces that this is her first melasma treatment and offers some background information about melasma and IPL treatments. Then, after a quick shot of her face with numbing cream, Mitchell takes a moment to show the camera her “little melasma spot” just below her eye and points to a patch of melasma on her upper lip. “Especially for new moms,” she says. “We go out in the sun and this is what happens.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Mitchell says she was too nervous to take video during the actual treatment, immediately after it she reports that her face is numb and that the IPL felt like “a million little elastic bands hitting all over.” She also points out a few red areas on her face that the treatment had targeted. Her facial treatment continues with a soothing collagen mask.\r\n\r\nThen, Mitchell cuts to an update from a week after her first treatment. She seems happy with the results so far. Although she says it’s recommended to get another one or two treatments, after the first one she feels that “we’re on track to lightening these little guys up.”\r\n\r\nMelasma is a form of hyperpigmentation that frequently shows up during or after pregnancy. The condition is so frequently associated with pregnancy that it’s sometimes even called the mask of pregnancy, SELF explained previously. It usually causes patches of brown or grayish-brown skin on the cheeks, forehead, nose, upper lip, and chin. Those patches aren’t harmful or painful, and sometimes, they’ll fade away on their own. But some people may want to have them lightened or removed.\r\n\r\nFirst off, as Mitchell points out, melasma is exacerbated by UV exposure, so wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 is usually a mainstay of melasma treatment and maintenance. Plus, recent research suggests that those with melasma may benefit from using a sunscreen containing iron oxides, which help block visible light from the sun and devices, like your phone or laptop.\r\n\r\nFrom there, treatment usually involves topical medications, such as prescription hydroquinone, which can lighten skin, the American Academy of Dermatology explains. Tretinoin, a powerful retinoid that speeds up the cell turnover process, is another common choice, as are corticosteroid medications and azelaic acid. \r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nBut topical medications aren’t always enough, which is where treatments like the one Mitchell received come in. For more stubborn melasma, a dermatologist might recommend in-office procedures like microdermabrasion, chemical peels, or laser treatments. The specific treatment Mitchell got—IPL—is similar to laser treatments but involves the use of multiple light wavelengths to treat certain issues. It’s especially useful in managing hyperpigmentation, broken blood vessels sometimes seen in rosacea, and age spots.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that nonablative treatments like this stimulate the growth of new collagen by heating up the skin, SELF explained previously. However, for most skin conditions, multiple treatments are required for you to see noticeable results. Mitchell specifically mentions in her video that she’s hoping her melasma spots will look lighter after three sessions.\r\n\r\nAfter treatment, it’s normal for the skin to be a little red, swollen, and sensitive for a few hours or a few days, Baylor College of Medicine explains.

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (139, 14, 'Here’s Why You Get Sun Spots on Your Face—And How to Treat Them', 'They’re usually harmless.', '![img](/resources/images/wps8.png) \r\n\r\nIf you’ve spent any time in the sun throughout your life, you may have developed some sun spots on your face. These spots (also called age spots, liver spots, or solar lentigines) appear as flat, smooth brown spots on areas of your skin that tend to get a lot of sun exposure.\r\n\r\nSun spots are generally harmless areas of pigmented skin, but they can be easily confused with other types of sun-related spots on the skin, including some that may actually be a sign of skin cancer. If you think you have sun spots on your face, it’s important to monitor them and to get anything that looks iffy checked out by a board-certified dermatologist.\r\n\r\nHere’s what you need to know about sun spots, how to prevent them, how dermatologists can treat or remove them, and signs to look for that may signal an issue.\r\n\r\nWhat causes sun spots on your face?\r\n\r\nSun spots on your face are a type of hyperpigmentation caused by UV exposure. Essentially, after being exposed to the sun, your skin increases production of melanin, the pigment that gives skin color. Over time, some areas of your skin may develop clumps of melanin or may overproduce that pigment, resulting in a sun spot, the Mayo Clinic explains.\r\n\r\nThese types of spots tend to show up on areas of your body where you get the most sun, which might include your face, shoulders, hands, chest, and the back of your hands, Mary L. Stevenson, M.D., assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. Sun spots tend to be flat rather than raised, are usually brown, and may appear in clusters.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to prevent sun spots?\r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent sun spots on your face is to develop and maintain solid sun safety habits. “They can be prevented with diligent sun protection including use of sunscreen on regular basis, and other forms of sun protection like hats, sun glasses, and clothing,” Nada Elbuluk, M.D., clinical assistant professor of dermatology (clinician educator), Keck School of Medicine of USC, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nThat includes using broad spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) every day, particularly on areas of your body that are prone to sun exposure, like your face, your shoulders, and the back of your hands. Sun spots are more likely to show up on people with lighter skin, Elbuluk says, but people with darker skin tones can still develop sun-related skin damage, so it’s important for everyone to wear sunscreen regularly.\r\n\r\nBut we know that it’s a bit difficult to stick to diligent sunscreen wearing (and reapplication) habits—and even perfect sunscreen usage doesn’t protect you from 100% of the sun’s rays. That’s why it’s crucial to also use other sun protection strategies, like wearing sun-protective clothing, sticking to the shade whenever possible, and wearing hats and sunglasses that block the sun.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nEltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 ($38, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nNeutrogena Ultra-Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreen SPF 30 ($10, Amazon)\r\n\r\nLa Roche Posay Anthelios Mineral Sunscreen Gentle Lotion SPF 50 ($22, Amazon)\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to treat sun spots?\r\n\r\nTrue sun spots are not harmful and don\'t need to be treated. If you do decide you want to have your sun spots treated or removed for cosmetic reasons, this is something you’ll likely have to see a professional about. Although you can certainly try some products containing the classic brightening ingredients, like hydroquinone, retinoids, or vitamin C, “over-the-counter products are typically not strong enough to have a significant effect on sun spots,” Elbuluk explains.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nAlthough some of those products can be helpful in preventing sun spots and generally evening out your skin tone, they aren’t likely to be enough once you have the spots, Stevenson says. So if you want to have a sun spot removed, you’ll need to talk to a board-certified dermatologist. They may recommend using a prescription-strength lightening cream or procedures such as professional chemical peels or laser treatments, Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nAfter a laser treatment, the spot will usually “turn a little white, crust, and then peel off,” Stevenson explains, so that you’re left with a subtly pink area that eventually fades. After doing all that work to have the spot removed, it’s really important to keep it from getting any more sun, she says, especially while it’s still healing, because laser treatments can make your skin more sensitive to sun exposure. In fact, Stevenson says she generally doesn’t treat sun spots during the summer because of this risk for more pigmentation after treatment. \r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes other types of spots (called seborrheic keratoses) are confused with sun spots, Stevenson says. Seborrheic keratoses, like sun spots, are harmless brown, tan, or black growths on the skin, the Mayo Clinic explains. However, unlike true sun spots, these marks tend to be slightly raised, which means they may need to be shaved down or destroyed with electrocautery. These procedures may then be combined with laser treatments to further remove the pigment. Many people who are prone to sun spots are also prone to seborrheic keratoses, so it’s common to have both Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nHyperpigmentation on the face might also be melasma, a condition that tends to appear in patches on the cheeks, forehead, nose, or chin, SELF explained previously.\r\n\r\nWhen should you talk to a dermatologist?\r\n\r\nAlthough true sun spots aren’t harmful, they are a result of sun damage and therefore can be a sign that you need to get better at protecting yourself from sun exposure.\r\n\r\nSometimes, cancerous spots on your skin can look like sun spots or seborrheic keratoses, the Mayo Clinic says. So if you have a lot of sun spots or you notice one that looks suspicious or odd, it’s always a good idea to get checked out by a dermatologist. \r\n\r\nIn particular, it’s important to take note of any spots that seem to be growing or changing rapidly. “If [you have] a brown spot that seems to be changing in size, color, or appearance, then it may not be a sun spot and should be examined by a board-certified dermatologist to rule out skin cancer,” Elbuluk says.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:20:57', '2021-05-28 19:20:59', '/resources/images/wps8.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/sun-spots-on-face', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (140, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Spider Veins and Varicose Veins', 'This isn’t a DIY situation.', '![img](/resources/images/wps9.png)\r\n\r\nIf you’re wondering how to get rid of spider veins, you’ve probably already come across a bunch of the internet’s suggestions. When I noticed a series of faint blue lines twisting around my thigh, some of the recommended home remedies I saw included ginger tea, massage, and even exercise. But here’s the honest truth: That’s all B.S. Visible veins aren’t something you can fix at home.\r\n\r\nSo I talked to dermatologists and surgeons who specialize in treating spider veins and varicose veins (the larger, raised visible veins that often appear on the legs). What I learned is that the underlying causes of these visible veins aren’t always preventable—and they can be a sign of a much deeper vein problem that no home remedy is likely to fix. Here’s how to get rid of spider veins for real—and why it’s so important to see a specialist to do so.\r\n\r\nWhat actually are spider veins?\r\n\r\nThere are two common types of visible veins: spider veins and varicose veins. “Spider veins are really small superficial veins that are in the outer layer of skin between the dermis and epidermis, so you can see them,” Christopher Hollingsworth, M.D., a general surgeon at NYC Surgical Associates, tells SELF. “If you live long enough, most people are going to get them.” These veins get their name because they look like thin, weblike, blue-and-purple lines on the legs.\r\n\r\nVaricose veins, on the other hand, are larger veins that are deeper in the body. “You won’t see them as a discoloration, you’ll see them when they get so stretched out that they kind of bulge,” Dr. Hollingsworth says.\r\n\r\nBecause these two issues are caused by similar blood-flow situations, varicose and spider veins commonly occur together. That means that people who have varicose veins almost always have spider veins too. However, some people get spider veins and never have a problem with varicose veins.\r\n\r\nWhat causes spider veins and other visible veins?\r\n\r\nTo understand why these visible veins develop, you’ve got to understand how blood flows through the body. Your heart pumps blood to your entire body through your blood vessels. From there, blood circulates outward toward the extremities (legs, arms, head) through the arteries and back inward to the heart through your veins.\r\n\r\n“Think of veins as being a hose that flows from bottom-up toward your heart,” says dermatologist Alicia Barba, M.D., of Barba Dermatology. “And there’s a little valve. When they work well, the blood shoots up and the valve closes. When it doesn’t work, the blood falls back down instead of moving north.”\r\n\r\nWhen blood flows in the wrong direction because of a valve problem, it can get backed up in the veins of the legs, which damages the walls of the vein, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) explains. That extra pressure on the vein walls gradually causes them to weaken and then bulge, creating veins we can actually see. In fact, the majority of people who have spider veins and/or varicose veins will be dealing with this type of “venous insufficiency,” Dr. Hollingsworth says.\r\n\r\nHowever, other factors can contribute to the likelihood that you’ll develop visible veins, including genetics, age, and your level of physical activity, the AAD says.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you have a job where you are standing still for long periods of time, gravity is at work pulling the blood back down toward the legs, causing the veins to get stretched out and the valves to weaken over time. If you sit all day at your job, you can also start to see visible veins because there is a lack of muscle movement. The muscles in the leg help the veins push the blood back up toward the heart, so moving around during the day can help prevent visible veins. (That rumor that crossing your legs can cause spider veins isn’t true, so go ahead and cross ’em if you like—just make sure that you get out of your chair and move around during the day to get the blood pumping.)\r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nThere is some research to suggest that carrying extra weight can impact the function of your veins and, therefore, also increase your risk for visible veins. Having more fat around your stomach (visceral fat) can increase the pressure in your abdomen, Dr. Hollingsworth says, which then creates an obstruction that blocks the flow of blood. “That increased pressure dilates the veins, which extends all the way through the lower vein bridge and all the way up to the veins in your skin,” he explains.\r\n\r\nA similar situation happens during pregnancy when the added pressure in the abdomen squeezes the veins. But the hormonal shifts that happen during pregnancy may also play a role. “When women are exposed to excess estrogen or progesterone, what it tends to do is make your soft tissue a little more flexible,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. “That same process, we think, is affecting the veins, making them predisposed to dilate and stretch out.” After pregnancy, the veins generally go away and everything returns to normal. This vein weakening can also happen if you’re taking hormonal birth control.\r\n\r\nAlthough visible veins may seem like a purely superficial issue, they can become painful when left untreated. “Spider and varicose veins make your legs sore because it’s an inflammatory process,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. “Those veins are getting dilated and stretched out. They’re trying to signal for help in the only way they know how, which is sending off a local inflammatory biochemical that causes your legs to swell and to be sore.” So preventing and treating spider veins can save you from a lot of discomfort.\r\n\r\nCan you do anything to prevent spider veins?\r\n\r\nThere are a few different underlying causes of vein issues that are preventable or reversible, while others aren\'t. For instance, if your visible veins are largely due to inherited factors, pregnancy, or how active you can be during the work day, that’s not likely something you have a ton of control over.\r\n\r\nBut there are some general things you can do to prevent them, such as maintaining physical activity during the day. If you sit at work all day, the AAD recommends getting up and walking around a bit every 30 minutes. Or, if you stand at work for long periods of time, the AAD recommends taking a break and sitting down every 30 minutes. And exercising in general, elevating your legs when possible, and avoiding soaking for long periods of time in hot baths can help prevent visible veins as well, the AAD says.\r\n\r\nHowever, these strategies can’t treat any visible veins you already have.\r\n\r\nYou’ll need to see a specialist to actually treat visible veins.\r\n\r\nIf you’re wondering how to get rid of spider veins for good, know that Dr. Hollingsworth says those wacky home remedies won’t work. Dry brushing? Nope. Fancy body lotions? Nah. Massage? It might feel good, but there won’t be a visible difference.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing really that you can do aside from the small minimally invasive treatments we have that is going to make spider veins look any better,” he says. “Creams, ointments, or rubbing aren’t going to make spider veins go away.”\r\n\r\nThe primary way that spider and varicose veins are treated is by using different surgical methods to close off the vein so that it collapses and the residual scar tissue stops the blood flow completely. These are all superficial veins, so other healthy veins just take over their circulation duties and the procedure won’t impact your overall health. Also, those with more serious, bulging varicose veins can have them removed completely once the vein is closed off.\r\n\r\nSclerotherapy: This is one of the more popular options for spider veins and varicose veins. A doctor injects a foamy detergent or concentrated saltwater solution into the problematic vein, which irritates the walls of the blood vessel, explains Neil Sadick, M.D., founder of Sadick Dermatology. This causes scar tissue to form, which leads the blood vessel to close. If someone is allergic to the sclerotherapy solution, there are other treatment options.\r\n\r\nLaser treatment: A vein surgeon or dermatologist might use a laser treatment to heat the vein, causing it to contract and scar over. Dr Hollingsworth uses a handheld Nd:YAG laser (the same machine that can be used in laser hair removal) on small spider veins. Or, if it’s a larger varicose vein, a laser may be inserted into the vein using a catheter to stop blood flow.\r\n\r\nMedical glue: For varicose veins, doctors might also use is the medical version of superglue. “Cyanoacrylate glue is a biologic glue that’s very similar to Krazy Glue,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. Surgeons close off a varicose vein by gluing it shut from the inside. “You inject it, wait for the glue to set, and move further down, and so on and so on.”\r\n\r\nRadio frequency ablation (RFA): This is another option for varicose veins that are so large that glue and sclero just float away. “RFA runs radio frequency through the inside of the vein and turns the inside of the vein into a lightbulb filament, heats it up, scars it, and kills it,” says Dr. Hollingsworth.\r\n\r\nTo prevent visible veins from getting worse, a surgeon might use RFA or internal laser techniques to close off a larger vein deeper in the leg that feeds the smaller varicose veins and spider veins. “There’s a central pipe in the leg called the saphenous vein; it’s the main superficial vein. Coming off those veins are truncal varicose veins,” Dr. Sadick says. Once the larger vein is taken care of, the smaller veins can be treated with sclerotherapy, glue, or a handheld laser.\r\n\r\nAll of these treatments are performed through tiny punctures in the skin, so you can likely schedule your procedure in the morning and go back to work in the afternoon. However, Dr. Barba warns about getting these treatments on darker skin tones, especially laser and RFA procedures, because those with darker skin tones have a higher risk for hyperpigmentation issues following the treatments. Plus, those pigmentation issues can be stubborn to treat. “Sometimes the pigmentation is a part of the healing process,” Dr. Barba says. “If you care about a little spider vein, you might care about the pigment that’s going to be there for a couple months.”\r\n\r\nWhatever treatment you go with, the key is to go to a doctor who specializes in vein treatments, whether that’s a dermatologist or a vein surgeon. “If you want have anything done, go to whoever does a lot of it,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. The good news is that insurance will cover many vein treatments. Without insurance, these treatments can cost $300 to $8,000. “Oftentimes, when it is a deeper vein problem, insurance covers it because it\'s not [just] a cosmetic issue,” Dr. Barba says.\r\n\r\nHow can you prevent spider veins from coming back?\r\n\r\nAlthough effective, all of these surgical treatments are really temporary fixes, Dr. Hollingsworth says. Spider and varicose veins can return in other nearby veins once the original veins are closed off or removed. So, if you decide not to treat them at all, they can multiply, Dr. Hollingsworth says. But if you stay on top of them—which will require repeated treatments every one to two years—you can keep them at bay.\r\n\r\nAfter treatment, one thing you can do to effectively prevent spider veins from returning is to wear compression stockings daily, which can be difficult to get on and uncomfortable to wear. \"Nobody likes wearing them,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. But, “if you wear stockings religiously during the day, they significantly reduce [the chance that] your spider veins [will come] back.” In some cases, your health insurance may actually cover the cost of medical-grade compression stockings, Medline Plus explains, so check with them before buying any.\r\n\r\nUltimately, if you’re dealing with spider veins or varicose veins, it’s important to check in with a doctor or dermatologist. They can help you understand how serious your particular issue is, talk about what may underlying issues may have caused it, and, if necessary, walk you through your treatment options.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:21:21', '2021-05-28 19:21:23', '/resources/images/wps9.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/spider-and-varicose-veins', 0, 0);

You’re probably not imagining it. Not only is it becoming offensively hot and humid this summer, but we’re also wearing masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19—both of which may contribute to acne and other skin issues.\r\n\r\nBreakouts, in particular, have become so common that mask acne has been dubbed “maskne” on the internet. While you can’t ditch the mask, there are steps you can take to prevent and treat mask-related acne to enjoy a safe summer with healthy skin.\r\n\r\nWhat causes mask acne?\r\n\r\nAcne usually develops when pores get clogged by oil, dead skin cells, makeup, dirt, or bacteria. This can lead to blackheads, whiteheads, or pimples that can vary in size and type, depending on how infected they get.\r\n\r\nAdopting a simple skin-care routine—including cleansing, exfoliating, moisturizing, and wearing sunscreen—helps manage acne because it helps with the skin’s natural shedding process. Regular cleansing and exfoliating ensures that all that gunk and dead skin cells are removed rather than clogging your pores. Moisturizing and wearing sunscreen helps ensure the skin’s protective outer layer functions properly.\r\n\r\nBut wearing a face mask can interfere with that process. Instead of those dead skin cells shedding “throughout the day, they now get clogged in your pores,” Carrie L. Kovarik, M.D., an associate professor of dermatology at University of Pennsylvania and a member of the American Association of Dermatology’s (AAD) COVID-19 task force, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nMasks also provide the perfect humid environment for bacteria to grow in our skin, which can lead to a breakout, Noelani Gonzalez, M.D., director of cosmetic dermatology at Mount Sinai, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nHow can you treat mask acne?\r\n\r\nIf you’re dealing with an active mask acne breakout there are ways to treat it—and the methods aren’t so different from the way you’d treat regular acne.\r\n\r\nFor milder cases, classic over-the-counter acne-fighting ingredients like benzoyl peroxide (which kills the bacteria associated with acne) and salicylic acid (a chemical exfoliant that helps unclog pores, should be your go-tos, Dr. Gonzalez says. You can try using a benzoyl peroxide-containing spot treatment, such as Neutrogena On-the-Spot Acne Treatment ($6, Amazon) or La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Acne Treatment ($30, Amazon). And for salicylic acid products, look for gentle acne cleansers, such as Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser ($11, Ulta) or First Aid Beauty Acne Clearing Charcoal Cleanser ($24, Dermstore).\r\n\r\nBut for more severe acne, meaning it’s inflamed or you’re dealing with deep, cystic pimples, a dermatologist might prescribe other treatments such as anti-inflammatory cortisone creams or retinoid medications, which speed up the skin’s natural cell turnover process.\r\n\r\nHowever, both prescription and over-the-counter acne remedies can be irritating, especially if you have sensitive skin or you’re also dealing with raw, red, inflamed areas of skin. In these cases, a dermatologist may recommend you use acne treatments less frequently or hold off on treating the acne altogether until the raw areas of your skin heals. So the right treatment for you may depend on the exact type of problem you develop and your skin type.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve tried over-the-counter options without success, then it’s best to check in with a board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Gonzalez says. Many dermatologists are now offering video consultations as well.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to prevent mask acne?\r\n\r\nSince we’re going to be wearing masks for a while, managing mask acne isn’t going to be a one-time deal. It will require developing both treatment and ongoing prevention habits to keep your skin clear. And, because mask-related acne doesn’t just affect those who tend to be more acne-prone in general, dermatologists recommend that everyone practice good mask-wearing hygiene.\r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nThe first step is to choose a mask that allows your skin (and you) to breathe while also protecting others and yourself from the spread of coronavirus. To accomplish that, the mask should sit snugly but comfortably on your face and should cover both your mouth and nose, SELF explained previously.\r\n\r\n“I recommend soft fabrics, something like cotton or silk,” Dr. Gonzalez says. “They are materials that tend to be more gentle and breathable on the skin, versus synthetic materials that tend to be harsher on the skin.” Here are a few cloth masks to check out as well as recommendations for those looking to work out in a mask.\r\n\r\nAfter choosing a well-fitting mask that doesn’t irritate your skin, it’s time to think about what you put under it. Choosing skin care and makeup products that are labeled non-comedogenic or oil-free underneath the mask can help reduce chances of breakouts. But Dr. Gonzalez suggests avoiding makeup under your mask entirely—especially heavy foundations and multiple layers of products, which can clog pores and lead to acne.\r\n\r\nInstead, wear a moisturizer with at least SPF 30, Dr. Gonzalez says. Not only will this protect your skin from UV rays, but wearing sunscreen can also help prevent other mask-related skin issues, such as tan lines. And the moisturizing helps reduce friction and chafing.\r\n\r\nAfter a long day of wearing your mask, use a gentle cleanser to wash your face to remove all the accumulated debris and oil, Dr. Kovarik says. But dry skin is another common face mask-related skin issue, so make sure to moisturize immediately after washing your face. Kovarik recommends using a moisturizer with ceramides, which help lock moisture into your skin, and/or hyaluronic acid, which has a hydrating effect.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re thinking about adding anything new to your daily skin-care routine, Dr. Gonzalez recommends against starting any new harsh treatments for your skin. Adding products like harsh chemical peels can make the skin more sensitive “and should be avoided because that’ll make your skin more prone to breaking out,” she says.\r\n\r\nHow to wash your mask:\r\n\r\nYour face isn’t the only thing you need to wash! In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend washing cloth masks after each use, which helps remove oils and dead skin that collect inside the mask. To do so, use warm water and a gentle detergent that doesn’t irritate the skin.\r\n\r\nLook for detergents that are free of added colors and fragrances, which are common skin irritants, Dr. Kovarik says. This will ensure that you’re being gentle on sensitive or irritated skin and will reduce the chances of developing a reaction like contact dermatitis.\r\n\r\nAcne isn’t the only mask-related skin issue you might experience.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other skin issues that may arise during the summer of face masks. For instance, you may need to take extra care with your lips to prevent irritation. Unless you have a cone-shaped mask, “the lips are going to be the first thing your mask is going to touch,” Dr. Kovarik says. She recommends using a lip balm or Vaseline ($9 for a pack of 3, Amazon) to protect them.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you have a skin condition like rosacea or eczema, the irritation from face masks may trigger your symptoms. To manage that, definitely keep up the treatment plan that your dermatologist recommended for you, but get in touch with your derm if that plan is no longer enough to manage the flares.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:21:39', '2021-05-28 19:21:37', '/resources/images/wps10.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/mask-acne', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (142, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Back Acne for Good', 'And when to talk to a dermatologist.', '![img](/resources/images/wps11.png) \r\n\r\nFace acne is a common—and frustrating—skin condition to manage. And figuring out how to get rid of back acne is no different. For some people, back acne causes small pimples, while others deal with large cystic acne zits, which can be deep, painful, and pus-filled. And because back acne can be caused by external factors, particularly working out and wearing sweaty clothes, it can be stubborn to treat with the usual acne remedies—even if they work for the pimples on your face.\r\n\r\nSo what actually is back acne? And how can you treat it effectively? Here’s what you need to know about how to get rid of back acne for good.\r\n\r\nWhat causes back acne?\r\n\r\n“Acne is caused by increased oil production, bacteria, pore blockage, and irregular skin cell turnover,” board-certified dermatologist Eric Meinhardt, M.D., tells SELF, and that goes for your face and your back. Sebaceous glands in the skin produce oil, which can collect along with dead skin cells in the pores, plugging them up and giving bacteria a perfect breeding ground, all of which can lead to redness, whiteheads, blackheads, and sometimes infection.\r\n\r\nHormones can play a large role, which is why you might break out more around your period, for instance. And if you’ve noticed that your breakouts pop up in similar places as it does for other family members, that could signal that your acne has a hereditary component, Dr. Meinhardt says.\r\n\r\nWhile the root causes of zits are basically the same in both places, the skin on your face is very different from the skin on your back, which has its upsides and downsides. The skin on the face has more blood supply, Dr. Meinhardt says, which helps acne heal faster and reduces scarring. But the skin on the back is much thicker than the skin on the face (specifically the second layer, called the dermis). That means that the back is more resilient and can handle stronger treatments, scrubs, and exfoliants that would be considered too harsh for the face.\r\n\r\nHowever, not everything that looks like acne on your back is actually acne. For instance, so-called fungal acne tends to appear on the back and chest area and forms uniform red bumps. But traditional acne treatments won’t help manage it at all. So if you’re not sure what your issue really is, get checked out by a professional.\r\n\r\nHow can you treat—and prevent—back acne?\r\n\r\nTreating back acne can be a challenge, but there are some straightforward steps you can take at home that will help manage it, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). Here’s how to get rid of back acne for good:\r\n\r\nLook for benzoyl peroxide. Of all the over-the-counter acne medication options you have, the AAD suggests starting with benzoyl peroxide. This ingredient works by killing bacteria that fuel acne. The AAD recommends using a wash containing benzoyl peroxide by letting it sit on your skin for two to five minutes in the shower daily and then rinsing it off. They also suggest starting with a concentration of 5.3% and only going higher than that if a lower concentration isn’t enough. Although the skin on your back isn’t as sensitive as the skin on your face, high concentrations of benzoyl peroxide can cause side effects, so it’s still smart to start at a lower level and work your way up only if needed.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nPaula’s Choice Clear Extra Strength Daily Skin Clearing Treatment, $19, Amazon\r\n\r\nSLMD BP Body Wash, $35, Target\r\n\r\nPanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash 10%, $11, Target\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nTry a retinoid. Retinoids, particularly adapalene, are another great OTC option for treating acne. They work by speeding up the skin’s natural cell turnover process, which helps unclog pores and resolve acne more quickly. “Retinoids not only treat the acne you have today, they also change the way the cells turn over, reducing your development of acne tomorrow,” Heidi Waldorf, M.D., the director of laser and cosmetic dermatology at the Mount Sinai Hospital, tells SELF. These are especially effective when used alongside benzoyl peroxide, the AAD says. To make sure you don’t miss a spot when applying topical creams and gels, Waldorf recommends using an applicator like the L’applique to help you reach those hard-to-get-to areas.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nDifferin Gel, $15, Amazon\r\n\r\nLa Roche Posay Effaclar Adapalene Gel 0.1%, $30, Amazon\r\n\r\nAcne Free Adapalene Gel 0.1%, $12, Amazon\r\n\r\nSalicylic acid might work too. This classic acne-fighting ingredient works as a chemical exfoliant, breaking down dead skin cells and getting deep into pores to clear them out. It’s a common ingredient in spot treatments, but those might be hard to use on your back. “Salicylic acid is attracted to the oil in the sebaceous glands, and once there, it helps to loosen the sticky cells and oil to clear clogged hair follicles,” Dr. Waldorf says.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nNeutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, $7, Target\r\n\r\nMurad Acne Body Wash, $44, Murad\r\n\r\nDermaologica Clearing Skin Wash, $62, Ulta\r\n\r\nDevelop good workout habits. Working out and sweating can contribute to body acne, so it’s important to be mindful when you’re engaging in those activities. The AAD recommends opting for looser fitting clothes made of sweat-wicking fabric or cotton to avoid sweat accumulating next to your skin. It’s also important to change out of sweaty workout clothes as soon as possible and to wash them after every use.\r\n\r\nBe gentle with your skin. If your skin has acne, it will require a gentle touch. That means using a gentle body wash or cleanser—not a harsh scrub. It also means avoiding the very tempting urge to pick your acne as much as possible.\r\n\r\nWear sunscreen. Sun exposure can actually worsen acne and cause post-acne dark spots to become darker. Although wearing sunscreen is always important, it’s especially important if you’re trying to manage back acne. Look for products that are non-comedogenic and oil-free, which means they won’t contribute to clogged pores.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nEltaMD UV Lotion Broad-Spectrum SPF 30, $36, Dermstore\r\n\r\nHawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch Lotion Sunscreen SPF 50, $19, Amazon\r\n\r\nClinique Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Mineral Sunscreen For Body, $32, Sephora\r\n\r\nAvoid anything that rubs your skin. The friction caused by a backpack or or shoulder bag can worsen acne, especially if you’re also sweaty. If you can, hold your purse in your hand or rest the strap on your arm.\r\n\r\nTake care when washing your hair. The way you wash your hair can have an impact on bacne. While the oils in hair treatments might be good for nourishing your strands, they can be bad news for the skin on your back. That’s why Debbie Palmer, D.O., tells SELF that you should rinse conditioner off to the side instead of letting it run down your back. Also, try waiting until you’ve completed all of your hair treatments before washing your body. That way you can wash off any oily residue, clearing the way for your acne treatments to do their thing.\r\n\r\nWhen should you see a dermatologist for back acne?\r\n\r\nYou can probably treat mild to moderate back acne at home with over-the-counter options. But if your acne is more severe, meaning you have deep, painful cysts, you should see a dermatologist for help. They may prescribe stronger medications, like prescription retinoids, that can help clear your acne.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not sure if your acne is actually acne, you should also see your dermatologist. There are other skin conditions, including “fungal acne,” that can look a lot like regular acne but that require more specialized treatments.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:25:22', '2021-05-28 19:25:23', '/resources/images/wps11.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/how-to-get-rid-of-back-acne', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (143, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Tan Lines—Without Any More Sun Exposure', 'You don\'t need to risk more sun!', '![img](/resources/images/wps12.png)\r\n\r\nWhen you get home from a long day in the sun, your first instinct might be to figure out how to get rid of those tan lines you accidentally picked up. Of course, you were wearing sunscreen and covering up as much as possible, but even those of us most dedicated to sun safety slip up every once in a while—and pay the price in sun damage and annoying tan lines.\r\n\r\nYou might assume that, to even out your skin tone, you need to get back in the sun or into a tanning bed. But that will only expose you to even more sun damage—and there are plenty of ways to get rid of tan lines without that. In fact, as SELF explained previously, tanning is the direct result of UV exposure to the skin. Over time, that kind of UV exposure can lead to more permanent damage to the skin as well as skin cancer, the CDC says.\r\n\r\nSo, while it’s understandable that you’d want to address the cosmetic concerns of tan lines, it’s important not to use intentional tanning—indoor or outdoor—to do that. Below, check out how to get rid of tan lines with a few safer tips. Not only will your skin tone even out, but your skin might also feel smoother, more moisturized, and more nourished after taking on some of these tips.\r\n\r\n1. Wear sunscreen.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to lighten a tan or even out your skin tone, sunscreen is undoubtedly the most important part of your skin-care arsenal. Wearing sunscreen every day—yes, every single day—will help protect you from UV damage and therefore prevent the parts of your skin that are already tan from continuing to get tan.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nLa Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Milk Sunscreen SPF 100 ($25, Amazon)\r\n\r\nCOOLA Mineral Body Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 ($32, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nBanana Boat Simply Protect Sensitive Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50+ ($8, Target)\r\n\r\n2. Gently exfoliate.\r\n\r\nExfoliating your skin helps remove the outer layer of dead skin cells so that the newer, smoother skin cells underneath are revealed. You can do this with a physical exfoliant, like a scrub, or with a chemical exfoliant, a product containing something like glycolic acid or lactic acid. Over time, this will help your tan to fade, and it’s an important step before using a self-tanner, if that’s something you’re interested in. But be careful not to do this too often because exfoliating with products like these can irritate those with dry or sensitive skin.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nGlytone Exfoliating Body Wash ($32, Amazon)\r\n\r\nPaula’s Choice Weightless Body Treatment 2% BHA ($28, Paula’s Choice)\r\n\r\nShea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Skin Renewal Recipe Body Scrub ($11, Ulta)\r\n\r\n3. Moisturize and use self-tanner.\r\n\r\nAfter exfoliating in the shower, dry off well and load your fave moisturizer onto the already tanned areas to help create a barrier for when you apply the self-tanner. Then dip a makeup sponge into a quality self-tanning gel and blend color evenly into the paler skin; hang tight until it feels dry. You can use a self-tanning cream, but I like gel because it\'s easier to apply on smaller areas of skin. Repeat the exfoliate, lotion, tan routine daily until lines aren\'t noticeable.\r\n\r\nLung Cancer: Myth Vs. Fact\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nSt. Tropez Self Tan Purity Bronzing Water Gel ($44, Ulta)\r\n\r\nSOL Body Gradual Sunless Tanning Lotion ($16, Ulta)\r\n\r\nTan Luxe THE BODY Illuminating Self Tan Drops ($59, Sephora)\r\n\r\n4. Use body makeup.\r\n\r\nIf you’d prefer to cover your tan lines, try using body makeup. First, take off any clothes near tan lines to avoid staining your clothes and missing major areas. Then dip your index finger into a matte liquid bronzer or body foundation and tap a thin layer over the pale spots. Give it 15 seconds or so to dry, then reassess. If you need to go darker, add another layer. Once you nail your skin tone, gently sweep a bronzing powder over the entire area to help blend the faux with the glow, and finish with a spritz of makeup setting spray.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nDermablend Leg and Body Makeup ($34, Ulta)\r\n\r\nKKW Beauty Skin Perfecting Body Foundation ($45, Ulta)\r\n\r\nDior Backstage Face & Body Foundation ($40, Sephora)\r\n\r\n5. Try body products with vitamin C.\r\n\r\nIf those methods aren’t enough for you, you can also try using body products containing ingredients like vitamin C and niacinamide, which can help lighten hyperpigmentation. These are ingredients commonly used in skin-care products for the face aimed at reducing hyperpigmentation and just overall evening out skin tone. However, they generally take a few weeks to see a noticeable difference.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nM-61 Vitablast C Body Butter ($24, bluemercury)\r\n\r\nOne Love Organics Vitamin C Body Oil ($58, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nAveeno Positively Radiant Body Lotion ($28, Amazon)\r\n\r\n6. Wait it out.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get rid of tan lines is to just wait for them to naturally fade on their own while avoiding sun exposure as much as possible. In fact, your skin cells are constantly in a state of turning over, meaning the newer cells are pushed to the surface as the older skin cells die and flake off. So it’s estimated that, within about 7 to 10 days, your tan will fade significantly—as long as you’re not reexposing the skin to UV light.\r\n\r\nHow to prevent tan lines in the future:\r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent annoying tan lines in the future is to avoid getting a tan at all. That requires wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 anytime you’re exposed to the sun. But it also means trying to stay in the shade as much as possible, wearing clothing that covers your skin (and maybe even contains extra sun protection), and not spending extended time outdoors when the sun is at its strongest.\r\n\r\nTan lines certainly aren’t the most dangerous effect of sun exposure, but they can be annoying—and a sign that you may need to bump up your sun-safety habits.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:25:57', '2021-05-28 19:25:58', '/resources/images/wps12.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/beauty-how-to-fix-tan-lines', 0, 0);

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to keeping breakouts at a minimum, I have a handful of holy-grail skincare go-tos to help appease my finicky, combination skin. As a person who’s tried to do away with zits since the early days of middle school, I have a pretty clear understanding nowadays of the products that will work for me, from the moment they first touch my face. Since one of my long-term skin goals is to have the flexibility to just wear makeup for funsies instead of out of necessity, locking down an effective skincare routine as a foundation is key.\r\n\r\nAs the foundation of any good skincare routine, cleansing is a must, but finding a good cleanser has been the missing piece of my routine for a while. I typically rotate between a few that do the job, but don’t really check off all the boxes for my skin-care needs, which is why I was so surprised by how instantly I took to Space Wash, the new cleanser from buzzy skin-care brand, Starface.\r\n\r\nI’d become a fast fan of buzzy skin-care brand Starface (which was started by former ELLE beauty editor Julie Schott, who, it must be said, has amazing skin) after discovering how effective their cult-favorite Hydro-Stars were. The stars are the brand’s first- and best-sellers, hydrocolloid pimple patches in the shape of—you guessed it—stars, that make even the act of healing zits look cute, and their first-ever cleanser is similarly well-suited for my combination and acne-prone skin.\r\n\r\nSome cleansers have stung my eyes mid-wash, smelled overly perfumed, or left my skin feeling super tight and uncomfortable, but Space Wash is different—this cleanser truly gets me. Formulated with soothing ingredients like sage leaf and calendula flower extract, as well as white willow bark extract to help exfoliate skin, this cleanser has rewarded me with clarity and smoothness every time I use it. It has a barely-there scent with no added fragrance, feels very gentle on my skin, and doesn’t leave behind a sticky residue once it’s rinsed off. Not to mention, it’s comedogenic, dermatologist-tested, oil-free, and vegan.\r\n\r\nAfter rinsing my face, I squirt a nickel-size amount of the cleanser in one palm, add a hint of water, then rub my hands together to form a light, frothy lather. Space Wash is extra silky when I massage it on my face, and once it’s rinsed off, my skin feels clean but not stripped, a common characteristic of other acne-friendly cleansers I’ve used in the past. Not only is its formula absolutely everything for my skin, but the vibrant Space Wash tube (like all Starface products) is one of the best-looking beauty products on my shelf, and also completely recyclable once I’m done with it, which means it’s better for the environment, too.\r\n\r\nI’m so into this cleanser, that at this rate, I’m at a danger of overdoing it on my face washing routine. But if I do get a little heavy handed, I’m lucky that the product is also pretty affordable at $16 a tube and available for auto-refills, which I have to wager that you’ll want to do.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:26:20', '2021-05-28 19:26:21', '/resources/images/wps13.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/starface-space-wash-cleanser-review', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (145, 14, 'This Is Why Your Skin Is All Over the Place Right Now', 'Raise your hand if you’re breaking out!', '![img](/resources/images/wps14.png)\r\n\r\nNow that most of us are spending extra time at home thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, we’ve started to tune in to our skin in a way we didn’t necessarily have time for previously—and some of us aren’t too pleased with what we’re seeing.\r\n\r\nFor some, this time at home has finally allowed us to scale back on all those products, revealing clear skin with—surprise!—a minimalist routine. But others are finding themselves battling breakout after breakout, Carol Cheng, M.D., assistant clinical professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the Acne Procedure Clinic at UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, tells SELF. “I’ve seen it go both ways,” she says, “and I can see a number of reasons why.”\r\n\r\nWhether your skin is getting better these days or…not, here’s what might be behind those changes.\r\n\r\nThere are tons of factors that could be affecting your skin right now—for better or worse.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to remember that some acne triggers aren’t going to change right now, Dr. Cheng says, such as the hormonal influence on skin and acne. But here are a few things that might be making a difference on your skin.\r\n\r\nStress, sleep, diet. People’s skin may respond to things like changes in stress, diet, and sleep in different ways, and we don’t totally understand why, Dr. Cheng says. But if you notice that your skin is behaving badly right now, it makes sense that it might have something to do with these other big changes in your environment and behavior right now.\r\n\r\nUsing fewer skin-care products. “Part of what’s helping people is they are cleaning up their routine,” Mary L. Stevenson, M.D., assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. Not having to go into an office every day is giving us the freedom to cut back on our skin-care regimens and really take the time to be thoughtful about what we’re putting on our face—perhaps we’re even doing it over the course of a morning rather than in 30 seconds before rushing out the door!\r\n\r\nFor some, that minimalism might make them realize they didn’t actually need all those products and that some of them might have even been making their skin break out or irritated. But some of us really do rely on those products to keep our skin calm and clear, Dr. Stevenson says, so taking a break could have a detrimental effect on our skin.\r\n\r\nWorking out at home. If you, like many of us, have gone from working out at your favorite gym or studio class to exclusively working out at home, that could also be having an effect on your skin, Dr. Stevenson says. At home you have time to take off your makeup, you’re not working out in the same room as 25 other sweaty people, and you can clean off all that sweat immediately after you’re done rather than waiting a full subway ride to shower at home. Having that much newfound control over your fitness environment could lead to overall less irritated and less acne-prone skin.\r\n\r\nWearing less makeup. As with skin care, a lot of us are finding that there’s less of a need to wear makeup daily because we’re leaving home so much less often. Personally, outside of the occasional Zoom call, I basically don’t wear any makeup these days, and my skin has been pretty into it. That could be because the products I was wearing are irritating, or it could just be the simple fact of not having an extra layer of stuff on top of my skin helps prevent acne. “The most irritating thing we do is too much,” Dr. Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nSitting in front of screens constantly. Yes, if you are prone to hyperpigmentation, the blue light from your devices might exacerbate that, SELF explained previously. But the bigger risk of sitting idly in front of your laptop, phone, tablet, et cetera for hours on end is that you’re more likely to absent-mindedly pick at or touch your face, Dr. Cheng says, which can contribute to acne and interfere with the skin’s normal healing process.\r\n\r\nWearing face masks. If you’ve been wearing a face mask when in public (which, yes, you should be), you’ve probably noticed how quickly it can get hot and sweaty under there. You may have also noticed that you’re getting acne in the areas of your face that are under the mask. That could be thanks to acne mechanica, Dr. Cheng says, which is caused by something physically trapping that warmth and sweat on your skin.\r\n\r\nTake this opportunity to work on your relationship with your skin.\r\n\r\nOne of the few, tiny silver linings of having this time at home is being able to take the opportunity to more closely monitor your skin and how your products affect it, Dr. Stevenson says. But it’s also important to recognize when you’re paying too much attention to your skin, which can be especially difficult right now if you deal with OCD or a body-focused repetitive disorder that involves skin picking.\r\n\r\nIn general, Dr. Stevenson recommends checking in on your skin at three points during the day: when you wake up, when you get home from work, and before you go to bed. Right now, obviously, many of us don’t get home from work, we just are home and also working. So the blurring of that line can be a little difficult to navigate. It might require you to pick a time when your work day is usually over. Still, try to take those moments—and only those moments—throughout the day to tune in to your skin. And, as SELF explained previously, setting time limits like this is one crucial strategy to managing skin-fueled OCD symptoms.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it’s completely understandable that, with so many changes in our lives, our skin might be going through some changes too. And, for most of us, the changes will be relatively minor and easy to manage with our usual acne- and irritation-fighting strategies. But if your skin changes are causing extra stress or you don’t know what’s causing those changes, it’s worth checking in with a dermatologist about what you can do to deal with them.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:26:40', '2021-05-28 19:26:47', '/resources/images/wps14.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/skin-changes', 0, 0);

They are stylish, versatile, and budget-friendly. As do-it-yourself projects go, they’re also rather simple to create and install. Your biggest challenge will be choosing just one DIY pipe shelf idea to stick to!', '## 17 Awesome DIY Pipe Shelves for Budget-friendly Organizing\r\n\r\n![DIY pipe shelves](/resources/images/best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-pinterest-share-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nJust in case you haven’t been engaging in the DIY home decor space recently, let us tell you about these design gems. DIY pipe shelves use metal pipes and fittings combined with (usually) wood to create shelving units. These units may sit on the floor or be mounted to the ceiling or wall. The design is industrial-inspired and looks absolutely perfect with minimalist decor, boho-chic design, and eclectic aesthetics, but it can also be worked into just about any design theme. That’s because there is so much versatility in the color and shape of metal and wood used.\r\n\r\nIf you’re going for a raw, edgy look, then check out the ideas with black pipe and raw or dark finished wood. If you want a softer, more sophisticated version, then look at the antiqued designs or those with more structural elements. For a more creative flair try copper pipes or fully painted wood shelves. You can really mix and match the possibilities until you come up witha look you absolutely love.\r\n\r\nLet’s talk wall mounting, folks. These designs make incredible wall-mounted and floating shelving units. You can also ceiling mount shelves for a unique spin on the theme. For pieces on the floor, you can use pipe fittings or swap them out for wheels to create a movable unit.\r\n\r\nThink about where you want your shelves to go, what you plan to put on them, and how you want them to look in the context of the rest of the room. This can make your DIY design process easier and ensure that you choose the perfect DIY pipe shelves for you!\r\n\r\n## 1. Simple and Stylish Pipe Wall Shelf\r\n\r\n![Simple and Stylish Pipe Wall Shelf](/resources/images/01-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis do-it-yourself wall unit is simple, sturdy, and looks amazing. If you want something that can handle heavier loads like these printers, then anchoring to the wall like this is a brilliant idea. You won’t have to worry about bumping into things. Woven baskets are a fabulous idea for organizing odds and ends in a pipe and wood shelving unit like this. Add a couple of purely decorative items to soften the look and make it homier. Another great thing about this type of design is that you can make it as wide or as tall as you need to. The possibilities are endless!\r\n\r\n## 2. Minimalist Floating Bar Shelves with Iron Pipe Brackets\r\n\r\n![Minimalist Floating Bar Shelves with Iron Pipe Brackets](/resources/images/02-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWant to have a bar in your home but short on space? This floating shelf idea is a stylish solution! In fact, this looks so amazing that you may want to opt for a floating DIY pipe shelf idea for a bar no matter how big or small your home is. A project like this couldn’t be easier. Forget a weekend – you can pull this off in an hour! All you need are the necessary pipes and brackets, a secure wall mount, and a piece of finished wood. Arrange your glasses and spirits on the shelf and you’ve got yourself a bar. Cheers!\r\n\r\n## 3. L-Bracket Pipe and Wood Wall Shelving\r\n\r\n![L-Bracket Pipe and Wood Wall Shelving](/resources/images/03-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not exactly a floating shelf, but it gives you the same effect while also showing off a little bit of raw, industrial style. Using a pipe configured into an L-bracket makes for a super-secure shelf. It’s hard to believe that something this pretty can be made with a couple of pipes and a two-by-four, but here’s your proof! You can play with the pipe color – either by choosing a different metal or painting it – to suit your decor. You can also mix this up by finishing the wood differently. A darker finish would look warm and masculine. A whitewash would look great with farmhouse decor.\r\n\r\n## 4. Hip Portable Pipe and Wood Shelving Unit\r\n\r\n![Hip Portable Pipe and Wood Shelving Unit](/resources/images/04-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh man, this movable shelving unit is inspiring major design envy! This is an awesome example of how (almost) raw wood and galvanized pipe furniture can perfectly complement the eclectic decor. This particular set of DIY pipe shelves is particularly brilliant because it’s on wheels! If you need to be able to move things around in your home (say for a guest staying over or in a multipurpose room) this makes it incredibly easy to do. Just roll the shelving unit wherever you want it! You can push it out of the way, use it as a room divider, or change it out with another piece of furniture in a snap.\r\n\r\n## 5. Warm and Welcoming Pewter and Wood Shelves\r\n\r\n![Warm and Welcoming Pewter and Wood Shelves](/resources/images/05-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about DIY pipe shelves is that you can customize them like none other. Simply cut the wood pieces down to the length and width to fit into your living space and get the pipes cut to match. Just look at this adorable solution for floating bathroom shelves. Bathrooms can be full of odd nooks, crannies, and empty walls that can look awkward when they’re bare. Add a couple of floating shelves and some cleverly disguised storage decor to liven up the space.\r\n\r\n## 6. Boho Industrial Iron and Wood Floating Shelves\r\n\r\n![Boho Industrial Iron and Wood Floating Shelves](/resources/images/06-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOften DIY pipe shelf design is categorized as “industrial” decor, but that doesn’t mean you have to live in an NYC loft to make it work. Just look at how gorgeous these soft and frilly ceramics look atop industrial wood and iron floating shelves! This particular style can lend a touch of modernity to farmhouse or shabby chic style, which can sometimes look a bit dated. Keeping things simple and sparse will only make this decor look more stylish. If you like to keep things minimal – or just can’t afford a bunch of stuff – then this decor theme will work especially well for you as minimalist simplicity is the name of the industrial game.\r\n\r\n## 7. Office-Ready Professional DIY Pipe Shelf Design\r\n\r\n![Office-Ready Professional DIY Pipe Shelf Design](/resources/images/07-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether your office is in your home or your place of work, this DIY pipe shelf idea will look professional and get the job done. Using a thinner pipe and rounding the corners of the wooden shelves adds some refinement to this rustic style. The dark finish on the wood also makes a great match for a professional environment. This is a much more attractive, fashionable, and unique design than your run of the mill particle board shelving unit. Since the shelves are exposed, organize your items with baskets, book ends, and magazine boxes.\r\n\r\n## 8. Complete DIY Wall Unit with Jointed Pipe and Wood Shelves\r\n\r\n![Complete DIY Wall Unit with Jointed Pipe and Wood Shelves](/resources/images/08-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA wood and pipe wall shelf can be functional and fashionable. Just take a look at this stunning design. A pre-fab shelving unit of this size would easily cost five or six times more than this do-it-yourself version. The simple, symmetrical design sets the perfect backdrop for a collection of your favorite things. This is absolutely perfect for rooms with big, empty walls that are begging for a statement piece. Place larger pieces on higher shelves and smaller pieces on lower shelves to perfectly balance the space. Hot tip: colored glass adds interesting color and texture while still appearing spacious and letting light through.\r\n\r\n## 9. Rustic Ceiling-Mounted Wood and Pipe Craft Shelves\r\n\r\n![Rustic Ceiling-Mounted Wood and Pipe Craft Shelves](/resources/images/09-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlip it and reverse it! Create DIY pipe shelves that come from the ceiling instead of the floor to expand your working and storage space. This is a genius solution for a craft room like this, for an office, a laundry room, a kitchen – any room where you have furniture on the floor, need storage and have wall space that is underutilized. Aside from the use of a ladder, this is about as simple as installing DIY pipe shelves from the floor. It looks amazing and gives you a very practical solution for storing your things.\r\n\r\n## 10. Gorgeous Floor-to-Ceiling Dimensional Pipe Shelving Display\r\n\r\n![Gorgeous Floor-to-Ceiling Dimensional Pipe Shelving Display](/resources/images/10-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet creative with your design with this elegant solution. One of the great things about a DIY pipe shelf idea is that you can mix and match width and height to just the way you want it. A wall unit like this is a perfect example. You can plan your shelves to accommodate works of art or other decorative items. Having various shelf heights also adds an artistic appearance that’s less utilitarian and more design-focused. This particular room is an awesome example of an eclectic, bohemian design blending perfectly with a warm industrial pipe shelving design.\r\n\r\n## 11. Sturdy, Affordable, and Chic Pipe Bookshelf\r\n\r\n![Sturdy, Affordable, and Chic Pipe Bookshelf](/resources/images/11-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIY pipe shelf design is incredibly sturdy. You can load those shelves up with super heavy items like a collection of books or records with no problem at all. This shelf is proof positive of the load-bearing capacity of this design choice. If you’ve ever dreamt of having a personal library, this is a great way to put it on display. Having a unit for these very heavy items is best to be placed on the floor. A properly mounted pipe wall shelf can also handle a lot, but a floor mount is your safest choice.\r\n\r\n## 12. DIY Copper Pipe Transformation Idea\r\n\r\n![DIY Copper Pipe Transformation Idea](/resources/images/12-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepending on the design of your home, you may want to opt for a different shade of metal in your DIY pipe shelves. You can pretty easily find pipes in black, silver or copper. The price differences in these materials can be significant, so to change colors on a budget you can simply spray paint the pipes instead. Just pick up a can of metallic spray paint in the color of your choice. Spray the pipes and allow them to dry before installing them. Because these are overall stationary objects, there’s not a huge risk of paint chipping or wear and tear.\r\n\r\n## 13. Simple Copper Pipe and White Wood Floating Shelves\r\n\r\n![Simple Copper Pipe and White Wood Floating Shelves](/resources/images/13-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing copper instead of black or galvanized steel pipes can completely change the look of your DIY pipe shelf design. The appearance is lighter and brighter. It goes beautifully with white shelves like these, or with wooden shelves. If you want an almost invisible look, then painting the shelves to match the wall they are mounted on will do the trick. The glossy finish also goes nicely with the brightness of the copper color. You can also tie in the soft, warm metallics with the items you display on the shelves, like the copper-hued vase and metallic frame.\r\n\r\n## 14. Warm Industrial Floor-to-Ceiling DIY Pipe Shelves\r\n\r\n![Warm Industrial Floor-to-Ceiling DIY Pipe Shelves](/resources/images/14-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can make your ceilings appear taller and create attractive display and storage space by taking your pipe wall shelf from floor to ceiling. The vertical lines create an optical illusion of height which can really open up your space. You can double down by varying the height of the shelves as well. Adding in a double-tall shelf adds more open space and contributes to the visual effect of more height. Add a collection of beautiful things, books, and mementos to create a truly gorgeous design. The chic, industrial look really lends itself to displaying eclectic decor.\r\n\r\n## 15. Indoor Garden on Shelves Made of Pipe and Wood\r\n\r\n![Indoor Garden on Shelves Made of Pipe and Wood](/resources/images/15-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArt, books, and dishes aren’t the only things that can go on your shelves. How about some plants instead? Just check out this brilliant DIY pipe shelf design for an indoor garden! The shelves hold the plants and the lights are mounted on the bottom of each shelf to shine on the surface below. This is such a cool way to grow things like herbs and microgreens indoors or even to house your outdoor plants in the winter months. You could even paint the light fixtures to coordinate with the shelving unit – or add a creative design.\r\n\r\n## 16.

Don’t believe us? Just take a look at this copper pipe shelving idea. The warm copper color almost blends in with the color of the wood. It’s a much softer look than black pipes, but just as functional. Using a wood finish with a reddish stain is a great idea to go with copper pipes. This just goes to show that the shade of wood or metal used in these designs can dramatically change the way the final result looks. It’s also helpful to know that if you’re unhappy with your design you can change it pretty easily with a can of paint!\r\n\r\n## 17.

This style would look lovely in a more traditional home or with country-style decor. It is simple, elegant, and functional all at the same time. This piece works great in a home office space, but could just as easily hold items in the kitchen or serve as a bedside table.\r\n\r\n## 17 Amazing-looking DIY Pipe Shelves for Every Budget\r\n\r\nWhat an incredible collection of creative design ideas! It’s hard to believe that just two elements – pipe and wood – can create such a variety of styles and ideas. If you’re not sure where to start, any employee at your local hardware or home improvement store can walk you through the basics of putting together the pipes and fixtures to create the shape you want. They can also help you determine what types of screws or other hardware you’ll need to attach the pipes to the wood as well as the walls or ceiling if you’re doing a mounted version.

When you need something that you know you put in your pantry, it may take several minutes to find it. Your pantry situation might even be worse than badly disorganized. You may dread opening it because you fear being buried under the mound of everything you have stuffed into it and never being heard from again.', '## 24 Pantry Shelving Ideas that will Make You more Productive in the Kitchen\r\n\r\n![Pantry Shelving Ideas](/resources/images/best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-pinterest-share-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nPantries get stuffed with all kinds of stuff like canned and packaged foods; snack foods; flavorings like spices, herbs, and cooking vinegars, oils, and wines; small appliances; cookbooks; mixing bowls; baking dishes; small items like cookie cutters and Belgian waffle irons; napkins, paper plates, and paper cups; and if the kitchen sink didn’t already have its own place in the kitchen, it might be stuffed in the pantry as well. Pantries aren’t meant to thwart us with the amount of unorganized stuff that we stuff in them, though. Pantries are actuallymeant to help us locate the things we store in them quickly and easily so that we can go on with preparing the food that we wanted to prepare or preparing the grocery list of things we need to buy.\r\n\r\nWhen you open your pantry, you should be able to reach in and grab what you need in a few seconds or see what you need to add to your grocery list in a minute or two. You shouldn’t have to move things to see what’s behind them or pick up things that fall to the floor when you reach for something else.\r\n\r\nYour pantry problems may only result from disorganization. In that case, using baskets or bins to corral small items, larger bins to hold bulky items, multi-tiered shelving to keep items in view, and a labeling system so that the whole family knows where everything belongs should help.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you may be trying too much stuff on the shelf space in your pantry. In that case, you may need to look for ways to increase your storage space to your pantry. You could create more storage space on the back of the door or on the walls around your pantry. You could also create more storage space in a closet, mudroom, somewhere else in your kitchen or your home and move some of the things that you have in your pantry to the new space.\r\n\r\n## 1.

This pantry organizing idea provides more storage space with adjustable shelves on the door, captures small objects in pull out bins, and uses see-through canisters for products that come in bags, like flour and sugar. The canisters eliminate spills from torn bags, and let you see with a quick glance what is low.\r\n\r\n## 2. Additional Pantry Space Shelving Solution\r\n\r\n![Additional Pantry Space Shelving Solution](/resources/images/02e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpeg)\r\n\r\nSource:elevengables.com\r\n\r\nWhether you don’t have an existing pantry or need more pantry space, kitchen pantry ideas can be created using other shelving such as bookcases. These two shelving units could be built-in, preassembled bookcases, and doors could be added. See-through jars and baskets also help organize this pantry space. An additional pantry storage idea shown here is the plastic bins for cans. The bins are wire mesh that are lower in the front so that you can easily see and remove the items they contain. The cans are stacked on their sides so that they don’t tumble.\r\n\r\n## 3. Pantry Shelving Ideas for the Dining Room\r\n\r\n![Pantry Shelving Ideas for the Dining Room](/resources/images/03e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:asavoryfeast.com\r\n\r\nWith the half-glass doors added to this Billy Bookcase from Ikea, you can actually place your pantry storage unit in the dining room. You might even have room to place two of them side by side. This pantry organization idea will not only help you store pantry items, but it can also act as a credenza and give you a place to store dishes that will display nicely behind the doors. The shelves on this bookcase are adjustable, making it easier to store tall items. Add baskets, bins, and clear jars, and you have created a new location for a pantry storage idea.\r\n\r\n## 4. Using Organizational Items to Maximize Storage Space\r\n\r\n![Using Organizational Items to Maximize Storage Space](/resources/images/04e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:cassandrajed-cassadiva.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nInstead of glass canisters, this pantry storage ideas uses stackable plastic storage containers to reduce wasted space. Place larger containers on the top shelf and pull them forward so that they can be be easily accessed. Use the space behind these containers to store items that aren’t used often. Smaller containers on the next shelf are pushed back because there are so many that you don’t want to move them to get to other items. On the next shelf, a three-tiered rack with a space underneath for foil, plastic wrap, and storage bags makes great use of vertical space. Pull-out bins keep items contained but provide easy access. Finally, hang small plastic-coated wire baskets in whatever sizes you need canned foods, spices, and other items.\r\n\r\n## 5. Labeling Can be Key to Maintaining Organization\r\n\r\n![Labeling Can be Key to Maintaining Organization](/resources/images/05e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:stacygravesinteriors.com\r\n\r\nThis pantry organization idea uses clear plastic bins with handles. The bins have squared edges, so they sit side by side without wasted space. Just make sure you leave enough space between them so that you can remove them easily. The handles help you maintain control of the bin. A multi-tiered shelving unit keeps canned foods accessible. Hanging under-shelf baskets creates vertical storage for linens. However, the best idea here may be labeling the bins so that family members know in what bins items belong when they are done with them. This helps maintain your organized pantry design.\r\n\r\n## 6. Create a Pantry Design for a Closet\r\n\r\n![Create a Pantry Design for a Closet](/resources/images/06e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:thevintagewren.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have a pantry in your home, you can use the pantry shelving ideas generated by this image and create a pantry in a closet, laundry room, mudroom, basement, or garage. The only caution in using some areas is concerns about temperature and humidity control. These concerns depend on the type of food you want to store. Even canned goods should be stored at 70° F or less. If you are going to use a closet, measure its width, and purchase brackets and mesh, wood, or board shelves that will fit across the closet. You can also select mesh or metal ready-to-assemble shelving units that fit your space.\r\n\r\n## 7. Looking for Less Intensive Pantry Organization Ideas\r\n\r\n![Looking for Less Intensive Pantry Organization Ideas](/resources/images/07e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:crazy-wonderful.com\r\n\r\nIf you just need to do a little straightening in your pantry rather than a full scale reorganization with a lot of special containers, try the ideas from this pantry. Baskets hold bulky items, and labeling helps you and your family know where things are. Wire shelving helps create a second tier of shelving over shorter items. Moving spices to baskets on the empty space on the back of the door makes use of that vertical space, and clears up cluttered shelf space making it available for other items. These quick, less expensive kitchen pantry idea will still result in a better organized pantry.\r\n\r\n## 8. Kitchen Pantry Ideas for Creating Larger Pantries\r\n\r\n![Kitchen Pantry Ideas for Creating Larger Pantries](/resources/images/08e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:willscasa.com\r\n\r\nA large walk-in pantry allows you to store groceries and appliances in the pantry, which is not generally possible in most homes. If you would like a larger pantry, you might consider converting a mudroom off of the kitchen, enclosing a space in the kitchen, or using the space under the second floor stairway like this pantry does. In most homes, the space under the stairs is a small, cramped, first-floor half-bath for guests. Using that space would require moving the guest bath to a potentially roomier space on the first floor. If you really want a larger pantry, look around your home and consider your options.\r\n\r\n## 9. Consider Custom Pantry Shelving Ideas\r\n\r\n![Consider Custom Pantry Shelving Ideas](/resources/images/09e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:homeonpoplarcreek.com\r\n\r\nFor a pantry that really works for you, you could design and build a customized pantry or have one built. This would allow you to have the pantry divided into sections intended for specific items. This image shows a shelf that holds the mixer nicely. It also has a space for storing cookie sheets and two pullout baskets. Think about the items that you use a lot, the items that are hard to fit in your cupboards, and the items that are sitting on your counters, and decide if a customized pantry might improve the efficiency of your kitchen.\r\n\r\n## 10. Clever Ways to Add More Storage Space\r\n\r\n![Clever Ways to Add More Storage Space](/resources/images/10e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:eclecticrecipes.com\r\n\r\nThis walk-in pantry with shelves on both sides would be nice to have, but there are some space-increasing ideas in this pantry and in other images when you click on the source link. First, adding pegboard to any wall space in your pantry or on the back of the door allows you to hang utensils, molds, pans, or baskets. On the source page, you will see a pantry where the shelving only goes part way so that a pull-out shelf could be installed increasing storage space. Another pantry storage idea is converting a cupboard into an expanded spice cupboard. Short shelves holding spices are in the back, and then a swing-out spice shelf unit is in the front.\r\n\r\n## 11. Another Coat Closet Conversion Using Crates\r\n\r\n![Another Coat Closet Conversion Using Crates](/resources/images/11e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:momhomeguide.com\r\n\r\nThis is another coat closet converted into a pantry. With a mudroom and other storage available throughout the house, it was possible to move the items in the coat closet. This conversion was then done in a less expensive and more temporary way so that it can easily be converted back into a coat closet or to another use if desired. Rather than buying and installing shelves or purchasing bookcases, crates were assembled to create the needed shelving. You can also use wall space and some of the previous organizational ideas to make the most of this converted closet pantry.\r\n\r\n## 12. Converting a Deep Pantry to Wrap-around Shelves\r\n\r\n![Converting a Deep Pantry to Wrap-around Shelves](/resources/images/12e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:vickiliston.com\r\n\r\nWhile providing ample storage, a pantry with deep shelves poses issues with access and inventory of the products in the back. These issues can be resolved without losing too much storage space by creating wrap-around shelves. Reducing the depth of the current shelves by one half allows you to add shelves on both sides so that you can step in and get a better view and access to the items on the shelves. It also allows more light to reach items in the back of the shelves so that they aren’t hidden.\r\n\r\n## 13. A Reorganization that Recaps Kitchen Pantry Ideas\r\n\r\n![A Reorganization that Recaps Kitchen Pantry Ideas](/resources/images/13e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:livingletterhome.com\r\n\r\nThis pantry provides an opportunity to recap many of the ideas used in the pantries above. A major change in this pantry was that the mesh shelves were replaced by wood shelves. This seriously creates a different attitude toward keeping the pantry organized. The storage containers include clear jars that make taking inventory easier. Baskets help organize products and reduce clutter. Rather than buying three-tiered shelves, you could make your own wood risers, and a Lazy Susan helps access items. The rolling crates under the bottom shelf have pulls that make them great for accessing heavier items.\r\n\r\n## 14. Using Cupboard Space for Storing Pantry Items\r\n\r\n![Using Cupboard Space for Storing Pantry Items](/resources/images/14e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:crayonsandcravings.com\r\n\r\nSometimes you don’t have a choice, you have to use cupboard space for pantry items, and that is when being organized is really important. Using one type of clear containers that are designed to stack together makes the best use of space, helps with inventory, and keeps your food fresher than store packaging. Baskets help to corral similar items, provide a unified look, and can be pulled out to easily access their contents. The final step is to label the container with the name of its contents. A smaller additional label can be used on all products to keep track of the expiration date.\r\n\r\n## 15. Open Pantry Design Fit for a Chef\r\n\r\n![Open Pantry Design Fit for a Chef](/resources/images/15e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:gingerandthehuth.com\r\n\r\nPantry shelving ideas aren’t usually showpieces, but this one is, and it shows how an organized pantry can make a kitchen more efficient. Just look at this and imagine gathering what you need to prepare a meal. The first step is considering what you want included in your pantry, such as the Kegorator and the coffee bar. Then you have to decide if you are hiring a builder or building it yourself. Measuring, drawing your plans, and calculating materials and costs should be done carefully so that building your pantry goes smoothly. Of course, you could add doors, but who wants to do that when the pantry is this gorgeous.\r\n\r\n## 16. Grouping Products in Your Pantry\r\n\r\n![Grouping Products in Your Pantry](/resources/images/16e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:thegoldprojectblog.com\r\n\r\nPlanning on how you will group products in your pantry should actually be the first step in your pantry design project. Baking products, spices, and paper products are obvious, but for easier mornings, consider keeping breakfast products together. Studying what you keep in your pantry, how the products relate to each other, and how and when you use them will help you decide what containers you need, what sizes you need, and how many of each container you need. Then, you’re ready to shop for containers while keeping the cost down. Your pantry organization ideas don’t have to cost a lot. The final key to success is to label containers so that your family knows what goes where.\r\n\r\n## 17. Farmhouse-style, Custom-made, Tiny Home Free-standing Pantry\r\n\r\n![Farmhouse-style, Custom-made, Tiny Home Free-standing Pantry](/resources/images/17e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:homestead-honey.com\r\n\r\nPantry shelving ideas can have style and not be expensive. In addition, they can hold a lot of items and still be compact. This pantry shelving unit looks like a bookcase, but it was built to hold inexpensive quart canning jars and gallon jars. To conserve space, the eight shelves are just 1/2 inch taller than the jars they are meant to hold. If the space available in your home is not that wide, then the pantry shelving unit could be made taller but not as wide. The wood used to make the pantry was beautifully hand finished.\r\n\r\n## 18. Custom Cabinets for a Transformed Closet Pantry\r\n\r\n![Custom Cabinets for a Transformed Closet Pantry](/resources/images/18e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:diydesignfanatic.com\r\n\r\nStudying a closet that you are going to convert to a pantry could give you some custom pantry shelving ideas. The closet that was going to be converted was wide enough to actually create a double shelf unit. So, instead of making the cupboards stationary and built-in, the bottom cupboard on one side became a rolling cart so that it and its contents could be rolled out and used in the kitchen. The bottom half on the other side includes a coffee station and a convenient outlet was installed. This turned an under-utilized closet into a very functional extension of the kitchen.\r\n\r\n## 19. Odd Space to Country Pantry Storage Idea\r\n\r\n![Odd Space to Country Pantry Storage Idea](/resources/images/19c-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:welivedhappilyeverafter.com\r\n\r\nSometimes older homes may have odd open nooks offering space that can be put to a number of uses. If you have such a space near your kitchen, you could add a wall, install shelves, and design your own pantry. You can have floor to ceiling shelves. You could install a counter and outlets for some of your appliances. You can enclose the space behind a door or leave it open to create a focal point. You could build in a desk and bookcase shelves where you can look through your cookbooks, look at recipes online, plan your menus, and write out your grocery list. Dream up the pantry with the features that will work best for you, and then create it.\r\n\r\n## 20. Remodeled Pantry Shelving Ideas\r\n\r\n![Remodeled Pantry Shelving Ideas](/resources/images/20e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:manhattan-nest.com\r\n\r\nIf you have an older home that has been remodeled multiple times, you might find some odd spaces that you could convert into a pantry. In this case, a staircase had been relocated as part of one past remodeling project. Two closets were built where the staircase had been. To create this pantry, the wall between the closets was demolished, creating the long, narrow space for the pantry. The narrow shelves along the length of the space keep smaller items visible and accessible while the wider shelving at the end provides room for larger items like the microwave, cereal boxes, cookbooks, and other larger items. The drawer under the counter for the microwave keeps cleaning supplies out of sight.\r\n\r\n## 21. Cute and Organized Kitchen Pantry Ideas\r\n\r\n![Cute and Organized Kitchen Pantry Ideas](/resources/images/21e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:whitelanedecor.com\r\n\r\nJust because a pantry is a utilitarian room doesn’t mean it has to be dull. You could use wall decals with any motif that suits you from pantry and kitchen related designs like fruit, vegetables, pasta, or coffee mugs to fanciful flowers, butterflies, and rainbows to a large, stick-on wall mural that might feature a café, an urban street scene, a garden, or a country meadow. If you don’t have a fixture for a ceiling light, you can have an electrician install the wiring. Then you can add a pendant light that enhances your pantry’s theme. Attach battery operated LED lights to the bottom of some shelves for more illumination.\r\n\r\n## 22. Large Modern French Pantry Shelving Ideas\r\n\r\nThis larger pantry carries the décor used throughout the home into the storage area. The pantry contains counter space that could be used for food preparation or to store appliances. Outlets allow you to use small appliances in the pantry. Below the counter, large cubby holes, some with L-shaped shelves that go around a corner offer storage space for large items. Other cubby holes have adjustable shelves. Above the counter, the shelves go up to the ceiling, so you have places to store frequently used items as well as less used items. A ceiling light illuminates the space.\r\n\r\n## 23. Rustic Small Closet Pantry Design Idea\r\n\r\n![Rustic Small Closet Pantry Design Idea](/resources/images/23e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:birgitkerr.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nYou can have a pantry even if all you have is a 2 1/2 x 3 1/2 foot coat closet. One set of shelves go across the back for tall items. Adjustable shelves on the right in front of the other shelves make use of that vertical space. Hanging shelves on the door turn more vertical space into storage area. Tall see-through containers with a small foot print hold items that come in bulky bags. Pull out drawers hold small packaged items like mixes and seasonings. Labeled wood crates hold items that you might want to pull out to use together. Finally, a Lazy Susan on each shelf keeps canned goods and other items accessible. A tiered Lazy Susan could make greater use of vertical space.\r\n\r\n## 24. Tuxedo-Look Kitchen Pantry Ideas\r\n\r\n![Tuxedo-Look Kitchen Pantry Ideas](/resources/images/24e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSource:momendeavors.com\r\n\r\nThis pantry storage idea carries the tuxedo look of the kitchen décor into the pantry. Chalkboard paint on the exterior of the pantry door turns it into a family message board. The alternating black and white storage baskets feature chalkboard labels that allow you to find and lift out all the things you need in each category at one time For example, one basket contains all of the snacks for a family snack fest and another all of the things for packing school lunches. Placing canned foods on a plastic coated wire shelf leaves storage space for small items underneath while, again, a multi-tiered rack keeps other canned goods easily accessible.\r\n\r\n## 24 Fresh Pantry Shelving Ideas to Organize Your Cooking Thyme\r\n\r\nAmong these pantries are ideas for keeping your pantry inventory easily accessible when you want to use it as well as highly visible when you want to know what supplies are low for your grocery list.

Though there are differently-sized compartments, we love that they are not necessarily tailored to specific objects or uses.\r\n\r\nThe overall look of the product is also stunning with a black matte finish that will match with many modern or minimalist designs. Unlike other desk organizers currently available, this product also has rubber feet to help reduce movement and prevent any scratching.\r\n\r\n## 26. Simple and White Desk Organizer\r\n\r\n![Simple and White Desk Organizer](/resources/images/26-best-office-desk-storage-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’re in the market for a desk organizer, it’s likely that you’ve already resigned yourself to finding something that is either entirely black or made with a mesh-oriented design. Though the aforementioned products are helpful, they often don’t have the same type of elegance that someone with a preference for lighter colors could actually use. This is why we appreciate that this Victor white desk organizer uses a white coat of paint that will pair much better with vibrant colors. The drawers also have a transparent layer of glass in-between them, something that gives off an elegant touch!\r\n\r\n## 27.

For some, a home office is just a place to do work that was not able to be done during work hours, leading them to not spend as much money on the process of renovating their home office. If you just need a small desk organizer that gets the job done, this is a perfect option that has space for your phone, business cards and even pencils!\r\n\r\n## 28. Stackable and Plastic Organizer Boxes\r\n\r\n![Stackable and Plastic Organizer Boxes](/resources/images/28-best-office-desk-storage-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice desk and storage ideas typically take on the form of desks or desk organizers, but they don’t necessarily have to be either of those categories of product. These plastic organizer boxes function like Tupperware for food, allowing you to compactly pack bits and pieces of various accessories for storage. Something that we love about these products is that they are so versatile and can also be used to take parts of work with you on-the-go!\r\n\r\n## 29.

They might be a little more creative than the ones typically displayed in home and garden magazines, but that just meansyour space will be unique.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things to consider when thinking about organization in a tiny bathroom. Are you taking advantage of the entire space? Are you hanging, hooking, shelving and stacking things both horizontally and vertically? Can you do something more efficiently? For example, instead of folding your towels, can you roll them? Is your design actually functional? Will you use it? Will your kids use it? It’s pointless to install clever shelves and hooks if they’ll be ignored by your family.\r\n\r\nIf this sounds like a lot to think about, don’t worry. We’ve already done the work for you when it comes to finding and curating small bathroom storage ideas. Here are just a few ways to re-organize your towels and toiletries during your next round of spring cleaning.\r\n\r\n## 1.

Since burpees involve explosive plyometric movement, they\'ll get your heart pumping too.\n\n**How to do burpees: **Stand with your feet shoulder-distance apart and send your hips back as you lower your body toward the ground in a low squat. Then, place your hands right outside of your feet and hop your feet back, allowing your chest to touch the floor. Push your hands against the floor to lift your body up into a plank and then jump your feet just outside of your hands.

While it is slightly complicated, she says that the total-body conditioning move is seriously effective for blasting belly fat.\n\n**How to do a Turkish get-up: **Holding one kettlebell by the handle with both hands, lie on your side in a fetal position. Roll onto your back and press the kettlebell up toward the ceiling with both hands until the weight is stable on one loaded side. Release your free arm and free leg to a 45-degree angle with your palm facing down. Slide the heel of the loaded side closer to your butt to firmly grip the floor.\n\nPushing through the foot on the floor, punch the kettlebell up with the loaded arm and roll onto your free forearm. Don\'t shrug your shoulder toward your ear with the supporting side. Be sure to keep your chest wide open. Straighten the elbow on the ground and lift yourself up to a seated position. Weave your front leg through to the back. To protect your knees, your shin on the back leg should be perpendicular to your shin on the front leg.\n\nPerfectly align your arms: wrist over elbow, shoulder over elbow over wrist. Raise your torso to make your upper body erect. Swivel your back knee so that your back shin is parallel with your front shin. Get a grip on the floor with your back toes, then take a deep breath, and stand up.\n\n4Medicine Ball Burpees\n\n![Focussed on her workout](/resources/images/focussed-on-her-workout-royalty-free-image-508126435-1543356195.jpg)\n\nPIXDELUXEGETTY IMAGES\n\nPhelps suggests adding amedicine ball to your burpee to increase the intensity of the exercise and boost yourmetabolism—all while building a sleek set of six-pack abs.\n\n**How to do medicine ball burpees: **Standing with your feet shoulder-distance apart, hold a medicine ball with both hands. Extend the ball up overhead, then slam the ball down on the ground as hard as you can, hinging over and sitting your butt back as you slam. As you hinge over, bend your knees. Place your hands on the ground outside of your feet and jump back into a high-plank position. Keep your body in a straight line. Then, jump your feet back towards the outsides of your hands so that you are squatting. Pick up the ball and press it overhead, extending your body and standing tall.\n\n5Sprawls\n\n![A beautiful muscular girl in tights and a vest makes a warm-up at the stadium. gym, fitness, healthy lifestyle](/resources/images/beautiful-muscular-girl-in-tights-and-a-vest-makes-royalty-free-image-1568757238.jpg)\n\nVADIARGETTY IMAGES\n\nThe sprawl is basically a burpee on steroids—a full body exercise that works as many muscles as possible and burns calories while shaping and toning upper- and lower-body, especially your abs. “It takes the traditional burpee to the next level by having you touch your chest to the ground, then push-up to plank as you continue the move,” explains Braganza.****\n\n**How to do a sprawl: **Standing with your feet shoulder-distance apart, squat down and place your hands on the ground. Jump your feet back to a plank and lower your body to touch the ground. Push yourself up to a plank and then jump your feet outside of your hands into a squat. Stand back up. That’s one rep. “If you want to burn even more calories, add a jump between each sprawl,” Braganza adds.\n\n6Side-to-Side Medicine Ball Slams\n\n![Confident young woman exercising with medicine ball](/resources/images/confident-young-woman-exercising-with-medicine-ball-royalty-free-image-867945298-1543356724.jpg)\n\nSOUTH_AGENCYGETTY IMAGES\n\n“Medicine ball slams are a dynamic, explosive, and highly metabolic exercise that does not simply target one muscle group,” explains Chris DiVecchio, trainer and founder ofPremier Body & Mind. On the surface, the obliques, hamstrings, quads, biceps, and shoulders are the primary movers of this exercise. “But as time goes on and fatigue sets in, nearly every other muscle in the body, in one way or another, may become involved as a secondary mover which makes this a total gut blaster,” he adds. Doing side-to-side ball slams versus overhead slams incorporates more oblique ab work.\n\n**How to do lateral medicine ball slams: **Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart with the medicine ball on one side. Pick up the ball and simply rotate your body as you slam the ball a few inches away from your pinky toe. Make sure to pivot your feet and bend the back knee as you come into a split squat position to catch the ball on one bounce. Alternate sides. Make sure you tighten your core as you bring the ball overhead and to the side.\n\n7Overhead Medicine Ball Slams\n\n![Young attractive woman exercising with medicine ball](/resources/images/young-attractive-woman-exercising-with-medicine-royalty-free-image-1568752737.jpg)\n\nOLEKSANDR BRIAGINGETTY IMAGES\n\nOverhead medicine ball slams strengthen your core as it works against gravity. This exercise also tests your endurance, getting your heart rate up each time you pick the ball up and bring it overhead. To get the most out of this exercise, be sure to use a heavy weighted ball.\n\n**How to do overhead medicine ball slams: **Standing tall with your feet hip-width apart, hold a medicine ball with both hands. Reach both arms overhead, fully extending your body. Slam the ball forward and down toward the ground. Extend your arms toward the ground as you slam and don’t be afraid to bend your knees as you hinge over. Squat to pick the ball up and then stand back up.\n\n8Russian Twists\n\n![Determined woman exercising with medicine ball on gym floor](/resources/images/determined-woman-exercising-with-medicine-ball-on-royalty-free-image-1568753444.jpg)\n\nNEUSTOCKIMAGESGETTY IMAGES\n\nThe Russian twist is a core exercise that improves oblique strength and definition, explains DiVecchio. The move, typically performed with a medicine ball or plate, involves rotating your torso from side to side while holding a sit-up position with your feet off the ground.\n\n**How to do Russian twists: ******Sit up tall on the floor with your knees bent and feet off the ground. Hold a medicine ball with your hands at chest height. Lean backward with a long, tall spine, holding your torso at a 45-degree angle and keeping your arms a few inches away from your chest. From here, turn your torso to the right, pause and squeeze your right oblique muscles, then turn your torso to the left and pause to squeeze your left oblique muscles. The movement should come from your ribs and not your arms.\n\n9BOSU Ball Planks\n\n![Fit brunette using bosu ball in plank position](/resources/images/fit-brunette-using-bosu-ball-in-plank-position-royalty-free-image-1568754089.jpg)\n\nWAVEBREAKMEDIAGETTY IMAGES\n\nYou know that your cardio sessions are crucial when it comes to burning the layer of fat sitting on top of your abdominal muscles. But it\'s still important to work those abs even as you\'re trying to shed fat, says New York City-based personal trainer Adam Sanford, founder ofAdam Sanford Fitness. His favorite move to do that? Holding plank on aBOSU ball.\n\nIt\'s more challenging than a normal plank where your hands are on the floor, because the BOSU tests your balance, says Sanford. \"When your body tries to find control as your balance is challenged, your abs, obliques, and deep transverse abdominal muscles are activated,\" he says. Strengthening these core muscles also helps increase yourmetabolism, ultimately helping you to burn more calories and fat.\n\n**How to do BOSU ball planks: **Flip a BOSU ball on its rubber side and hold onto the edges of the flat surface with both hands, about shoulder-distance apart. Hold the plank for 30 to 45 seconds, increasing the time as you get stronger.****\n\n10Running On an Incline\n\n![Low Section Of Woman Running On Treadmill In Gym](/resources/images/low-section-of-woman-running-on-treadmill-in-gym-royalty-free-image-1568753803.jpg)\n\nSUMETEE THEESUNGNERN / EYEEMGETTY IMAGES\n\nRunning at an incline rather than on a flat surface has been shown to increase total calorie burn by as much as 50 percent, saysJill Penfold, a Los Angeles-based personal trainer. Whether you\'re outside on a hill or at the gym on an inclined treadmill, start outwalking for five to 10 minutes, suggests Penfold. \"Your heart rate should elevate pretty quickly as you pick up your pace,\" she says.\n\n**Try this treadmill workout: **Walk or jog on an incline for five to 10 minutes. ****Maintain a jog for another five to 10 minutes, then pick your pace up again and start running. \"This doesn\'t have to be an all-out sprint,\" says Penfold, but you should be working hard enough that you can\'t carry a conversation. Spend five minutes running, then drop your pace back down to a jog. Continue alternating with five to 10 minutes of jogging and five to 10 minutes of running for 30 to 45 minutes.\n\n11Rowing Machine\n\n![Woman using rowing machine at gym](/resources/images/woman-using-rowing-machine-at-gym-royalty-free-image-1568754439.jpg)\n\nCAIAIMAGE/PAUL BRADBURYGETTY IMAGES\n\nJust because you may not have access to open water, it doesn\'t mean you can\'t weave this fat-blasting cardio workout into your gym routine. Not only does using arowing machine get your heart rate way up, which helps you blast calories and burn fat, but it also works muscles in your legs, core, arms, shoulders, andback, says Penfold.\n\n**Try this 4-minute rowing circuit:** Begin with 20 seconds of rowing followed by 10 seconds of rest. Look at how many meters you traveled in that time. (Don\'t get off the rowing machine or even let go of the handle when you rest, says Penfold.) Repeat this eight times, trying to beat your distance each time. When you\'re finished with this four-minute circuit, row a fast 500 meters and note how long it takes you. \"That\'s the number you\'ll want to match or beat during your next rowing session,\" says Penfold.\n\n12HIIT\n\n![Woman practicing jump squats in park](/resources/images/woman-practicing-jump-squats-in-park-royalty-free-image-1568754936.jpg)\n\nCAVAN IMAGESGETTY IMAGES\n\nWhile the old thinking was thatsteady-state cardio sessions were best for burning fat, we now know that short and intense bursts of fast-paced cardio is much more effective. Hope Pedraza, an ACSM personal trainer and the creator ofinBalance, a San Antonio-based fitness and wellness studio, suggests doing intervals that alternate between exercises that work different muscle groups.\n\n**Try this HIIT workout:** After a 10-minute warm-up, spend 30 seconds doing as many reps as possible ofsquats,push-ups, kettlebell swings, or single-arm rows. Then, rest for 30 seconds and do a different exercise for another 30 seconds. Continue for 10 rounds. Choose any of your favorite exercises—just make sure you alternate between exercises that work different muscle groups, which will help certain muscles recover while you work others.\n\n13Strength Training\n\n![Fitness girl lifting dumbbell in the morning.](/resources/images/fitness-girl-lifting-dumbbell-in-the-morning-royalty-free-image-1568755537.jpg)\n\nBOJAN89GETTY IMAGES\n\nIf you\'ve beenlifting moderately heavy weights but are still looking to drop belly fat, it\'s time to pick up the intensity by using heavier weights and cutting down on rest time between reps, saysTyler Spraul, CSCS, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and the head trainer atExercise.com. \"Lifting heavy is where you see more an afterburn effect. Your body continues to burn calories even after you leave the gym,\" Spraul says. Just be sure that your technique doesn\'t suffer as you increase your weight, which can lead to injury. If you\'re new to strength training, this15-minute total-body workout is a great place to start.\n\n14Walking\n\n![Two African American women jogging together](/resources/images/two-african-american-women-jogging-together-royalty-free-image-1568755937.jpg)\n\nKALI9GETTY IMAGES\n\nYes, you read that right. Simplywalking can go a long way toward helping you shed belly fat, saysSahmura Gonzalez, a personal trainer based in New York City.\n\n\"It seems so simple, but 45 to 60 minutes of brisk walking every day can do wonders for your metabolism,\" says Gonzalez. \"Plus, it ensures that you don\'t over-train, which can lead to an over-production of cortisol—a stress hormone that\'s been shown to contribute to belly fat.\"\n\nIf yourwalking workout helps you unwind after a stressful day or work through emotions that might otherwise stress you out, there\'s a chance it\'ll help you lower cortisol levels, which in turn can keep belly fat in check, says Gonzalez. And brisk walking is an effective way to drop pounds—including the belly fat that\'s hiding your abdominal muscles. \"One hour of rapid walking a day can lead to one pound of fat loss a week,\" says Gonzalez.\n\n15Yoga\n\n![Yoga classes](/resources/images/yoga-classes-royalty-free-image-1568756287.jpg)\n\nYULKAPOPKOVAGETTY IMAGES\n\nGetting your Om on won’t burn as many calories as a hilly run or lifting weights, but it can help build muscle and improve your endurance, which are all crucial for boosting your metabolism.

How to Do a Proper Plank, According to a Personal Trainer', 'This total-body exercise strengthens more than just your core.', 'Whether you’re taking a group fitness class or following anexercise DVD at home, it’s a sure bet that you’ll be doing planks at some point during the workout—and for good reason. Planks are the ultimate test of total-body strength, not just your core. That’s why they’re the groundwork for manybodyweight exercises, likepush-ups and burpees.\n\n“The plank is one of those jack-of-all-trades exercises you can carry in your back pocket to strengthen not only your core, but also your chest,arms, back,legs, andbooty,” explains,Nicole Blades, as NASM-certified trainer at BodyRoc FitLab in Connecticut. “A plank with proper form can help improveyour posture, too. The best part is, this dynamic move doesn’t require any equipment. It’s a total bodyweight exercise.”\n\n## So what muscles do planks work, exactly?\n\nWhether you’re in a low or high plank, you’re balancing weight on your arms and toes. This targets a wide range of muscles, especially the rectus and transverse abdominis, Blades says. Therectus abdominis are the front muscles in the abdomen that support the muscles of the spine and help keep organs in the abdomen area in place. They’re known as the “six-pack muscles” because they give your abs shape and definition.\n\n## MORE FROM PREVENTION\n\nCold and Flu Remedies\n\nOn the other hand, the transverse abdominis (TVA) muscles are known as the “corseting muscles” because they cinch the waist and act as core stabilizers that support the low back. In fact, a weak TVA is often the culprit oflower back pain.\n\nTHE BEST PLANK EXERCISES\n\n![Leg, Arm, Physical fitness, Shoulder, Joint, Exercise, Knee, Stretching, Hip, Human body, ](/resources/images/plankjack-1547064653.jpg) \n\nHow to Do Plank Jacks to Tone Your Entire Body\n![woman doing ab exercise](/resources/images/screen-shot-2021-01-03-at-7-03-36-pm-1609725784.png)Lower-Ab Exercises to Set Your Core on Fire\n\n“Planks also target the trapezius and rhomboid muscles (upper back muscles) in your back, as well as the pectorals (chest) and serratus anterior (the serrated-shaped muscles that wrap around the side of your chest and shoulder),” Blades says.\n\nWhen you engage yourupper body muscles, you’re putting less pressure on your core and are able to hold a plank longer. You can further engage your shoulders andback muscles in a plank when you grip the floor more with your fingers and hands. Keeping a neutral spine will also help relieve pressure on your neck and make holding a plank less uncomfortable.\n\n### But core includes your hips and low back, too.\n\nWhen people think of their core, they tend to think only about their abs—but the powerhouse includes your hips and low back, too. “A solid plank works the quads (front of the thighs), glutes, and calf muscles in your lower half,” Blades says.\n\nIn fact, your hips play a big role in making your planks stronger. Your hips are connected to yourlower abs (aka the lower part of your rectus abdominis), so engaging these muscles will help you hold the position longer with proper form. When you squeeze your hips, you’re also able to brace your core more and keep your low back lifted—something that many fitness newbies tend to overlook.\n\n## How to do a proper plank\n\nThere are many different ways to achieve the perfect plank, but here’s a step-by-step breakdown on how to do a high plank.\n\n1. Get into a tabletop position with your shoulders directly over your wrists and hips in line with your knees.\n2. Engaging your abs, shoulders, back, and glutes, extend your legs back to straighten into a plank and hold.\n3. If you can, do the exercise in front of a mirror, to check that your butt isn’t raised. (A common mistake, but your body should be flat as opposed to an upside down-V shape.)\n\nFor a modified plank, Blades suggests dropping to your knees instead of holding yourself up on your toes. “Get on all fours and walk your hands forward so your body forms a slanted line from your head to knees, like you would in a modified push-up,” she says. To recruit the glutes and hamstrings, keep your feet lifted toward your butt. Once you master this variation, you can work your way up to a forearm plank by placing your forearms on the ground.\n\n## How long should you hold a plank?\n\nAim to hold a plank for 15 seconds, then work your way up to 30, 45, 60 seconds, and so on. Instead of watching the clock, Blades suggests setting a timer. This way you’re not painstakingly watching the seconds go by. Don’t forget to also use your breath, deeply inhaling and exhaling.\n\nBy focusing on your breath, you’ll be able to help set your mind at ease throughout the uncomfortableness\n\nThe best way to hold a plank longer? “Practice, practice, practice,” Blades says. “The more you do the exercise, the more strength and endurance you will build and the longer you will be able to hold it. If you feel like you’re about to quit, push yourself to stay in plank a few seconds more. You can do it!”', 0, '2021-03-09 19:52:29', '2021-03-10 12:03:03', '/resources/images/push-up-variations-1561686713.png', 'https://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/a28747774/muscles-planking-exercise/', 1, 0);

Other studies that have measured fitness have found that being fit has significant health benefits regardless of weight.*\n\n\n------\n\n“‘Fat but fit’ is a myth.” “Overweight and healthy is a big fat lie.”\n\nThose and other headlines rang out recently as mainstream news outlets picked up the latest study on BMI, physical activity, and risk of cardiovascular disease. The researchers’ goal in this study, which was published in the *European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, *was to examine the notion of whether one can be “fat but fit,” a debate that has raged in the medical community for more than 20 years. And the study concluded that a physically active lifestyle cannot protect your heart against the negative impact of being overweight.\n\nThis particular study pulled data from 527,662 adults from Spain, with an average age of 42, who were insured by an occupational risk prevention company. They were put into groups according to their weight, based on BMI, and their activity levels. About 42 percent of the participants were normal weight with a BMI of 20 to 24.9; 41 percent were overweight with a BMI of 25 to 29.9; and 18 percent were classified as obese with a BMI of 30 or above.\n\nActivity levels were based on the World Health Organization (WHO) physical activity guidelines, which recommend performing at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous activity (or some combination of the two) a week.\n\nPeople who said they didn’t exercise at all were considered inactive. Those who reported some activity, but didn’t meet the minimum WHO requirements, were considered insufficiently active. Those who met the WHO minimum levels were considered regularly active. Overall, 63.5 percent were inactive; 12.3 percent were insufficiently active, and 24.2 percent were regularly active.\n\nThen the researchers examined the participants’ cardiovascular risk factors by categorizing them for high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes, all of which raise the risk for heart attack and stroke.\n\nAfter crunching the data, the researchers found that being active was definitely healthier than not being active. Those who reported some physical activity were less likely to have any of the three risk factors compared to their completely sedentary peers. Those who were more active also had a lower risk of high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\nHowever, those who were in the overweight or obese categories were at a significantly higher risk for cardiovascular disease regardless if they were otherwise “regularly active.”\n\nThose who were regularly active but obese were twice as likely to have high cholesterol, five times as likely to have high blood pressure, and were four times more likely to have diabetes compared to the participants who were normal weight, but didn’t meet the minimum activity guidelines. Those in the overweight category also were at an increased risk despite their activity level, though the increases in cardiovascular risk were less dramatic.\n\nThere’s just one problem: this latest study didn’t actually measure fitness.\n\n## Cardiorespiratory fitness counts\n\nIt’s hard to describe individual fitness by the WHO guidelines alone. Walking the dog for 20 minutes (which is a perfectly great activity!) checks the box for meeting those requirements; so does doing short interval workouts every day. But a study that just looks at meeting the guidelines doesn’t give a clear picture of what people are actually doing; let alone how fit or not they are.\n\nIt’s also challenging to assert that you can’t be fit if you’re fat—anyone who is clinically defined as overweight, but has run marathons, can tell you that. In fact, research that investigates cardiorespiratory fitness specifically (not just whether or not you get the minimum amount of active minutes according to the guidelines) paints a different picture.\n\nSpecifically, a 2014 meta-analysis titled “Fatness vs. Fitness on All-Cause Mortality,” published in *Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases* investigated the impact of your cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by VO2 max, and your BMI on risk of death from any cause. It concluded that risk of death was dependent on your fitness levels, not your BMI.\n\nThat research concluded that people who were fit—whether they were normal weight, overweight, or obese—all had similar risks of dying from any cause. On the other hand, unfit people had twice the risk of dying of any cause regardless of their BMI.\n\n“Optimal body weight is different for each individual,” says exercise scientist Vaughn Barry, Ph.D., of Middle Tennessee State University who was the lead author of the 2014 *Fatness vs Fitness *study. “You could have a BMI higher than what the charts say is optimal and be running 18 miles a week and be healthy. Being fit removes and lowers a lot of health risks.”\n\nRecent research also shows that more exercise means more protection (a.k.a. exceeding the minimum requirements might be the ticket for some people). In a 2021 study of more than 90,000 people published in *PLOS Medicine, *researchers found that those who logged the most physical activity—measured as moderate-intensity, vigorous-intensity, or as total volume—had about a 60-percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease than those who logged minimal amounts of activity.\n\nOther research has found that for every 1 MET, or “metabolic equivalent,” increase in exercise capacity, the risk of early death from any cause decreases an average of 17 percent; that goes up to 25 percent for people who are categorized as obese. By the time you reach 7.5 METs of exercise capacity, risk of early death from any cause is similar to those of normal weight and those classified as obese, according to a study published in the *American Journal of Hypertension.*\n\nRunning a 12-minute mile is categorized as an 8 MET activity according to the scientific Adult Compendium of Physical Activities, which assigns MET intensities to nearly every physical activity.\n\nThat study concluded, “These findings suggest that it is more beneficial to be fit and overweight or obese rather than normal weight and unfit.”\n\n## Body composition matters\n\nThat’s not to say there aren’t inherent risks that are associated with high levels of body fat, particularly the kind that sits deep in your abdomen—that can cause inflammation in the body and is among the factors that can increase your risk for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. (It is also worth noting that BMI doesn’t tell you anything about body composition; nor does it accurately reflect whether athletes—who have high amounts of muscle—are actually “overweight.”)\n\nLosing body fat and increasing muscle can definitely improve health in some people, as can eating well, reducing stress, and getting quality sleep. In the big picture, though excess fat can pose health risks, you can still be fit, and yes, you can still be healthy. The most important thing is to keep moving and work with a health professional who will help you keep tabs on all the rest.\n\n“Fitness versus fatness has been an academic debate over the last 20 years,” Tim Church, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D., of Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University, one of the country’s leading physicians in exercise and obesity research, tells *Bicycling*. “What is not debatable is the power of movement at any weight. No matter your age, weight, or health conditions,regular physical activity promotes better health and general quality of life.”\n\n**Bottom line:** It’s clear that meeting the minimum WHO exercise guidelines was not especially protective for those in the higher BMI categories in this study. But the study doesn’t shut the door on the decades-long debate as some headlines suggest. One study can never do that. It also doesn’t conclude that you can’t be “fit and fat” or that “fitness” itself is not especially protective, as other studies have over the past 20 years.', 0, '2021-03-09 19:57:09', '2021-03-10 18:49:31', '/resources/images/close-up-of-athlete-using-smartwatch-royalty-free-image-1612966263.jpg', 'https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a35495183/fat-and-fit-study/', 0, 0);

In a new interview with *Women’s Health*, she revealed that time included *lots* of self-care.\r\n\r\nNow, she starts each day withmeditation, journaling, and deep breathing exercises. Then, she sweats it out. The mom of two saidPilates has been her go-to workout after undergoing a C-section in March. Nearly a year after baby Callum was born, Dewan is doing three or four one-hour ZoomPilates workouts a week.\r\n\r\n“It gets you fit so fast, and you just feel stronger.

It’s as if it’s the funniest thing that ever happened.”\r\n\r\nOf course, she still has to get creative with little ones running around. After Dewan had her first child, Everly, she’d rock her to sleep and simultaneously sneak in some exercise, she previously told InStyle. “So I’d be doing lunges across the room or squats or whatever I was doing, because I was going to be doing it for 40 minutes regardless, so I might as well turn it into a little bit of a workout. I think that it fully helped kind of snap things back in shape a little bit faster than they would have.”\r\n\r\nDewan also eats a vegetarian diet, following an 80/20 mindset with healthy picks and treats. She starts her day with a green smoothie, and for meals, she preps filling dishes loaded with fiber-rich options like quinoa, veggies, and beans.\r\n\r\nAt 40, Dewan said she feels better than ever as a mom of two. “I feel more grounded in my body,” she told WH. “I feel excited for this next decade and what is available to create.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nAs a part-Okinawan child growing up in South Carolina, it was hard to know my heritage when surrounded by churches and Chick-fil-As. So, every Saturday, my parents and I ate lunch at a Japanese restaurant, often followed by a trip to a two-room Japanese market nestled in the woods off the highway. My family all got something out of this; my dad picked up his favorite rice crackers with wasabi peas, my mom got mochi cakes, and I loaded the cart with chewybotan candies wrapped in edible rice paper, tiny boxes offruit-flavored gum balls,juicy jelly cups, and more. I loved that magical little market. While daily life seemed to tell me that I wasweird and different from my friends and everyone around me, those snacks showed me how special my identity was.\r\n\r\nIn college, I took Japanese for a year, and at the end my class traveled to Japan. There, the market aisles of my childhood exploded into a Willy Wonka–esque fever dream. There were shops and supermarkets *everywhere*, not to mention vending machines filled with treats anddrinks that looked and tasted like nothing I’d had before. Lavender ice cream, fizzy peach soda, ramen-flavored crackers, and many more tasty, textured snacks I can’t even describe because I’m not sure *what* they were. It was delightful, but then I flew back to the States, and that was that.\r\n\r\nUntil last year, that is, when I was sent a package fromBokksu, a Japanese snacksubscription service. I wasn’t sure what to expect but was delighted to find the box stuffed with goodies. The company thoughtfully included a pamphlet that explained the snacks, which was helpful since the names printed on their *kawaii* (cute), cartoon-illustrated wrappers were, of course, written totally in Japanese. The snacks ranged from savory (tiny pickled plum-flavored potato sticks, crunchy edamame crackers, roasted sesame-seed rounds) to sweet (a pear and cheese biscuit, handmade yuzu-sake hard candies, freeze-dried strawberries filled with chocolate, matcha chocolate stick cakes, and more). There was even a genmaicha brown rice green tea.\r\n\r\nUnlike a lot of similar subscription snack services that send snacks (like Pocky, say) that you can find in most Asian markets in the United States, Bokksu boxes are filled with curated snacks and tea pairings sourced directly from snack makers in Japan. \r\n\r\nThe founder, Danny Taing, studied Japanese in Japan and fell in love with the country’s *oishii* (delicious)foods, as I did. Working with artisans, his company only selects gourmet goodies that are the hardest to find outside Japan—i.e., when my mom tried to buy a candy from the box that she liked online, she couldn’t find it. Bokksu has a solution for that too. You can subscribe to a monthly box of surprise snacks, buy a one-off for yourself or as agift (forLunar New Year, maybe?), *or* you can shop for the individual items from their boxes on theBokksu Market. This is great in case you fall in love with anything (which you very well may).\r\n\r\nMy favorite aspect of the box was that there were a few samples of each of the 15 snacks, leaving enough for me to send my parents too. We were able to share them together over Zoom, reminding me of the Saturdays of my childhood, an experience that was especially meaningful in a time when we are far apart. We’ve always talked about traveling to Japan as a family, and though we can’t right now, Bokksu’s snacks were a whimsical, worthy substitute in the meantime.\r\n\r\n![Image may contain: Confectionery, Food, Sweets, Box, and First Aid](/resources/images/bokksu.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Bokksu Classic Gift Box (3-month subscription)', 0, '2021-03-09 20:10:59', '2021-03-10 19:25:17', '/resources/images/SELF_giftbox.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/bokksu-box-review', 1, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (43, 11, '6 Ways to Set Boundaries Around Food With Your Family', 'Because food and family are very intertwined.', '![6 Ways to Set Boundaries Around Food With Your Family](/resources/images/lobster_meal.jpeg)Chris Sorensen/Adobe Stock\r\n\r\nFor many families,food is the centerpiece of get-togethers. Cooking and eating are activities that bring people together to enjoy a shared experience. But in some cases, the experience can be triggering—especially if you have a complex relationship with food. If you find yourself walking away from mealtime with family feeling upset, anxious, resentful, or otherwise not so great, it may mean it’s time to set some boundaries around food.\r\n\r\n“Most people who are looking to set up some boundaries around food with their family are usually doing so because they’re trying to make some sort of a change for themselves,”Monica Kelly, L.C.S.W., in Round Rock, Texas, tells SELF. Whether they are seeking to improve their relationship with food or their body, or changing their diet for whatever reason, it can be hard to implement a food-related change when food traditions run deep.\r\n\r\nOne reason is because, for many families, food isn’t just food.\r\n\r\n“Food represents culture and history, and it can be a way that people build community, find comfort, and feel like they belong,”Mishay Butler-Ozore, LMFT, in Southern California, tells SELF. This can make for a messy situation when someone wants to break the mold. “Family members can feel like you’re rejecting them—like you’re not just resisting a food or recipe, but resisting generations and history,” Butler-Ozore says. “It can become very personal for some families.”\r\n\r\nSetting boundaries allows you to be open and honest about your needs. Ideally, it can keep you from feeling disrespected by your loved ones and harboring feelings of resentment and vice versa. And, if necessary, it can open the door to finding other, mutually enjoyable ways to connect and build your relationships, Butler-Ozore says.\r\n\r\nEven if yourfamily gatherings are limited (or nonexistent) right now, family tension probably isn’t going to magically go away (sorry). For some people, it may even be looming in their minds as an unwelcome part ofgetting back to “normal” life. Having a plan ahead of time can make it a lot easier—and get you looking forward to the next big family gathering, whenever that may be.\r\n\r\nHere’s how experts recommend setting boundaries around food that both you and your family members can feel good about.\r\n\r\n## 1. Do the internal work first.\r\n\r\n“The number one thing I tell clients is that you have to internally be clear about what your boundaries are and grant yourself permission to have those boundaries,”Danielle Locklear, LMFT, in Austin, tells SELF. “When we\'re not clear about our boundaries and have not internally reconciled them and given ourselves energetic permission to have them, that’s when we can sort of get bulldozed by people.”\r\n\r\nSimply put: If you want other people to accept and respect your boundaries, you have to accept and respect them first.\r\n\r\nSo how do you do that? Butler-Ozore suggests asking yourself some questions: What is the change you’re trying to make? Why do you want to make it? Why is it so important to you? Maybe it’s that you’d like toban certain body-related comments or diet talk from the dinner table, or maybe your boundary is related to a specific dietary change you’re making and you know your family is going to push back. Whatever it is, it’s important to define it in your mind first. “If you’re not sure why you even feel the way you do, it’s harder to set a boundary,” she says. You may end up setting a boundary based on what’s comfortable for everyone else, not based on what you need.\r\n\r\nGiving yourself this permission can be tricky. “A lot of people don\'t believe they have a right to set boundaries with family,” Butler-Ozore says. “You feel like you don\'t deserve to get what you need or that they don\'t care what you need, and those are the thoughts you have to fight before you even face family members.”\r\n\r\nOnce you are clear about what you need, remind yourself that you have a right to ask for it. You can respect your family and know that your needs are important at the same time, Butler-Ozore says.\r\n\r\n## 2. Plan out the conversation—and practice it.\r\n\r\nFirst, decide who you’re going to speak with. Maybe it’s the person who is saying or doing things that rub against the boundary you want to set. Maybe it’s a parent who you can get on board first so they can help wrangle the rest of the family.\r\n\r\nThen think abouthow you’re going to say it. Everyone’s family is different, so the language and tone you use with your family will differ from the one you use with other people, says Locklear. It’s worth spending some time thinking about how you communicate best with your family, and how they might react to what you have to say. For instance, the conversation may warrant a very serious or more lighthearted tone depending on what feels most natural with your family and what they generally respond to. It may also depend on whom specifically you’re speaking to.\r\n\r\n“There may be some folks who are like, ‘Okay, cool sounds good, I will do my best to honor that,’ and then there are other folks who will not respond in that way,” Kelly says. If you can anticipate their reaction, you’ll be more prepared for how to handle the whole conversation.\r\n\r\nOnce you figure out the language you’re going to use, write it down. Then say it out loud to yourself while looking in a mirror, Locklear suggests. “Things sound different in our heads than when we say them for the first time,” she says. “It could come out robotic or stuffy sounding, and for a lot of families and cultures, they\'re going to be thrown off.”\r\n\r\nThink about how you can put your request into your own words so that it feels right. And then get comfortable saying it out loud. Seriously, practice it a few times like you would a speech or presentation, so that your brain is used to it and comfortable with it by the time the actual conversation happens.\r\n\r\n## 3. Bring it up at a neutral time.\r\n\r\nLike any other potentially sensitive conversation, you want to bring up the boundary talk ideally in a neutral moment, Locklear says: “Families tend to have emotionally charged relationships. When doing something that might feel scary or new or breaking down a relational pattern, we want to do it in a neutral moment.”\r\n\r\nIn person is usually best, Locklear says, though bringing up over the phone or via email or text first may be helpful in some situations (or necessary thanks to the pandemic). “If you think someone may have a big reaction to your boundary,” she says, “it can be an act ofself-care to have that conversation over phone or email to allow them space to have said emotional response, and then revisit the discussion once they\'ve settled.”\r\n\r\nA phone call ahead of time can also help set a shared expectation, Locklear says. For example: “Yes, I would love to join you for a picnic, but just so you know, I’m not drinking this month so I won’t be able to have wine.” This can get everyone on the same page so that there are no surprises (if that’s something you think would be useful for someone in your family).\r\n\r\nMost Popular\r\n\r\n- ​\r\n\r\n  A Lower Body Dumbbell Workout to Fire Up Your Butt and Legs\r\n\r\n  By Christa Sgobba\r\n\r\n- ​\r\n\r\n  What Is ‘COVID Arm’?

If you can establish your boundary well in advance—say, a month before the holiday or gathering in question—it can give them time and space to have their reaction, Locklear says.\r\n\r\nUltimately, you’ll need to figure out what time or place or method your family will be most receptive to.\r\n\r\n## 4. Follow the DEARMAN tactic.\r\n\r\nButler-Ozore suggests using a technique from dialectical behavioral therapy that’s focused on effective interpersonal communication, known by the acronym DEARMAN. “It can help people learn how to ask for something that they want from others,” she says. Here’s what it stands for and how to use it:\r\n\r\n- Describe the situation. Stick to the facts. *“Dieting and weight come up often at the dinner table, and I’m not okay with it.”*\r\n- Express your feelings. *“I’m trying to develop**a healthier relationship with food**, and this sort of talk makes it very difficult for me to do that. It also makes me not want to attend family meals.”*\r\n- Assert what you would like to happen. *“I’d like if everyone could please stop talking about dieting and weight loss when we’re at the dinner table.”*\r\n- Reinforce why they should care. What’s the reward? *“This will help make me feel comfortable again at family meals, and give us an opportunity to talk about other things and really bond as a family.”*\r\n- Maintain, or stay mindful and focused on what you’re hoping to get out of the conversation: the boundary you set out to create in the first place.\r\n- Appear confident. Easier said than done, but remind yourself that you deserve to create and uphold boundaries for your own well-being.\r\n- Negotiate. Be willing to give a little in order to get. That doesn’t mean you need to give up your boundary or concede. It just means you might need to offer some creative solutions to their concerns that don’t require you to compromise on what ultimately makes you feel comfortable and respected. *“I’d be happy to come up with a conversation starter at the beginning of the meal so we can start to focus on other, more positive things when we are together.”*\r\n\r\nMost Popular\r\n\r\n- ​\r\n\r\n  A Lower Body Dumbbell Workout to Fire Up Your Butt and Legs\r\n\r\n  By Christa Sgobba\r\n\r\n- ​\r\n\r\n  What Is ‘COVID Arm’?

Only you can determine how much negotiating you’re willing to do before you undermine your own boundary. If you’ve offered alternative solutions and no longer have any suggestions that keep you within your boundary, it might be time to stop and recognize that the other person might just not be ready to respect your boundary right now (read on for more on that).\r\n\r\n## 5. Accept what you can control and what you can’t.\r\n\r\nSetting boundaries isn’t always going to go perfectly. Especially when they’re related to messy things like family and food. That’s okay.\r\n\r\n“When we set boundaries with anyone, there’s likely to be disappointment, especially if we’re breaking a relational dynamic we’ve had with that person over time,” Locklear says. “They might be disappointed, and it’s okay for people to get disappointed. That’s not your work to do, that’s theirs.”\r\n\r\nWhat she means by that is: It’s your responsibility to clearly communicate what you need, but the way other people react is not your responsibility.\r\n\r\nIt all comes back to honoring your needs andyour energy. “You can communicate your boundary and remind people when they are brushing up against it,” Locklear says, “but you don’t need to be available to keep defending yourself over and over again or energy use energy to keep explaining yourself if someone is not available to listen.” \r\n\r\n## 6. Decide when it’s time to move on.\r\n\r\nThis type of work can be really difficult, Kelly says. “It’s really difficult to divest from a system while living within that system, so it’s important to be careful with where your energy is.” Even after approaching this the best way possible, there still might be some people who don’t get it. It’s okay to reinforce your boundaries more firmly if they’re not understanding, Kelly says. It’s also okay to walk away from it if it’s costing you more energy than you can spare.\r\n\r\n“Be in tune with where you are and be patient and graceful with yourself when you can’t be as direct with boundaries,” she says. That might mean having to change some of your behaviors instead so that you can still honor your needs in whatever way you can. Maybe that means leaving the room when food conversations come up or taking a break from one specific person who is really not accepting or respecting your boundaries.\r\n\r\nMaybe that means not going to family events where food will be present. “As hard as that can be, the point is to get yourself into a place where you can be emotionally and mentally well to be around them,” Kelly says. It could also mean getting creative about how you do connect. Suggest a different activity that doesn’t center on a meal, like afamily game night.\r\n\r\nSetting boundaries is an important exercise in patience. “We can\'t just flip a switch and start a new familial pattern and expect there won’t be any opposition to it,” Locklear says. “We’re such an instant gratification culture, we want answers and quick fixes, and we find ourselves unwilling to stay in discomfort. But if people are really showing up for those hard, uncomfortable conversations, there’s really something beautiful on the other side of it.”', 0, '2021-03-09 20:11:48', '2021-03-10 19:26:59', '/resources/images/lobster_meal.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/setting-boundaries-around-food', 1, 0);

', '![How Much Protein Do You Need in a Day](/resources/images/protein_food.jpeg)Nadine Greeff/Adobe Stock\r\n\r\nEven if you’re not exactly sure what protein is technically—or how much protein you need—odds are that you do know how good it makes you feel. Whether you like to start your day with a fillingegg scramble, chug the nutrient in shake form after a workout, or cook up a nice steak (or piece oftofu) for dinner, you’re likely familiar with the lasting satisfaction that you get from protein in its many delicious variations. And, as we’ll talk about, protein certainly does enough to earn its reliably good reputation.\r\n\r\nWhile you know protein is a great thing to have, you might also have a few questions. Like, why exactly does your body need it? How *much* protein do you need to eat, and when should you eat it? And how does your activity level factor into that? Here’s a rundown of what protein does and how much of the nutrient your body needs.\r\n\r\n## What protein actually is\r\n\r\nProtein is one of the three macronutrients (i.e. nutrients the body needs in sizable amounts). Unlike carbs and fat, protein is not usually a major energy source, although we definitely get some of that from it—protein provides four calories per gram. But protein is often referred to as a building block in the body because of its central role in growth and development.\r\n\r\nAlmost all animal-derived products—meat, poultry, eggs, dairy, fish—contain a significant amount of protein, so they get labeled as protein sources when we’re talking about our diets and nutrition. Butprotein is also present in a lot of plant-based foods. There’s a good amount in beans, peas, nuts, and seeds, for instance, while vegetables and grains generally contain smaller amounts, according to theU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Whole grains will have more protein than refined grains, though, which are missing the part of the grain that often supplies a lot of the protein content, asSELF previously reported.\r\n\r\nProteins are made of small units called amino acids. There are 20 different amino acids in total, which can be broken down into two main groups, per theFDA. Nine of the 20 are what are referred to as *essential* amino acids, meaning that the body is unable to produce them itself and so we must get them from food. The other 11 are *nonessential* because the body is able to synthesize them out of the essential amino acids or the normal process of breaking down proteins, according to theU.S. National Library of Medicine.\r\n\r\nNow when a protein is a good source of all nine of the essential amino acids, we call it a complete protein, according to theFDA. All animal products are complete proteins, and so is soy. When a protein is missing or pretty low in any of those essential amino acids, it’s considered incomplete. Most plant foods are considered incomplete proteins.\r\n\r\nThe good news for vegetarians, vegans, and lovers of plant foods in general is that you can still easily get all the essential amino acids from eating a wide variety of incomplete proteins. As theFDA explains, incomplete proteins are often just lacking in one or two amino acids, so they can often make up for whatever the other one is lacking. For instance, grains are low in an amino acid called lysine, while beans and nuts are low in methionine. But when you eat, say, beans and rice or wheat toast with nut butter, you’re getting all the amino acids that you do when you eat, say, chicken. While people used to be encouraged to eat foods in combinations at meals, we now know this is not necessary, according to theU.S. National Library of Medicine, as long as you’re eating a variety of complementary incomplete proteins throughout the day.\r\n\r\n## Why we even need protein\r\n\r\nThat building block nickname is no exaggeration. The stuff is an integral component of every cell in your body, including, yes, your muscles.\r\n\r\nWATCH\r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\n“If we don\'t get enough protein, our bodies actually won’t be able to rebuild properly and we’ll start to lose muscle mass,”Colleen Tewksbury, Ph.D., M.P.H., R.D., senior research investigator and bariatric program manager at Penn Medicine and president of the Pennsylvania Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nProtein helps repair the microtears that occur in your muscle fibers when they’re strained during exercise, theAmerican College of Exercise (ACE) explains. That process of damage and repair is what maintains and grows your muscle mass.\r\n\r\nBut protein is not just important for people who work out: In addition to muscle growth and repair, protein is essential to the growth and repair of virtually *all* cells and body tissues—from your skin, hair, and nails to your bones, organs, and bodily fluids, according to theFDA. That’s why it’s especially important to get enough of it during developmental periods like childhood and adolescence.\r\n\r\nProtein also plays a role in crucial bodily functions like blood clotting, immune system response, vision, fluid balance, and the production of various enzymes and hormones, per theFDA. And because it contains calories, it can provide the body energy for storage or use. (But this definitely isn’t its main gig, which we’ll get into in a bit.)\r\n\r\n## What happens in your body when you eat protein\r\n\r\nIt’s not like you eat a piece of chicken and that protein goes directly to your biceps. Dietary protein gets broken down and reassembled into the various kinds of proteins that exist in the body. No matter what kind of protein you’re eating—plant or animal, complete or incomplete—your body’s first objective is to break it back down into all the different amino acid units it was assembled from, Dr. Tewksbury explains, through the digestive process.\r\n\r\nThen those little singular amino acids get reconfigured (by the liver) into whatever kind of protein your body needs. For instance, some proteins in the body make up antibodies that help the immune system fight bacteria and viruses. Others help with DNA synthesis, chemical reactions, or transporting other molecules, theNational Institute of General Medical Sciences explains.\r\n\r\nSince your body can’t store excess protein, it will break down any protein it doesn’t need right away and usually stow it away in fat tissue (as triglycerides), according toMerck Manuals. Rarely, if your body is in a fasting state or not getting enough calories coming in from other macronutrients, broken-down protein can be converted into glucose and used for emergency fuel,Whitney Linsenmeyer, Ph.D., R.D., nutrition and dietetics instructor in the Doisy College of Health Sciences at Saint Louis University and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, tells SELF. But this is not typical, because the body prefers carbs as its primary source of energy (followed by dietary fat, if the body isnot getting enough carbs). “We *can* adapt to use protein for energy as well, but it’s not ideal,” Dr. Linsenmeyer says. “Ideally, [our bodies] want to leave it alone to build and maintain body tissues.”\r\n\r\n## How much protein your body needs\r\n\r\nOkay, so how much protein are we talking about here? The amount of protein your body actually requires for the purpose of tissue growth and repair is determined by factors like sex, age, height, weight, health, activity level, and overall calorie need, according to theU.S. National Library of Medicine. So it’s going to vary a lot from person to person.\r\n\r\nA good starting point for roughly estimating minimum protein needs is therecommended daily allowance (RDA) for protein, or the average minimum daily intake that’s sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements (i.e. prevent a deficiency) for most healthy individuals (who are sedentary or minimally active). The RDA for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, or about 0.36 grams per pound. (So you would multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36 to get your RDA.) For instance, the average 200-pound person needs at least 72 grams of protein per day to meet the RDA.\r\n\r\nPeople with a higher activity level will likely need more. Individuals who work out and want to maintain and/or build muscle mass through diet and exercise definitely benefit from getting more protein than the RDA,Adam M. Gonzalez, Ph.D., C.S.C.S., assistant professor in the Department of Health Professions at Hofstra University,has told SELF.\r\n\r\nHow much more, exactly, depends on factors like how much you exercise and your body composition goals, asSELF has reported—as well as who you ask. Several large organizations—theAcademy of Nutrition and Dietetics (Academy), Dietitians of Canada (DC), and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)01802-X/fulltext)—reviewed the research on sports nutrition and agreed that the optimal daily protein intake for active adults and athletes is 1.2 to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight (or 0.5 to 0.9 grams of protein per pound). Similarly, theInternational Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) recommends 1.4 to 2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (or 0.6 to 0.9 grams of protein per pound) for most individuals who are working out.\r\n\r\nBased on those recommendations, for instance, a 200-pound person would want to get between 100 and 180 grams of protein a day. Generally, the more active you are—the more frequent, strenuous, and long your workouts are—the higher in that range you’ll be, Dr. Gonzalez says.\r\n\r\n## How you should space out your protein intake\r\n\r\nWhen you eat your protein is just as important as how much you eat. It’s not about simply loading up after exercising or at one meal and skimping on it for the rest of the day. Like we mentioned, the body doesn’t have a protein holding tank like it does for carbs, where it can siphon away extras for quick access when we need it.\r\n\r\nThat’s why the best way to get your protein is split up throughout the day. Eating a good amount of protein at different points in the day helps your body direct protein where it’s needed, when it’s needed—not to mention, keeps you feeling satisfied and energized. So take a look at your daily amount (the recommendations above), and see how you can break that up in your various meals throughout the day.\r\n\r\nSpacing out protein intake is also super important for active individuals. That’s because muscle repair and growth are “greater when you consume adequate protein at breakfast, lunch, and dinner,” Dr. Linsenmeyer explains. Yes, “protein is vital after a workout,”Yasi Ansari, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D., national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and assistant director of Performance Nutrition for UC Berkeley Athletics, haspreviously told SELF. “But it is important for people to know that more [all at once] is not necessarily better.”\r\n\r\nYour muscles are going to be hungrier for protein for at least 24 hours after exercising, Dr. Gonzalez says—so basically, most of the time, if you work out most days. The Academy/DC/ACSM recommend getting 15 to 25 grams of protein (or 0.25 to 0.3 grams per kilogram of body weight) about every three to five hours to maximize muscle repair. The ISSN suggests getting 20 to 40 grams (or 0.25 grams per kilogram of body weight) every three hours or so. So a good target combining those ranges is 20 to 30 grams of protein at a time, asSELF has explained. If you want to get a bit more precise, convert your body weight in pounds to kilograms (divide your weight in pounds by 2.2), and multiply that number by 0.25 or 0.3. So for a 200-pound person, for instance, that works out to 23 to 27 grams of protein.\r\n\r\nYou want a similar amount after working out, too, when your muscles need immediate repair. How much protein your muscles can take in after exercising depends on things like the type and intensity of your workout and your body composition, Ansari explains—so lifting weights for an hour, for example, will make your muscles thirstier for protein than a 30-minute cardio workout. In general, though, theAcademy/DC/ACSM01802-X/fulltext) recommend getting that same protein hit (15 to 25 grams of protein, or 0.25 to 0.3 grams per kilogram of body weight) within two hours of exercising in order to maximize muscle repair, while the ISSN again recommends aiming for 20 to 40 grams (or 0.25 grams per kilogram of body weight).\r\n\r\nThe bottom line on protein? This nutrient is vital to our bodies, so you want to get at least the recommended minimum no matter what. If you work out, get a good bit more than that. And instead of loading up at one meal, spread the protein love throughout your day.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:13:15', '2021-03-10 19:26:59', '/resources/images/protein_food.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/what-protein-does-in-your-body', 1, 0);

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nIf you recently glanced around yourkitchen and decided you need something new: Welcome! Allow me to talk at length about the Ninja Foodi 5-in-1 Indoor Grill. It air-fries,bakes, dehydrates, roasts, and grills. Does my studio apartment kitchen corner need all of this? Yes, it does.\r\n\r\nLike so many other people, I was in the market for a standard air fryer and couldn’t decide what I needed. People kept telling me I should get one, but they couldn’t tell me why. I eventually realized thatair fryers serve up evenly crisp dishes fast and with less oil than deep frying. But after poring over things like voltage and size, I wasn’t sure that I’d make the most of one. I haven’t cooked meat in over two years—would I get bored with French fries and crispy cauliflowerair fryer recipes? That I’d have more than an air fryer is what made the Ninja Foodi 5-in-1 Indoor Grill ($210,Amazon) so appealing. I figured more features would increase my odds of using it regularly.\r\n\r\nThe appliance features a removable four-quart air fryer basket that nests inside a larger basin where you can roast, bake, or dehydrate to your heart’s content. There’s also an attachment that sits atop the basin and allows you to grill food indoors (up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit), achieving a char grill flavor without turning your kitchen into a cloud of smoke. All of these features are controlled by an easy-to-use digital interface.\r\n\r\nThe more than12,000 mostly glowing Amazon reviews, many of which noted that you can grill indoors with “minimal smoke” involved, eventually won me over. It turns out the reviewers were right. This five-in-one appliance is well worth the price tag. I’ve found that it replaces my toaster, I pan-fry food less often, and grilling indoorveggies has become a real treat. If grilling and air frying are high on your priority list, then I’d say you should go for it.\r\n\r\nI haven’t used the dehydration feature, but one reviewer remarked that smaller batches work best. And many reviewers commented that the roasting feature makes for tender chicken and other meat dishes. Some reviewers say they’ve baked cakes with the appliance, and—given the easy digital interface and size—I don’t see why this wouldn’t be true (if you’re interested, there areYouTube tutorials to help).\r\n\r\nCleanup is also relatively easy, requiring just a grill brush or Brillo pad, but fair warning that it’s not the most compact unit or the quietest. If you’re a person who makes midnight meals, the Ninja Foodi 5-in-1 Indoor Grill is significantly louder than amicrowave, FYI.\r\n\r\nUltimately, during a year when I’ve made some regrettable purchases (hello, pizza stone), the Ninja Foodi 5-in-1 Indoor Grill is still a major win. While I haven’t baked a cake or made dried apple slices just yet, knowing that I can is half the fun.\r\n\r\n![product image](/resources/images/ninja_foodi.png)\r\n\r\n## Ninja Foodi 5-in-1 Indoor Electric Countertop Grill\r\n\r\nYou can bake, roast, air fry, dehydrate, and grill with this versatile indoor appliance.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:14:09', '2021-03-10 19:28:15', '/resources/images/SELF_favninja.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/ninja-foodi-5-in-1-indoor-grill', 0, 0);

Add to that the regular seasonal toxic messaging—the post-holiday diet talk, or the pressure to “get in shape” for spring and summer—and you have a perfect storm for disordered thoughts and eating behaviors.\r\n\r\nFacing a gamut of triggers and unable to rely on their usual support mechanisms, many individuals may find themselves grappling with a sense of feeling out of control around food. For some, this might surface as a compulsion to overeat oreat emotionally; for others, it can be an urge to binge on certain foods. These impulses can manifest in serious mental health conditions like bulimia or binge eating disorder, though not everyone who experiences these urges will meet the diagnostic criteria for a specific eating disorder.\r\n\r\nThere are tons of reasons for why you may be feeling out of control around food—and there’s likely not one simple trigger that’s responsible for it.\r\n\r\n“This could be the result of biology, emotions, or the environment—and most likely, a combination of several of these factors,”Marian Tanofsky-Kraff, Ph.D., a professor of medical and clinical psychology at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences who researches eating disorders, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nBecause there are such varied causes, there’s also not one singular way to help thwart that out-of-control feeling. As someone whostarted recovering from bulimia seven years ago, I can tell you that multiple strategies are often necessary. Here are six actionable, expert-backed tips that may help if you’re struggling with food-related anxiety or, in particular, that unnerving feeling of being out of control when it comes to what you eat.\r\n\r\n## 1. Do your best to eat regularly.\r\n\r\nSkipping meals or restricting food can be a reason some people tend to feel a loss of control around food. So a key way to combat this feeling—though this can be much easier said than done—is to eat sufficiently so that you’re satiated and not constantly thinking about hunger.\r\n\r\n“Eating regularly is a big piece of overcoming out-of-control eating,”Saniha H. Makhzoumi, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist in Maryland who specializes in the treatment of eating disorders, tells SELF. “When we aren\'t eating enough or we avoid certain foods, we begin to feel deprived. In response to this, our bodies seek out food, especially ones that we told ourselves were off-limits.”\r\n\r\nSo Dr. Makhzoumi recommends trying to eat regularly. For some people that could look like three meals a day plus a snack when you’re hungry. But remember, this is super individualized, and a “regular” eating schedule is likely going to look different for each person. What’s more important than a set number of meals or snacks is to make sure you’re eating enough throughout the day so that you’re not experiencing frequent hunger pangs. Dr. Makhzoumi also takes an “all-foods-fit” approach in her practice, advising her clients to consume everything in moderation (barring any medical/religious restrictions).\r\n\r\n“If we allow ourselves to eat the foods that we crave, we can move on with our day rather than becoming preoccupied with that food,” Dr. Makhzoumi says. This is similar tointuitive eating, an approach whereby people don’t intentionally try to control their eating and instead focus on tuning into their senses of hunger and satisfaction.\r\n\r\nOf course, eating regularly can be a difficult task for someone who does feel out of control around food or who has had issues with eating before. In those cases, resources like the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA)helpline, or meeting with an eating disorder treatment counselor, can be helpful as you navigate that.\r\n\r\nAs I moved through the earlier part of my recovery journey, I gradually moved to an intuitive-eating framework. I eat when I’m hungry and stop when I’m full, and I give myself permission to have what I desire. I’ve learned to build trust around food by responding to what my body needs and wants rather than relying on external rules to guide my choices.\r\n\r\n## 2. Challenge and rephrase negative food talk.\r\n\r\nReframing unhelpful thoughts and beliefs is a crucial step toward food freedom. This often entails letting go of rigid rules about what, when, and how much we should eat, which fuel feelings of powerlessness around food.\r\n\r\nDiet rules are usually difficult to maintain, says Dr. Makhzoumi, so when we eat something we demonize, we can feel like a failure. This leads to an all-or-nothing mindset: “We figure, ‘I broke this rule, I might as well keep going and start again fresh tomorrow,’” says Dr. Makhzoumi. As a result, many people find themselves vacillating between eating to the point of discomfort and restricting.\r\n\r\nI’m mindful of the language that surrounds eating, whether it’s the self-deprecating self-talk looping inside my head or the negative food andbody talk in conversations with others. While I predominantly make what I consider to be“healthy” food choices, I refuse to label certain foods as “good,” “bad,” and “off-limits.” In turn, mealtimes are no longer the emotional battlefield they once were.\r\n\r\nOne way to approach this reframing is through cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), an evidence-based intervention that’s highly effective for rooting out negative thought patterns and formulating a healthier perspective. It involves examining the validity of our unhelpful cognitions (e.g., “I ate badly yesterday,” “I shouldn’t be eating this dessert,” or “I can only have a salad for dinner”), then reevaluating them and coming up with more balanced alternative beliefs (e.g., “There’s nothing wrong with indulging in something I enjoy,” or “I don’t need to compensate for past meals”).\r\n\r\nWhile many people receive CBT with a therapist (more on that below), I’ve benefited from usingself-help books to practice it on my own (one of my favorites is*Overcoming Bulimia Nervosa and Binge-Eating*). There are also many tutorials available online by licensed mental health professionals, including on YouTube, where you can learn and understand the concepts of CBT and how to apply them to your life. Practicing CBT tactics a few times a month is like getting the oil in my car changed regularly: It makes it easier for me to notice and manage the undercurrent of emotions in day-to-day life before they cross over into unwanted behaviors.\r\n\r\n## 3. Address your emotions directly.\r\n\r\nAnother reason a person may feel out of control around food is due to challenging emotions like stress or sadness, says Dr. Makhzoumi. Many of us have learned to use eating as a way to manage our feelings. That’s why it can help to give ourselves a moment to pause and self-reflect so that we can work to unravel the root cause of our emotions rather than turn to food as a way to numb or escape them.\r\n\r\nWhilestudies have shown that comfort eating isn’t necessarily a bad thing andcan serve as a valid coping mechanism, it’s also important to develop alternative ways to regulate our emotions. Again, this is an instance when a therapist can come in to help you understand and deal with the underlying stressors in your life in a more sustainable way.\r\n\r\nBut there are things you can do on your own too. Dr. Makhzoumi recommendsjournaling as a form of self-monitoring, namely recording and tracking when you feel out of control and the behaviors associated with it. This can promote awareness and accountability, as well as pinpoint possible triggers and patterns in how we feel and behave. Things to record might include how you felt, what you ate, where you were, and what was going on at that particular time. By tapping into your feelings and emotions—a process known as emotional regulation—you can give them time and space rather than pushing them down (here aresome tips to use this technique effectively).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the years I’ve used a variety of therapeutic tools.Meditation has helped create space for thoughts to feel less urgent and intrusive. Journaling and art have been consistently cathartic, allowing me to step back and process my emotions and experiences in a more objective and compassionate way.\r\n\r\n## 4. Do something you find pleasurable.\r\n\r\nWe often turn to food as a source of pleasure, especially if we’ve been restricting our dietary intake,Melissa I. Klein, Ph.D., an assistant professor of psychology at Weill Cornell Medical College who specializes in eating disorders, tells SELF. There’s nothing inherently wrong with eating recreationally or occasionally using food as a pick-me-up. In fact, joy, joyful connection, and other positive emotions can be acentral part of forming a healthy relationship with food. However, if you think eating for pleasure is one reason you feel out of control around food, it may be helpful to develop alternative sources of pleasure and ways of responding to emotions like boredom or frustration.\r\n\r\nEngaging in an alternate activity can shift your focus away from food, says Dr. Klein. It can be helpful to have some intentional distractions up your sleeve to interrupt and relieve overwhelming thoughts and emotions.\r\n\r\nThese can be activities such as playing an instrument,taking a bath, or creating art. Eventually, you might be able to turn to these kinds of activities for comfort or pleasure in moments when you would have felt out of control while looking to food for those feelings instead.\r\n\r\n## 5. Seek out expert help.\r\n\r\nA caveat to bear in mind is that people feel out of control around food for a wide spectrum of reasons, which is why a one-size-fits-all approach is unrealistic. With that in mind, it’s important to consult with an expert, if possible, to determine the underlying causes for *why* you’re feeling out of control. That could be a physical health expert, a mental health expert, or both.\r\n\r\n“For someone whose eating is driven primarily by physiology,” says Dr. Tanofsky-Kraff, “suggesting behavior changes and activities can be not only highly frustrating but stigmatizing, which can further promote out-of-control eating, mood disorders, and physical health problems associated with stress.”\r\n\r\nIf you really don’t know why you’re feeling out of control around food, if it feels more physical than mental, or if it’s a sudden change for you, it may be helpful to see your primary care doctor to rule out physical causes. For example, conditions like diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and hyperthyroidism can cause significant increases in appetite.\r\n\r\nFinding a therapist can be intimidating if you don’t know where to start, but there arelots of resources online to offer guidance. You can also ask your doctor for a referral to a therapist who specializes in eating-related issues, and they may be able to recommend someone who’s covered by the same insurance or know about financial assistance programs that can provide support. (Thesetips on how to find the best therapist for you can also help too.)\r\n\r\nDue to theCOVID-19 crisis, there’s also an influx of therapy platforms that can offer more affordable and flexible counseling services online. A few options includeBetterHelp andTalkspace. Before using an online company, though, do some research to ensure that the service you want to try carries out its practices ethically andwill protect your privacy.\r\n\r\n## 6. Talk to someone about how you’re feeling.\r\n\r\nWhile seeking out the services of a professional therapist can undoubtedly be helpful, it might not be an option for everyone. There are varioussystemic barriers that prevent people from receiving the mental health care that they need.Some cannot afford therapy or lack the insurance to pay for it, while others may have trouble finding culturally competent therapists.\r\n\r\nBut opening up about our thoughts and emotions can be incredibly nurturing (while yep, also daunting). My disorder was often at its worst when I cut myself off from friends and family, as isolation served as fertile ground for feelings of “out of control–ness” to fester and snowball. Positive social support has been shown to promote eating disorder recovery, says Dr. Tanofsky-Kraff. Even the simple act of calling a friend and having a conversation in those moments when you feel overwhelmed might help de-escalate distressing thoughts and lighten your emotional load.\r\n\r\nAnd with the dawn of telehealth, there’s now an abundance of free or low-cost alternatives to traditional therapy that allow people to reach out and share what they’re going through rather than tackle these issues alone (again, make sure you are vetting these spaces beforehand). This includes virtual peer support chat rooms likeSupportiv andHealthfulChat, and clinician-led support groups for people with eating disorders, some of which can be found via theNEDA andEating Disorder Hope websites. These platforms give users the opportunity to be heard, validated, and emotionally supported by one another. (Still,these groups can vary greatly in practice, structure, and the credentials of those running them, which is something to keep in mind before trying one out.)\r\n\r\nThere are also numerous 12-step programs with online support group meetings that are dedicated to helping people with issues around food, includingOvereaters Anonymous,Eating Disorders Anonymous, andAnorexics and Bulimics Anonymous. These programs use an abstinence-based model in an effort to guide individuals on a journey toward healing their relationships with food and their body. Even if you don’t choose to follow the 12-steps (they aren’t for everyone), it’s possible to attend a meeting if you’re feeling particularly unsettled around food and want to connect and be part of a supportive community.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to remember that disordered eating and the thoughts that accompany it are deeply complex. You may explore different coping strategies before you find one that resonates with you. Be kind to yourself. If you’ve had a long history of dysfunctional eating and adhering to food rules, it can take some time to repair a fraught relationship with food. But it’s possible in many cases to learn to become attuned to your body and its natural signals again, and gradually feel more empowered with your eating.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:14:52', '2021-03-10 19:28:52', '/resources/images/thinking_woman.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/tips-when-feeling-out-of-control-around-food', 0, 0);

Food Stying by Drew Aichele. Prop Styling by Campbell Pearson.\r\n\r\n*Welcome to**Grocery Diaries**, a new series that illustrates just how varied and personalized “healthy eating” really is. So many factors impact the choices we make at the grocery store, including access and affordability, health conditions, our individual cultural backgrounds, even what simply makes us (and our taste buds) happy. So we asked people across the country to share their grocery lists with us, and then called up a few of them to ask for more details. Why do they buy what they buy? How much do they spend? Who are they shopping for? What health conditions or nutritional concerns are they thinking about when they choose, for instance, almond milk over cow’s milk, or particular flavors or spices or treats? In this Grocery Diaries installment, we hear from a Boston registered dietitian who makes plant-based versions of her favorite Jamaican foods.*\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n**Name:** Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes\r\n**Age:** 38\r\n**Occupation:** Registered dietitian\r\n**Location:** Boston\r\n**Race/Gender:** Black woman\r\n**Health conditions/dietary restrictions to consider:** Avoids dairy, meat, and gluten. Additionally, Sue-Ellen is a member of the Seventh-Day Adventist World Church and refrains from eating pork, crustaceans, and gelatin as many followers do.\r\n**Grocery shopping frequency:** Shops for four people three times a month\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes was tired of searching for fresh callaloo ingrocery stores, so she grew her own. “There’s a big difference between fresh and canned. The canned is okay—and I’ll eat it—but I just really love the fresh,” she tells SELF. Callaloo is a green leafy vegetable similar to kale and collard greens that is popular in Jamaica, where Sue-Ellen is from. Sue-Ellen occasionally buys canned callaloo, but nothing beats eating freshly picked greens from her garden, she says.\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen moved to the U.S. from Jamaica when she was in elementary school. Her family lived in New Jersey before settling down in Florida, where they found many of the same fresh foods they ate back home, like callaloo and ackee, a West African fruit commonly eaten in the Caribbean. Now Sue-Ellen drives about an hour from her home to downtown Boston in order to find ingredients for her favorite Jamaican dishes, since many items are not available in her neighborhood markets.\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen follows aplant-based diet because she experienced stomach pains and uncomfortable bloating whenever she ate meat—as well as dairy and gluten, so she now avoids those types of foods. Occasionally Sue-Ellen cooks chicken and fish for her husband, Michael, and her two kids, Elizabeth and Malachi, but the whole family enjoys her meat-free meals. “I cook all my traditional meals the exact same way, but I take the meat out if I’m making them for myself,” she explains. “Eating traditional foods brings up memories from home.” Grocery shopping for those foods isn’t always easy, but Sue-Ellen manages to honor her traditions. Here are 10 items she picks up in a typical grocery trip.\r\n\r\n1.Linstead Market Jamaica Callaloo: $21.99\r\n\r\nAs we mentioned, Sue-Ellen grew up eating fresh callaloo, which is hard to find in the Boston area. She buys canned callaloo when she needs to, but thetaste just isn’t the same, she says. “I like my callaloo with a little more crunch and a little less salt,” she explains. Now Sue-Ellen grows callaloo in the summer and freezes it to last through winter. She cooks it with tomatoes, peppers, and onions, to serve alongside many of her meals.\r\n\r\n2. Cristobal Salted Cod Chunks: $7.99\r\n\r\n“Sunday dinner is really big where I was born in Jamaica,” Sue-Ellen explains. She starts the day by makingackee and salt fish for breakfast. “Ackee and salt fish is our national dish in Jamaica,” she explains. (Sue-Ellen eats ackee and jackfruit to stick with her meat-free diet. “Jackfruit looks similar to salt fish when it’s broken up in pieces,” she says.) Her daughter, Elizabeth, is particularly fond of the meal and begs, “Mommy, give me dumplings and salt fish. I want to be Jamaican.” Sue-Ellen says she laughs and responds, “You are. You’re Jamerican.”\r\n\r\n3.Spur Tree Jamaican Ackee in Brine: $10.10\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen misses picking fresh ackee from the trees in Jamaica and also in Florida where her father-in-law grows his own fruit. “You can tell the difference between canned and fresh ackee for sure, but that doesn’t hinder me from eating it,” she says. In addition to preparing ackee with salt fish andjackfruit, Sue-Ellen sometimes serves it with tofu.\r\n\r\n4. Yellow Yams: $2.29\r\n\r\n“In Jamaica, we roast yellow yams over an open flame,” Sue-Ellen says. That’s not something she can do in her house now, so sheboils or bakes them instead. Sue-Ellen especially likes how the sweetness complements some spicier flavors. “It goes well with curry chickpeas. It’s like a comfort meal,” she says.\r\n\r\n5. Green Bananas: $1.49\r\n\r\nWhen eating green bananas, “it feels like I’m home again,” Sue-Ellen says. Her absolute favorite thing about green bananas is thenostalgia that comes with eating them. “My mom used to mash the green bananas and put butter on them. I remember eating that, and it tasted so good.” And they go well with nearly any meal because they taste similar to potatoes, according to Sue-Ellen.\r\n\r\n![Image may contain Fruit Plant Food Apple and Meal](/resources/images/medium11162020-SELF-CHELSEA-KYLE-1283%252520copy.jpg)\r\n\r\nChelsea Kyle. Food Stying by Drew Aichele. Prop Styling by Campbell Pearson.\r\n\r\n6. 365 Whole Foods Market Organic Mango Chunks: $6.99\r\n\r\n“I grew up eating mangoes off the tree,” Sue-Ellen says. “Some people in Jamaica eat two or three mangoes in a row. We just sit there and eat them like a meal.” Now Sue-Ellen mainly buys them frozen touse in smoothies. “Smoothies just taste so much yummier with mango,” she says.\r\n\r\n7. Plantains: $.66\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen is thankful that these are readily available in her neighborhood grocery stores. “I eat plantains at almost every single meal. I love them and they’re just a familiar food,” she says. She serves baked or boiled plantains withscrambled tofu, in her sandwiches, or on top of her salad bowls.\r\n\r\n8. Nasoya Organic Tofu Super Firm: $3.99\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen’s family loves crispy tofu, and she has two secrets to making it perfectly: buying super -firm tofu and using theright cookware. “I feel like a cast-iron pot is really helpful in making it crispy,” she says. She prepares tofu using a variety of seasonings, like grilled jerk tofu (her son’s favorite).\r\n\r\n9. The Jackfruit Company Curry Jackfruit: $5.99\r\n\r\nOne of the best things aboutjackfruit is that it’s so versatile, according to Sue-Ellen. “As long as you season it well, jackfruit takes on the flavor of your spices—just like tofu,” she says. Sue-Ellen particularly likes using this brand on busy days because it comes preseasoned in the pouch.\r\n\r\n10.Blue Mountain Country Jamaican Curry Powder: $11\r\n\r\n“I can just list so many ways of using curry,” Sue-Ellen proclaims, including curry lentils, curry soup, curry chickpeas, and yellow curry rice. Although these recipes run the gamut, Blue Mountain curry powder is a staple in all of them. “This is made with truly authentic ingredients. It’s the real stuff,” sye says.\r\n\r\n*All products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (48, 11, 'What Are Antioxidants, and How Much of Them Should You Be Eating?', 'They’re easier to take in than you may think.', '![What Are Antioxidants and How Much Should You Eat for Your Health](https://media.self.com/photos/602ff9bf9370edfeeecead74/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/food_fruits.jpeg)Jesse Morrow/Adobe Stock\n\nThere are tons of buzzwords in the nutrition field, and “antioxidants” is definitely one of them. But what are antioxidants really, and how do they affect your body?\n\nFrom ketchup to pomegranate juice, plenty of foods are known for containing antioxidants. You’ve probably heard those compounds can do a lot for your health—they’ve been touted as doing everything from preventing heart disease to cancer—but are they as helpful as people say they are?\n\nLike many things in the nutrition field, there’s a lot to unpack regarding antioxidants. And, despite marketing claims singing their praises, they’re not exactly a panacea on your dinner plate. That doesn’t mean you should discount them, though: Antioxidants can bring a bunch of benefits with them.\n\nFrom how exactly they work to how you should be taking them in (and how much), here’s what you need to know about antioxidants.\n\n## What are antioxidants?\n\nBefore talking about what an antioxidant is, it helps to understand what we mean by another wellness buzzword: “free radical.” Free radicals refer to any molecule in your body that contains an unpaired electron, which makes them very unstable and keeps them looking for other compounds to bind to. Free radicals can serve some important functions in the body, such as signaling between cells, but because they are so reactive, they can also cause damage to cells through a process called oxidative stress.\n\nYour body generates free radicals during activities like digestion and vigorous exercise, and in response to things like UV light exposure, pollution, smoking, and certain diseases, Chwan-Li (Leslie) Shen, Ph.D., associate dean for research at Texas Tech University Health Sciences, tells SELF. It’s when free radicals are produced in excess that they can become problematic.\n\nAntioxidants, on the other hand, can help keep these free radicals in check. Antioxidants are compounds—either made in your body or consumed from external sources—that help neutralize free radicals and other molecules in your body that can damage cells and tissues, Mahdi Garelnabi, Ph.D., an associate professor of biomedical and nutrition sciences at the University of Massachusetts-Lowell, tells SELF. They do this through a variety of mechanisms, such as by lending an electron to a free radical to make it less reactive or by binding to a substance in a way that prevents further reactions.\n\nBy stabilizing these free radicals, antioxidants can also help your immune system function more efficiently and mitigate chronic inflammation, which is thought to be a driving force for many health problems, like cardiovascular disease and cancer. Antioxidants may also, through separate mechanisms, help repair DNA and cell membranes.\n\n## Where can you find antioxidants?\n\nYour body makes some antioxidants on its own, but sometimes that’s not enough. “A lot of times, your body generates too many free radicals, and your body cannot handle it, so external antioxidant intake is important,” Dr. Shen says.\n\nThere are thousands of antioxidants, and they are not only present in highly hyped “superfoods.” You can find antioxidants in a broad range of foods—like fruits, vegetables, seafood, whole grains, and meats—as well as in supplement form.\n\nSome antioxidants are essential vitamins that your body needs to function, while others are essential minerals. Examples of antioxidant vitamins include vitamin C (found in brussels sprouts, red cabbage, and peppers), vitamin E (found in almonds, sunflower seeds, and olive oil), and vitamin A, which your body makes from beta carotene (found in collard greens, sweet potatoes, and cantaloupe). Examples of antioxidant minerals include selenium (found in Brazil nuts, pork, and turkey) and zinc (found in oysters, beef, and pumpkin seeds).\n\nThen there are antioxidants that aren’t exactly considered essential nutrients, but still have effects on cells and tissues, Bradley Bolling, Ph.D., an assistant professor of food science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, tells SELF. You can find these in plant, animal, and other dietary sources.\n\nA few examples of these antioxidants include carotenoid cousins of beta carotene such as lycopene (found in watermelon, tomato sauce, and ketchup) and lutein and zeaxanthin (found in spinach, Romaine lettuce, and Swiss chard), chlorogenic acid (found in coffee, apples, and eggplants), flavonoids (found in berries, tea, and citrus fruits), and ergothioneine (found in mushrooms). Many of these non-essential antioxidants are being studied for their potential effects on optimizing health, preventing chronic disease, promoting longevity, and reducing inflammation, says Dr. Bolling. “There are varying grades of evidence for the effectiveness of these non-nutritive antioxidants,” he says.\n\n## How does eating antioxidants affect your body?\n\nAs a whole, antioxidants can be helpful because they fight back against the aforementioned issue of oxidative stress, which is linked to a wide swath of health problems. Cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and other metabolic diseases are just a few examples, says Dr. Garelnabi.\n\nOf course, a multitude of factors determine your risk of developing various diseases—oxidative stress being just one of them. Research does point to a broad range of health benefits in people who consume more antioxidants, but the National Institutes of Health notes that it’s possible the benefits of antioxidant-rich diets may have to do with a combination of substances in the food—or even other related lifestyle or dietary factors—rather than the antioxidants themselves.\n\n“Eating antioxidant-rich food is not only targeting one disease, but sometimes systemically helping the body to get a balance,” says Dr. Shen.\n\nLet’s take a look at the research showing a link between high antioxidant intake and reduced risk of disease. In one study published in the *European Journal of Nutrition*, researchers classified 23,595 Americans into four groups based on their antioxidant consumption. People who ate the most antioxidants had a 21% lower risk of dying over a 13-year period than people who ate the least, even as the researchers accounted for relevant mitigating factors such as participants’ age, sex, and economic status. (It’s worth noting, though, that this study was based on a 24-hour dietary recall, or people’s recollections of just one day of eating. Plus, as we mentioned above, the benefits may also have to do with other substances in the food, which can’t be measured here.) \n\nAccording to a meta-analysis published in *Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology* of 19 previously published studies that included over 700,000 people, a diet high in antioxidants may reduce the risk of cancer, with significant reductions seen with colorectal, endometrial, and gastric in particular. Research also indicates that high amounts of dietary antioxidants may influence your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and stroke.\n\nSo getting a good amount of antioxidants in your diet is generally considered to be good for your health. But because different antioxidants can have different effects within the body, it’s worth talking to your health care provider about your specific health history and risk factors, as well as the role that certain antioxidants may have on your health. For instance, higher intake of flavonoids has long been linked with a reduced risk of heart disease, and a recent study in the *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* suggests an association with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease too. If you’re concerned about a particular condition, talk to your health care provider about whether you should focus on eating more of any one particular thing—especially if you feel like your diet is unbalanced in any way.\n\nAll that said, dietary antioxidants are no substitute for medical treatment, and getting a balanced diet is always more beneficial than relying on any one nutrient. It’s worth noting that much of the research we’ve covered so far looked at total antioxidant intake, and what researchers found were correlations—not cause-and-effect relationships. While there’s plenty of research pointing to a link between higher antioxidant intake and lower risk of disease, we can’t say with certainty that loading up on any one antioxidant will change your health in specific ways. It’s about balance and variety, which we’ll explain in a bit.\n\n## How should you work antioxidants into your diet?\n\nFor the antioxidants that fall into the essential nutrient category, recommended daily allowances (RDAs) exist to help you plan your intake. For selenium, the RDA is 55 micrograms per day. For zinc and vitamins A, C, and E, you can find RDAs for your age and sex in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. (For instance, women 31–50 should shoot for 8 mg of zinc, 700 micrograms of vitamin A, 15 mg of vitamin E, and 75 mg of vitamin C.) Some of these essential nutrients, like vitamin C and vitamin A, are listed on food labels, so it’s easy to tally up how much you’re getting.\n\nThere\'s no standard recommended amount to consume for the antioxidants that aren’t essential nutrients; researchers are still determining them, says Dr. Bolling. You won’t see the dose of those antioxidants listed on the label of foods containing them, either.\n\nSo rather than trying to hit a specific amount of these, you can instead look to add more foods that contain antioxidants into your diet. “Just having berries for breakfast or eating citrus or drinking green tea is enough to put people into the higher level of patterns of consumption,” says Dr. Bolling.\n\nThe best way to enrich your diet with antioxidants is to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables (the U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend two and a half cups of vegetables and two cups of fruits per day), says Dr. Garelnabi. Nuts, whole grains, dark chocolate, and tea are also good antioxidant sources, as are lean meats and seafood, says Dr. Shen.\n\nDiversity is also important in your diet, since some antioxidants work better together, says Dr. Garelnabi. To make sure you’re getting a variety, try to include different colors on your plate, since the color of fruits and vegetables can serve as a clue to their antioxidant content, suggests a study published in *Current Research in Food Science**.* For example, reddish foods like apples, strawberries, sour cherries, red cabbage, and red peppers tend to be rich in a type of flavonoid called anthocyanins, while orange and yellow produce like mangos, yellow peppers, oranges, bananas, and nectarines are good sources of vitamin C.\n\nSo what about supplements? Loading up on antioxidants in the form of supplements doesn’t actually bring you any greater benefits. In fact, a 2014 review of the research stated “there is no evidence to support the use of antioxidant supplements in the primary prevention of chronic diseases or mortality.” In fact, there is some evidence that they may even be harmful, especially in high doses.\n\nEating a balanced diet for most people means you’re likely getting enough antioxidants and don’t need to take antioxidant supplements, says Dr. Garelnabi. However, some people *may* benefit from adding supplements, especially if they can’t tolerate or need to avoid certain foods. Just talk with your doctor before taking any supplements to determine whether you really need them and whether they could interact with any medications you take.\n\nOtherwise, if you’re focusing on a variety in your diet, and are making it a point to try new fruits or veggies to broaden what you’re taking in, you’re likely doing just fine on the antioxidant front. To really sharpen those benefits, though, you may want to pair your balanced plate with a workout routine: Exercise—as long as you aren’t overtraining—may even help boost your body’s production of natural antioxidants, says Dr. Garelnabi.\n\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:16:28', '2021-03-10 19:30:24', '/resources/images/food_fruits.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/what-are-antioxidants', 0, 0);

Lots of times, these are foods that play a big part in not only our families, but in our larger culture too.\n\n“Eating cultural foods can take us back to a comforting experience, which has a sentimental or nostalgic value,” Samina Kalloo, R.D.N., C.D.N, a registered dietitian based in New York, tells SELF. “Food has the power to connect us back to simpler times.”\n\nBut there’s a flip side benefit: Trying foods you may not be familiar with from *other* cultures can also be a really special way for you to respectfully learn about and experience them, which can give you a greater understanding of these cultures in more of a firsthand, active way. As another plus, trying different foods from other cultures can also help expand your palate, which is especially helpful if you’ve been in a food rut.\n\nDifferent cultures tend to use different ingredients—including fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices—and different preparation techniques, which bring unique bursts of flavor and texture to dishes that you may not be familiar with otherwise, explains Gina DeLuca, R.D., C.D.N., registered dietitian at Perlmutter Cancer Center at NYU Langone Hospital–Long Island.\n\nChances are pretty good that you have a few favorite cultural foods of your own, which you may turn to when you need a little pick-me-up. But if you want to broaden your tastes and try something new (or hear someone sing the praises of a food you already love), check out these 18 registered dietitians’ favorite dishes from their cultures.\n\n## 1. Horiatiki Salad\n\n“I grew up eating Greek food, and one thing I could eat every day is a Greek salad, also called a horiatiki salad. It contains simple, fresh ingredients that include tomato, sliced cucumber, green pepper, sliced red onion, Kalamata olives, and of course, feta cheese, and is dressed with extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper. When using high-quality olive oil with the remaining fresh ingredients, the flavors pop.\n\nI was introduced to it daily at the dinner table, particularly in the summertime when the ingredients were grown fresh from our garden. I eat it with fresh bread—sometimes pita bread—alongside my main entrée, which is usually lean poultry or fresh fish. Sometimes I eat it with just bread as my main course and it leaves me perfectly satisfied.” —Sarah Galanis, M.P.H., C.D.N., director of food and nutrition at NYU Langone Hospital–Brooklyn\n\n## 2. Eggplant Parmigiana\n\n“My favorite cultural food is—hands down—eggplant parmigiana, which is essentially a casserole of lightly breaded, fried eggplant slices layered with tomato marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese. It’s best if the eggplant is crisp, and the cheese cooked well-done or slightly burned. Toss in some fresh basil, and you’re set. The commingling of flavors is simply superb.\n\nMy mom would make it as a dish classic to our Italian culture. There’s a process of steps involved in it, for instance, ‘sweating’ the eggplant, which means slicing it into disks, lightly salting them, and placing them on and between paper towels to draw out the solanine—the ingredient that gives eggplant its initial bitter taste. It can be eaten for dinner, but leftovers reheat well for lunch, and I’ve also been known to eat leftovers for breakfast when there was nothing else I wanted. When I was pregnant with my son, my husband laughed at my open-mindedness to food possibilities—like eggplant parmigiana for breakfast.\n\nI adore that this dish can be modified in so many ways. You can make it classic style by frying the eggplant slices, but you can also grill or roast them to opt for a more heart-healthy option; you can change up your types of sauce or cheese; you can even use zucchini in place of eggplant if you have an eggplant allergy, or use dairy-free cheese and gluten-free bread crumbs if you have additional food allergies or intolerances. The possibilities are endless.” —DeLuca\n\n## 3. Goulash\n\n“I come from many cultures (English, Irish, Hungarian, but mostly Slovenian), so it was always fun watching my mom cook from very different cultures. My dad was not very adventurous, so looking back, we often had heartier Hungarian-type foods like goulash. The goulash my mom made was a saucy mix of beef, vegetables, and caraway seeds—she would often put them over buttered noodles. Sunday afternoons, my grandparents would come over and we would eat all together. My mom would often make this dish since everyone seemed to like it—and quite frankly, trying to cook for a crowd can be very expensive, and this was budget-friendly. My 98-year-old grandfather asked for it on his deathbed, so it was good enough to leave a lasting impression!\n\nI think it’s one of my favorite dishes because it does remind me of the dinners we had when I was little. Now when I make this dish, I often will substitute the beef for venison, just as a personal preference that doesn’t change the taste of it. Although you can often tweak a recipe to make it healthier, the base of the dish should remain the same and should be passed on to loved ones to keep the tradition going.” —Beth A. Czerwony, R.D., registered dietitian with Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition\n\n## 4. Sweet and Savory Sweet Potatoes\n\n“Sweet potatoes are a root vegetable that are prepared multiple ways in my African American culture. Sweet potatoes—specifically baked sweet potatoes—are sweet and savory, and I eat them as a side with my dinner. I simply bake them in the oven at 400°F for 30 to 40 minutes, and once done, I top with cinnamon, mash with a fork, and enjoy. Baking sweet potatoes in the oven gives them an amazing texture and brings out their sweet flavor.\n\nSweet potatoes come in many forms at holiday events: baked, whipped, in a pie, or topped with marshmallows. And you’re considered a top chef in my culture if you can make the best sweet potato pie or dish. It’s a badge of honor to prepare sweet potato dishes—only a few family members are trusted to bring sweet potato pie and candied yams or sweet potatoes to holiday gatherings. Also, a sweet potato recipe is passed down through generations. Each family has their own twist.” —Nijya Saffo, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.\n\n## 5. Arroz con Gandules\n\n“My ultimate favorite dish is arroz con gandules, a famous Puerto Rican Rice dish with a small type of legume. I have been eating this dish since I was a toddler—even now, everywhere we go, we are welcomed with a plate of arroz con gandules. It’s a staple for any gatherings, holiday celebrations, or special dinners.\n\nOur recipe starts with a sauce called sofrito and a package of sazón seasonings before adding the gandules. You can add green olives stuffed with pimento and several cilantro sprigs for more flavor, and I really like this rice dish with plenty of green olives. Regardless of the recipe, this arroz con gandules is usually served with tostones (fried green plantains) or maduritos (fried ripe plantains) and a leaf of lettuce with a couple tomato slices. My beverage of choice with this meal is typically a Malta (a non-alcoholic barley beverage). Latinx-Hispanic foods deliver not only in flavors and textures, but are also full of important nutrients such as fiber, healthy fats, and several vitamins and minerals.” —Sylvia E Klinger, M.S., R.D., C.P.T.\n\n## 6. Congee (Jook)\n\n“I love congee, also known as jook! It\'s a rice porridge that can be made simply with broth and rice, and jazzed up with all types of toppings—dried pork, boiled or tea egg, pickled vegetables, green onions, chili or sesame oil, or whatever you have in your pantry. Congee is one of those dishes that every Chinese grandmother makes if you\'re feeling under the weather—kind of akin to chicken soup in Western cultures. It\'s warm, comforting, and perfect on a rainy day. I crave it during the winter, when I just want something comforting and warm.\n\nI generally whip it up in my Instant Pot—I throw in a chicken carcass from my freezer, then add a cup of rice, about 8 cups of water, ginger, and minced shiitake mushrooms. My favorite toppings are not necessarily traditional, but I love adding sautéed shiitake mushrooms, a soft boiled egg, sesame oil and chili oil, and green onions.” —Leanna Tu, M.S., R.D.N.\n\n## 7. Stewed Okra and Black-Eyed Peas\n\n“I\'m not a big sweets person. I love savory, earthy, full-flavor foods, and these (along with the ‘trinity of greens,’ as they call it—turnips, mustard, and collard greens with apple cider vinegar) are some of my favorite side dishes for Sunday family meals. Growing up in the South, my family owned land and my dad grew several types of produce and raised livestock. I came to know and enjoy these as meal staples. You can eat them with dinner or lunch, and I\'ll even eat black-eyed peas with breakfast if I have grits and eggs. It just depends on how I feel.\n\nBlack-eyed peas are easy, and you can buy them in bulk. Soak them overnight, and cook them like my mom used to do it in the pressure cooker or Instant Pot. I usually get the frozen option and cook them on the stovetop. As for the greens, fresh tastes better than canned to me, and are lower in sodium. I like veggie broth, onions, garlic, peppers, and a little olive oil in mine with apple cider vinegar.” —YaQutullah Ibraheem Muhammad, M.S., R.D.N., L.D.\n\n## 8. Baingan Bharta\n\n“Being a melting pot of different cultures (Pakistani, Italian, and Polish) has always been the core to my identity. Growing up, I was exposed to a variety of delicious cultural cuisines, and my two favorites involve one of the most versatile vegetables—eggplant. While eggplant parmigiana, from my Italian side, is a close second, baingan bharta (roasted eggplant curry), from my Pakistani side, is my all-time favorite dish. Baingan bharta is made from roasted eggplant and seasoned with the most commonly used masalas and spices, such as coriander and cumin, along with tomatoes, onion, and garlic. It’s absolutely delicious.\n\nBaingan bharta was one of the main dishes at all of the family events I had with my Pakistani father’s side. I loved to eat it with roti (flatbread), because I could eat with my hands and no utensils! These days, I enjoy baingan bharta with rice and a seasoned cucumber-yogurt sauce, also known as raita. My husband is Trinidadian and this dish is also popular in his culture–so we enjoy it often together! For a while, I was intimidated to make my own eggplant curry, but since it’s truly a lifelong favorite, I figured it was time to start making it from scratch.” —Kalloo\n\n## 9. Tachin\n\n“I’m Persian American—my parents grew up in Iran and moved here when they were in their early 20s—and crispy rice is my favorite. Tachin is a layered rice dish that looks like a cake, and inside is layered with a saffron, yogurt, egg-rice mixture, and boiled chicken. The top of this ‘rice cake’ is pretty much all crispy rice, and it’s garnished with sautéed barberries, slivered almonds, and pistachios!\n\nI was raised with this meal, and we always had it as a staple at our table, especially at celebrations—it’s a vibrant addition, and it’s so full of flavor. I like to pair a piece of tachin with a side of a leafy green salad or shirazi salad (a Persian cucumber, tomato, and onion salad) or an optional side that is common in Persian food, such as shallots in plain yogurt or fresh bread with feta cheese, walnuts, and herbs. Since this is predominantly a rice dish, it can be paired with any main entrée. This meal doesn’t have to be made with chicken or red meat—it can be made vegetarian (lacto-ovo friendly, since it will still contain eggs and yogurt), and you can pair it with your choice of plant protein. I’d encourage everyone to try it, and I love encouraging clients and friends to try new meals, especially ones that contain lots of herbs and spices.” —Yasi Ansari, M.S., R.D.N., C.S.S.D.\n\n## 10. Pão de Queijo\n\n“My mother is from Brazil, so I grew up going to visit family in Brazil and speaking Portuguese. My favorite food from Brazil is pão de queijo, or cheese bread, which I was introduced to as a young child in Brazil. Pão de queijo is soft, chewy, and has a delicious mild, cheesy flavor with a light, crusty outside and a soft inside.\n\nPão de queijo is versatile and can be eaten with any meal, or a snack just as is from the oven. It can also be sliced and eaten with jam, as a sandwich with filling, or as part of a delicious breakfast with a steaming cup of coffee. Since it’s made with tapioca flour, pão de queijo is also gluten-free. I always have tapioca flour in the pantry, or frozen pão de queijo that can be quickly baked for a delicious treat.” —Sonya Angelone, M.S., R.D.N.\n\n## 11. Muboora Une Dovi\n\n“I am a Shona girl from Zimbabwe, and my favorite cultural dish is muboora une dovi: pumpkin leaves (whose flavor is somewhat akin to a very light spinach) smothered in a creamy peanut butter sauce. Sometimes, hot peri peri peppers are added to give the dish some heat.\n\nPeanuts and peanut butter play an important role in Zimbabwean food culture; we add them to everything, from breakfast porridge to rice, meat, and vegetables. Peanuts and peanut butter are important for boosting both the nutritional value and taste of food. And pumpkin leaves are simply a Zimbabwean staple. My mother grew them in her garden, and when in season, we ate them often. Pumpkin leaves are typically not sold in United States supermarkets, but I have been lucky enough to find them in independent international shops and local farmers’ markets. If you grow your own pumpkins, pick the young, tender leaves, which are easier to prepare and have a smoother mouthfeel. (Here\'s a recipe with instructions on preparing the pumpkin leaves.) There’s a big nostalgia factor with this meal: I am an immigrant, and muboora une dovi is a dish that is loaded with memories of home, as it transports me to my mother\'s garden and kitchen.” —Cordialis Msora-Kasago, M.A., R.D.\n\n## 12. Rajma-Chawal\n\n“One of my all-time favorite Indian dishes is rajma-chawal: kidney beans (rajma) simmered in a delicious onion and tomato spice-infused sauce served with white rice (chawal). It’s almost like a vegetarian chili.\n\nMy school cafeteria in Madras, India, had delicious vegetarian food choices for lunch, though I typically took a homemade lunch every day. One day, I had forgotten it, and had to buy it at school. I tasted rajma and rice for my first time—it was so tasty and satisfying. I rushed home and told my mom all about it. My mom was not familiar with it since she was from a different state, but she was able to recreate it at home for us, and it became part of our family meal rotations. Now I continue to enjoy making it for my family. For a classic pairing, enjoy rajma with some plain rice or roti. I serve it to our family and friends all the time, and I have a simple recipe for this dish in my book *My Indian Table: Quick & Tasty Vegetarian Recipes**.”* —Vandana Sheth, R.D.N., C.D.E.\n\n## 13. Borscht\n\n“I am half Russian on my mom’s side and she makes a delicious dish called borscht, which is a beetroot soup that can take about half a day to make. It’s packed with delicious veggies like beets, cabbage, carrots, onion, parsnip, leeks and potatoes, and cooked in a flavorful beef stock. My grandma from Russia passed down the recipe to my mom, who would make it in the winter months at home while growing up in California. (You typically eat borscht in the colder winter months.)\n\nI enjoy it with a dollop of sour cream and a dark bread like pumpernickel. The rich flavor of the bread complements the heartiness of the soup. Cooking borscht makes the entire house smell amazing since it sits simmering on the stovetop most of the day. The scent evokes memories of my grandma and now my mom, enjoying meals at home together. It has a wonderful meld of flavors and is fairly customizable to meet your dietary needs. ” —Mia Syn, M.S., R.D.N.\n\n## 14. Dim Sum\n\n“A specialty of Cantonese cuisine is dim sum, which is a general reference to small foods that can be savory or sweet, and are always consumed with tea. Imagine small plates of dumplings, rice noodles, and buns—it\'s like Chinese dishes served tapas style and sipping tea for brunch!\n\nGrowing up, I remember going for dim sum with my parents and my siblings. It was a central component to family celebrations, whenever we had visitors and Chinese holidays. Often, there\'s no menu when you eat dim sum. Servers come around with a rolling cart loaded with a variety of dishes all meant to be shared by the entire table. There\'s no limit to how many dishes you *should* pick, and you’re encouraged to eat as the dishes hit the table.\n\nReflecting on my past dim sum brings about nostalgia, and when enjoying it in the present, it brings forth connection to those at the table, Chinese history, and tradition. I\'ve worked with several clients who are seeking connection to their Chinese heritage. Food is just one of the most powerful ways to foster this *and* a sense of belonging. Dim sum is a great opportunity to explore that!” —Laura Iu, R.D., C.D.N., R.Y.T.\n\n## 15. Jamaican Chicken Curry\n\n“One of my favorite foods growing up was my dad\'s chicken curry. He\'s Jamaican, and he cooked it on special occasions. It\'s a stew dish with strong flavors of curry and turmeric, as well as potatoes and carrots, which make it super hearty. It\'s a really savory dish with a ton of flavor and spice. He used to make it with rice and peas, another Jamaican staple.\n\nI think I used to love it so much because it was made on special occasions, and it\'s a dish that sounds easier to make than it is. It was also made with love, which I think really helps. You can always alter the spice level to your liking. For those not used to the flavors, it might be an acquired taste, but it’s definitely worth it. My dad also never made the dish the same way twice. Sometimes he would add more peppers or even put spinach in the dish.” —Shana Minei Spence, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N.\n\n## 16. Salsa Molcajeteada\n\n“One dish that I must have every time I am in Mexico is my mom’s salsa molcajeteada, a traditional salsa made with grilled jalapeños, onions, and tomato, along with lime juice, cumin, salt, and pepper. One important thing about preparing the salsa is that it is made in a molcajete (a bowl-like mortar traditionally carved in natural volcanic stone). Making it in a molcajete adds flavor and presentation. The flavor that it gets is hard to describe but distinguishes it from other salsas.\n\nIn my family, it is the perfect companion to carne asada (grilled steak) and homemade corn tortillas. I love the simplicity of all the ingredients, the fresh flavors, the spiciness, and the added layer of flavor that brings to the carne asada. Because the ingredients are grilled, usually we eat it fresh the day we grilled, but make extra to add to meals later the next day. It tastes like home and family.” —Su-Nui Escobar, R.D.N.\n\n## 17. Egg Tarts\n\n“The Hong Kong–style egg tarts were one of my favorite desserts-pastries growing up. Whenever I traveled to see my grandparents overseas in China every summer, we’d visit bakeries where they made them fresh every day. It’s essentially a flaky, pie-like pastry cup filled with sweet egg custard. I love that it’s mini-sized and just the right amount of sweet—like a mini pie! It’s warm and crispy on the outside, but when you bite into them, they’re soft and sweet on the inside. My mom has also made these from scratch before, and I love a great homemade egg tart.\n\nIt’s more of a dessert for me, but it’s commonly served in restaurants that serve dim sum. You can eat it warm or cold, but I love it freshly baked, right out of the oven! A shared dish like this can create so many memories. Food is so much more than just nourishment for our bodies. Culturally, it serves to bring people together.” —May Zhu, M.B.A., R.D.N., L.D.N.\n\n## 18. Collard Greens and Cornbread\n\n“I love collard greens and cornbread. While you *can* have greens without cornbread, it feels incomplete to me. In my family, the greens are slowly simmered with meat, creating a savory broth and tender greens. Then you add a capful of vinegar to your greens and eat them right with the cornbread.\n\nI’ve been eating greens for as long as I can remember, starting as a kid. Growing up in the South, we had access to plenty of inexpensive vegetables grown on farms or in a neighbor\'s backyard. So it\'s typical to see huge heads of collard greens hanging out in the kitchen just waiting to be cleaned at any given moment. And the process of getting, cleaning, cutting, and cooking the greens is all a part of the experience.\n\nGreens are special to me because it reminds me of how I sat and watched my grandma make them. It’s the dish that everyone in my family eats. They take time, but the effort is well worth it. And you can bet there won\'t be any left at the end of the day. Now, as an adult who happens to be a registered dietitian nutritionist, I love that I grew up eating such nutritious food and I didn\'t even know it.” —Marisa Moore, M.B.A., R.D.N., L.D.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:17:03', '2021-03-10 19:30:54', '/resources/images/GettyImages-1301473267.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/favorite-cultural-foods', 0, 0);

Food Stying by Drew Aichele. Prop Styling by Campbell Pearson.\r\n\r\n***Welcome to******Grocery Diaries******, a new series that illustrates just how varied and personalized “healthy eating” really is.** So many factors impact the choices we make at the grocery store, including access and affordability, health conditions, our individual cultural backgrounds, even what simply makes us (and our taste buds) happy. So we asked people across the country to share their grocery lists with us, and then called up a few of them to ask for more details. Why do they buy what they buy? How much do they spend? Who are they shopping for? What health conditions or nutritional concerns are they thinking about when they choose, for instance, almond milk over cow’s milk, or particular flavors or spices or treats? In this Grocery Diaries installment, we hear from an avid baker who has prediabetes and eats dessert every night.*\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n**Name:** Lissette Gomez\r\n**Age:** 50\r\n**Occupation:** Project manager\r\n**Location:** Monterey Park, California\r\n**Race/Gender:** Latina woman\r\n**Health conditions/dietary restrictions to consider:** Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), prediabetes, and a family history of diabetes\r\n**Grocery shopping frequency:** Shops for two people four times a month\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nLissette Gomez always saves room for a glass of milk, ahome-baked dessert, and two squares of dark chocolate after dinner. “I like to end my night with that stronger chocolate flavor, and the milk is very soothing. I feel like it relaxes me so I can go to bed peacefully,” she tells SELF.\r\n\r\nLissette bakes a new dessert every Sunday. Oftentimes, she makes a fruit-based loaf because it reminds her of eating sweet bread in El Salvador, where she was born. “I bake so much because El Salvador grows coffee, so the local tradition is to drink coffee with sweet bread. I kept the sweet bread but added the milk component,” she says. Lissette has prediabetes, a family history oftype 2 diabetes, and experiences low blood sugar (a condition called hypoglycemia) when she doesn’t eat for several hours. She does her best to include protein and fiber in every meal—including dessert—to stabilize her blood sugar, based on her doctor’s recommendation. To help accomplish this, she limits carbohydrates and uses nutrient-dense ingredients in many of her recipes. For example, Lissette substitutes bananas for some of the sugar in her muffin and bread recipes to increase the fiber content.\r\n\r\nPrediabetes happens when your blood sugar is higher than the typical range, but not high enough to be considered diabetes, according to theU.S. National Library of Medicine. And while anyone can experience a blood sugar dip after not eating for some time, people with prediabetes can be especially predisposed to that kind of fluctuation, which is why Lissette eats a daily snack to ensure that doesn’t happen. In addition to managing her prediabetes, Lissette also makes an effort to eat in a way that will help her avoid developing diabetes. There are two types of diabetes, but they can both lead to consistently high blood sugar above that prediabetes threshold, according to theMayo Clinic. With type 2 diabetes (the kind that runs in Lissette\'s family), your body doesn’t efficiently use insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar. When that happens, your body can’t produce enough insulin to make up for this inefficiency, leading to extra sugar in your blood. Along with lifestyle changes like being physically active, eating a nutrient-rich diet and being mindful of carbohydrate intake can help prevent prediabetes from progressing into diabetes. (It\'s even possible for some people toreverse prediabetes with these kinds of changes.)\r\nWith all of this in mind, Lissette shops for a variety of foods that suits her tastes and dietary needs. Here are 10 items she picks up in a typical grocery trip.\r\n\r\n1.Lindt Excellence 85% Cocoa Dark Chocolate: $2.99\r\n\r\n“I’ve tried other brands, but Lindt is so silky and good,” Lissette says. “It melts in your mouth. I haven’t been able to find anything else that’s comparable.” Lissette never liked milk chocolate and previously ateunsweetened baking chocolate before finding this bar.\r\n\r\n2. Plantains: $.50\r\n\r\nOne of Lissette’sfavorite breakfasts is a plate of plantains, beans, and Greek yogurt because she loves the combination of flavors. “The beans are salty and the plantains are really sweet. I love that salty-sweet combination,” she says. Sometimes, she makes a modified version of canoas de platanos maduros, or ground beef-stuffed plantains, a popular dish in El Salvador. “I cook the ground beef and eat plantains on the side like you would a potato,” she says.\r\n\r\n3.Guerrero White Corn Tortillas: $1.79\r\n\r\n“We cannot have a meal without tortillas. You’re going to laugh, but we even eat tortillas with spaghetti in my family,” Lissette says. She eats two tortillas a day to still enjoy a food she loves while reducing her carbohydrate intake. She typically uses them fortacos, quesadillas, or a quick breakfast wrap. “Cheese and avocado in a tortilla is a lifesaver. You cook it for 30 seconds in the microwave, and you’re ready to go,” she says.\r\n\r\n4.Simple Truth Flaxseed Meal Whole Ground: $3.79\r\n\r\nNearly 15 years ago after she was diagnosed withhigh cholesterol, Lissette started drinking one tablespoon of ground flax mixed with water every morning. “I remember my mom telling me that if you drink flax it helps with high cholesterol, and I’ve been doing it ever since,” she says. Turns out, Lissette’s mother was right. Flax is a great source of soluble fiber and may help lower cholesterol and keep blood sugar stable, according to theMayo Clinic. Although she no longer has high cholesterol, Lissette continues the habit and even adds flax in her baked goods.\r\n\r\n5.Organic Valley Grassmilk Organic Whole Milk: $5.99\r\n\r\n“I really love milk—I love anything dairy,” Lissette says. After dinner, she drinks plain whole milk or makes it into hot chocolate toaccompany dessert. She likes whole milk best because it’s more satisfying than reduced-fat versions. As Lissette explains, “It’s so creamy and rich. I’ll have milk with my coffee, and I don’t really want the coffee. I just want the milk!”\r\n\r\n6. Bananas: $.27\r\n\r\n“I use bananas a lot in my baking and to make smoothies,” Lissette says. “I don’t particularly like supersweet foods, and I also get nutrients from the banana.” Usually, Lissette substitutes bananas for a portion of white cane sugar in her recipes. (Depending on the size, one banana has nearly three grams of fiber and one gram of protein, plus calcium and potassium, according to theU.S. Food and Drug Administration. In comparison, cane sugar doesn’t contain any fiber, protein, or minerals.) Bananas are the star ingredient in hernutrient-dense take on Cocoa Pebbles. “I love Cocoa Pebbles. My version is made with oatmeal, milk, banana, and some cocoa powder. I cook it all together until the mixture is really creamy,” she says.\r\n\r\n7.Two Good Plain Greek Yogurt: $1.50\r\n\r\n“I put this on everything. You name it, and I’ll put Greek yogurt on it. I add a tablespoon on something, and it gives me the creaminess that I crave,” Lissette explains. She stirs Greek yogurt into heroatmeal and pasta, adds a dollop on top of quesadillas, or mixes it in her smoothies. One of her favorite snacks is a mango, coconut water, and Greek yogurt smoothie.\r\n\r\n8. Dinosaur Kale: $1.99\r\n\r\nLissette uses kale for just one purpose: making omelets. “I used to make a spinach omelet, but spinach doesn’t taste like anything. The kale is crunchier. It’s meatier. I like it a lot,” she says. She starts her day with a substantial breakfast like kale omelets becausethe protein and fiber are satisfying and keep her blood sugar stable.\r\n\r\n9.Vital Farms Pasture-Raised Eggs Large: $6.49\r\n\r\nAlthough Lissette eats omeletsin the morning because they’re a great source of protein, she believes eggs are best served at night. “I actually prefer eggs for dinner than for breakfast. They are a quick protein and so good,” Lissette explains. She uses eggs to make salads, fried rice, and huevos rancheros, a dish made with tortilla, eggs, and tomato sauce. According to Lissette, Vital Farms sells the most stunning eggs she’s ever seen. “The yolks are almost orange, it’s just so beautiful.” \r\n\r\n10. Avocado: $1.25\r\n\r\nIt seems like almost everyoneloves avocado these days—but not Lissette. “It’s not that I dislike avocado, but if avocados went out of season forever, then I would be okay,” she says. So why does she eat them? Because they’re a good source of monounsaturated fat, which can help keep her cholesterol low. She generally eats avocado in salads and says the fruit is a good substitute for mayonnaise. “The avocado makes tuna salad really creamy. It really works—I was surprised by how good it is.” \r\n\r\n*All products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

These kitchen workhorses are a multi-tasker’s dream, helping you to chop, blitz, blend, and yes—even knead dough—with speed and precision. At their most basic, a food processor is simply a gadget that supports the basic tasks we undertake in the kitchen. \n\nHaving a tool that makes cooking and prepping easier can make a big difference in how we feel about the time we spend in the kitchen. In fact, when you’re feeling sick of cooking, the practice of meal prepping with the help of a food processor is something nutritionist Wendy Lopez, R.D., highlights as one of the ways you can truly support yourself. \n\nOn the flip side, the food processor can help you maintain the rituals that ground you. Cookbook author Elizabeth Barbone, the founder of Cook Fast Eat Well, is big on making pizza dough in her food processor. “Friday night pizza is a sacred tradition in our house,” she tells SELF. “A food processor quickly develops gluten, making for a chewy and light dough.”\n\nFrom pizza dough to meal prep, choosing the best food processor involves thinking through the ways in which you want to use it. Are you looking to replace your blender with a supercharged do-it-all model? Or do you just need something small that you can keep stashed on the counter for quickly chopping onions? There are options to fit every need. To help us round up some of the best food processors to share with you, we’ve asked a few of our favorite food pros to share their thoughts, along with any tips and tricks that make using one even more helpful.\n\nAll products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

And this hefty 14-cup model provides it. It does the basics of chopping, slicing, shredding, and even kneading—and that’s just with the standard attachments. If you want to spiralize or get a perfect dice, there’s an attachment for that. Despite all its capabilities, you might be surprised that there\'s no digital interface—just two buttons: one for pulsing and one for continuous processing. And truly that’s all you need, no matter what you’re preparing. For Barbone, her food processor needs to do it all. “It can handle mincing a single garlic clove *and* churn easily through pizza dough.”If the 14-cup size seems extravagant, keep in mind that this tool is meant to help you out in the kitchen for years to come—well beyond the three-year warranty—so this size means you can make pizza dough in it whenever you decide to, even if you’ve only ever used it to make pestos and sauces up until then.Nutrition and business coach Ashely Pardo grew up watching her grandmother use this very Cuisinart food processor in the kitchen (she even inherited her first one from her!) and reaches for it whenever she’s making sauces, dips, or purées. “The food processor creates just a bit more texture than a high-speed blender (like a Vitamix), and it\'s perfect for hummus, pesto, tzatziki, chimichurri.” $219 AT WALMART\n\n\n![img](https://media.self.com/photos/60369f4061906e338dd0c905/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/kitchenaid.png)\n\n\n\nAmazon2The Small and Simple Option: KitchenAid Cordless 5-Cup ChopperRegardless of the size or brand of any food processor, how well it can actually process food is something to pay attention to. “Before buying a food processor, check out the strength of the motor,” says Barbone. “You want a food processor that can handle mixing dough and grinding foods into a nice smooth purée.” While mixing up doughs isn’t something you can do in this 5-cup chopper from Kitchenaid, that might not matter much if what you’re looking for is something that can help you chop, blend, whip, and purée. This chopper does all that without needing to be plugged in since it’s powered by a rechargeable lithium ion battery that lasts through the chopping of 40 onions. For apartment dwellers with small kitchens and not a lot of counter or cabinet space, this offers innovation in size, function (the cordless life is a game changer), and storage. For example, all the accessories for this model get stashed inside the bowl attachment when it’s not in use. Talk about smart design\n\n![img](https://media.self.com/photos/6036b19061906e338dd0c91f/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/breville.png)\n\n\n\nSur La Table3The Sleek, Quiet Option: Breville Sous-Chef 12-Cup Food ProcessorIf you’re looking for a workhouse food processor that can do it all, and one that’s still sleek enough to keep out on the countertop, this number from Breville is the one. It does everything a good food processor is meant to do—chop, slice, purée, and knead—but very quietly.

So when the opportunity to review ameal delivery service presented itself, I was psyched. A meal kit that requires no cooking whatsoever? Sign me up.\r\n\r\nI was attracted to Territory Foods for a few reasons (in addition to the welcome break from cooking). The company advertises that its food is made by a team of independent chefs who create meals in their own commercial kitchens and restaurants, as opposed to a central hub owned by the meal company located in another city, which is how many meal kit services operate. \r\n\r\nTerritory’semphasis on high-quality ingredients also caught my eye. It largely relies on ingredients that are highly nutritious (whole foods rich in essential nutrients, like veggies, whole grains, or fish) and more sustainably sourced when possible. For example, it uses mostly cage-free eggs, hormone-free meat, wild-caught or sustainably farm-raised fish, and organic and/or local produce when possible.\r\n\r\nI’ve got a couple of relevant dietary preferences (something Territory caters extremely well to): I’m not a strictvegan, but I do avoid animal products where I can—anytime I’m shopping and cooking for myself or ordering food at a place that has vegan options. I also havetype 1 diabetes, meaning my body doesn’t make insulin (the hormone that moves carbs out of the bloodstream and into your cells for energy storage). So I give myself insulin at mealtimes via my insulin pump. While *technically* I can eat however many carbs I want as long as I match them with enough insulin, I generally try to stick to under 50–60 grams per meal to avoid blood sugar spikes—and include a good amount of fiber, protein, and fat (like many people generally looking for nutritionally balanced meals).\r\n\r\nAnother part of their business model I appreciated: A company initiative calledTerritoryServes lets you purchase and donate meals to frontline workers, mainly in health care. For every two meals you give, it donates a third.\r\n\r\nI evaluated my experience with Territory Foods based on ourmeal delivery kit buying guide. Here’s how it went.\r\n\r\n**Customization**\r\n\r\nTerritory’s level of customization and meal selection process are excellent. There are about 45 items to choose from weekly, the majority being lunch and dinner. There are also a handful of breakfasts and à la carte family-style meal components, including family style veggie sides (likemashed potatoes), and protein mains (likesun-dried-tomato seared salmon), generally offering about three or four servings. There are also a couple of baked goods (likepaleo fudge brownies) and cold brew coffee.\r\n\r\nIf having that many choices sounds overwhelming, fear not—you can quickly whittle down your options with a number of precise, easy-to-set filters:\r\n\r\n- **Diet:** Territory offers 10 (!) different diet filters—including vegan, vegetarian, and Mediterranean, as well as trendy weight-loss diets likepaleo,keto, andWhole30—though you can also decline to select a preference.\r\n- **Ingredients you’d like to avoid:** There are dozens of options—cilantro, tree nuts, shellfish, vegan cheese, mushrooms, legumes, soy—which allows you to get pretty specific, and is great for picky eaters and people with food allergies or sensitivities.\r\n- **Taste:** A simpletaste quiz will influence which meals are more highly recommended to you. You can also select meals from a particular chef whose food you enjoy.\r\n- **Meal style:** You can look for breakfast, lunch/dinner, and/or à la carte.\r\n- **Nutritional profile:** You can opt to only see meals within an exact macronutrient range (for instance, meals between 30 and 60 grams of carbs with at least 20 grams of protein and 15 grams of fat). You can also sort meals from low to high by the amount of carbs or protein they contain. Another helpful feature is that the meal gallery page displays key nutrition facts (calories, carbs, protein, fat) for each meal without the need to click through to each individual page. This made it easy for me to steer clear of low-calorie or extra high-carb meals.\r\n\r\nBased on the settings you choose, Territory will suggest a menu, which is extremely easy to edit to your liking. While I played around with different filters to see how they worked, the only filter I actually used was the vegan one. The meals I ended up with were:\r\n\r\n-Berbere Split Peas with Brown Rice and Veggie Medley\r\n-Mediterranean Tofu with Rosemary Vegetables and Basmati Rice\r\n-Tofu Fajitas with Cauliflower Rice and Ranchero Sauce\r\n-Vegan Eggplant Lasagna with Broccoli Almondine\r\n-Vegetable Pot Pie Stew with Olive Oil Mashed Potatoes\r\n-North African–Style Chickpeas with Apricot Glazed Carrots and Minted Quinoa\r\n-Red Coconut Curry Tofu with Veggies\r\n-Vegan RightRice Spanish-Style Paella with Mushrooms\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, I browsed some of the non-vegan options, too, and they sounded just as tasty (and veggie packed!) as my picks—like pistachio-crusted tuna cakes with fennel apple slaw or Greek chicken bowl with lemon tarragon rice.\r\n\r\nThe only place I ran into limited selection issues was breakfast, but this was actually not a huge disappointment for me, since I generally like to stick with the basics.\r\n\r\n**Affordability**\r\n\r\nI’ll go ahead and say it: These meals are not cheap. The standard sized options, said to be “the ‘just right’ helping for most folks”—I found this to be true—start at $13.95 each. All of my meals cost that much, but many of the meat and fish options were pricier, anywhere from $15.50 to $18.95. You can also downsize and order the smaller “boost” size of a meal for $10.95, meant for “lighter eaters and grazers.” (Not I.)\r\n\r\nThe more you order, the more you save. You can pick a 10- or 18-meal plan (which gets you one free), or choose a recurring order (which saves you 5% on your weekly order).\r\n\r\nWorking with $13.95 per meal, that puts them at the top of the rough price range for aHomeChef meal-sized serving, for instance. The higher price point is in line with the pricier organic and more sustainably sourced ingredients, and the fact that all the work is done for you. Plus, the variety comes at a premium—no big batches, repeat meals, or getting bored.\r\n\r\nWhile Territory isn’t the most inexpensive meal kit option, it’s a decent deal compared to takeout (which runs about $20 to $25 for me on average, including taxes, delivery fees, and tip). I can get more mileage out of takeout, though, since I can usually count on having leftovers.\r\n\r\n**Order and Delivery Process**\r\n\r\nYou can order however few or many items you like a week through Territory’s custom plan or go with a pre-set 10-meal or 18-meal plan. The options to skip a delivery week or pause your subscription altogether are very easy to find. And you can choose to have meals delivered on Sunday, Wednesday, or both. (Different meals are available on different days.) Currently, the company delivers to major cities like my home base of New York City, the D.C. metro area, the Bay Area, and Houston.\r\n\r\nI opted for a custom plan of eight meals spread across both delivery days, so that my meals would be sitting in the fridge for less time. Both deliveries went off without a hitch, and I got an email notifying me when the food was out for delivery and when it had arrived, which was nice. The food was delivered in recyclable containers, compostable paper trays and plastic lids, and packed with gel ice packs to keep it plenty cold. One of the containers had a little bit of liquid spilling out, but that’s common enough with delivery that I wasn’t too bothered.\r\n\r\n**Ease of Use**\r\n\r\nAh, the simplest thing about Territory Foods. People who prefer to cook and those who like to sing for their supper, look elsewhere—it took about two minutes to “prep” my food.\r\n\r\nAll of the meals came labeled with simple heating instructions for the microwave and stove top—basically, heating for one or two minutes, stirring once or twice. I experimented with a few different methods: microwaving the food right in the container and then eating out of the container or plating; plating and then microwaving; and cooking in a sauce pan and then plating. I didn’t notice any difference in the taste or texture based on the cooking method I used. The meals also come with a “best enjoyed by” date based on how well the ingredients hold up. (All are good for three days after the delivery date—after that, you can freeze them.)\r\n\r\n**Nutrition Profile**\r\n\r\nA big marketing point for Territory Foods is that it’s all free of gluten and dairy—which is great for people with celiac disease, a wheat allergy, or lactose intolerance—as well as refined sugar. These ingredients are not something most other people need to avoid (andrefined sugar is not evil!), but could be a plus if you’re steering clear for any reason.\r\n\r\nThe company *does* note that the food is made in kitchens where gluten, dairy, and other allergens may be present, though—which might be a cause for concern for someone with severe celiac disease or a severe nut allergy, for instance.\r\n\r\nThe most common ingredients in the vegan meals I ordered were veggies (a nice wide variety, from leafy to root), whole grains, beans and legumes, and plant-based proteins (namely, tofu), plus some nuts and nut-based vegan cheeses.\r\n\r\nI found my meals to be pretty well-balanced and satiating, with a nice mix of carbs, protein, and fat. Standard sized meals range, on average, between about 450 and 600 calories, while the lighter meals and snacks run between 250 to 450 calories. I noticed there was some variability, though, especially among the non-vegan options—for instance, the keto tuna cakes with pistachio crust, coleslaw, and pesto sauce were 739 calories, while standard-size meals were closer to 300. A big difference in caloric bang for your buck! But, then again, Territory is all about catering to your dietary needs, and since you can easily select for minimum calorie count and more, that shouldn’t be a problem.\r\n\r\n**Taste**\r\n\r\nFor the most part, my meals were pretty tasty and satisfying. Just about everything was well-seasoned, adequately spiced, and nothing was overcooked—no mushy, undersalted veggies here—but I wouldn\'t have minded a bit more oomph in a couple of dishes since I tend to double the spices and herbs a recipe calls for.\r\n\r\nIt was awesome to find dishes from a variety of cuisines too—there was always something to suit my mood sitting in the fridge. And I definitely appreciated the mix of “obviously vegan” meals (like tofu-based dishes) and “accidentally vegan” meals (like grain and bean-based dishes).\r\n\r\nThe only miss was the Mediterranean tofu with veggies and rice dish, which was oversalted, missing most of the collard greens that were promised, and contained a couple of unpleasantly tough, gristly bits of tofu.\r\n\r\n**The Bottom Line**\r\n\r\nI don’t think I realized quite how much I needed (okay, wanted) a break from cooking until my first Territory boxful of ready-made meals came. I’ve ordered takeout pretty rarely since the pandemic started—really only on special occasions, like seeing a friend or at the end of a particularly rough week. I genuinely enjoy cooking for myself most of the time, but sometimes I do get tired of it. I honestly forgot how delightful it is to *not* cook everything you eat.\r\n\r\nOverall, Territory Foods offers some of the best qualities of takeout—namely, convenience and variety—while avoiding some of its downsides too. For one, the sometimes genuinely overwhelming number of options in New York. (I know, a ridiculous thing to complain about! But when I’m borderline hangry and the decision paralysis hits, it’s an issue.) Territory also removed the sometimes long and unpredictable delivery time; the cost of fees, tax, and tips; and the lack of nutrition facts. The food was also tasty, very aligned to my dietary needs, and reasonably filling. All in all, if you’re looking for a well-rounded, nutrition-packed takeout alternative, Territory Foods is a very solid choice.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:20:21', '2021-03-10 19:35:51', '/resources/images/celebrity_chefs_feature@2x.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/review/territory-foods-meal-kit', 0, 0);

But it’s a really important topic to explore. Heart disease kills more Americans than any other cause, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And what you eat can actually play a big part in it: In one 2017 study published in *JAMA*, researchers estimated that certain eating habits (like consistently having a lot of sodium or not enough veggies) may contribute to about 45% of deaths from cardiometabolic diseases, which include heart disease, strokes, and type 2 diabetes.\n\nTo understand why what you eat is so important, it can be helpful to take a closer look at the function of your all-important ticker. Your heart is the epicenter of your body, pumping oxygen-rich blood through your arteries to the rest of you. When arteries narrow or clog, a condition known as coronary heart disease, they cut off blood to your heart, jeopardizing the entire organ.\n\nYour main goal is to keep your blood vessels pliable and unobstructed, so blood can continue to flow freely. And what you eat plays a part in determining the amount of build-up or clarity in those vessels. There’s a lot to unpack with the connection between eating and your heart health, though. Here’s what you need to know.\n\n## 1. A heart-healthy diet doesn’t have to be a really restrictive *diet.*\n\nWhen you picture a heart-healthy diet, you may think of a big bowl of plain oatmeal or a life without butter. The truth is that eating for heart health isn’t about focusing on one (or a few) foods, or avoiding some completely. It’s more about eating foods that are beneficial in multiple ways and establishing patterns you can stick with to protect your heart over time.\n\n“Consistency is really the most important thing rather than doing something that’s very restrictive,” Kurt M. Hong, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of clinical medicine and executive director of the Center for Clinical Nutrition at USC, tells SELF.\n\nConsider your diet part of a preventive approach to avoiding coronary heart disease, as well as to lowering risk factors of it like high blood pressure and high cholesterol—which can contribute to early heart attacks and strokes, Dr. Hong says. For best results, combine your eating plan with exercise, which keeps blood vessels pliable and helps to reduce inflammation. “People who exercise regularly tend to do much, much better in terms of heart health,” says Dr. Hong.\n\nYou may have already heard of some eating plans for heart health, including the Mediterranean Diet (rich in whole grains, nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, and of course, olive oil) and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH, eating plan (high in whole grains and fruits and vegetables rich in potassium). While these are evidence-backed plans for a heart-healthy diet, the idea of following a “diet” may not be the most appealing for the long term. Instead, you can take some of their tactics—along with some other research-backed components—and use them to create a more general guide for how you can eat to best promote your heart health.\n\n## 2. You don’t need to avoid all fat.\n\nKeeping your heart healthy doesn’t mean automatically cutting out fat. “Fat is an important macronutrient that should be present in our diet,” Rafaela G. Feresin, Ph.D., an assistant professor of nutrition at Georgia State University, tells SELF. Your body uses fat for energy, nutrient absorption, and organ protection.\n\nInstead, think about emphasizing certain sources of fats over others.\n\nYou should consider reducing consumption of saturated fat (mainly found in meat, pork, poultry, and dairy products) and trans fat (which occurs naturally in meat and dairy products and is artificially formed in fried and baked goods), says Dr. Feresin.\n\nWhen you eat too much of these fats, you can increase the production of cholesterol and activate inflammatory cells that can help that cholesterol nestle into your arteries, potentially leading to blockages. While some recent studies suggest that the link between dietary saturated fat and heart risk is more complicated than once thought, the U.S. Dietary Guidelines still recommend that less than 10% of your daily calories come from saturated fats. And if you already have high cholesterol, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends keeping saturated fats to just 5-6% of your total daily calories. (The evidence is pretty clear on trans fats, though—minimize them as much as possible. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has even banned artificially produced trans fats, and they are being phased out of the food supply.)\n\nMonounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats, on the other hand, have the opposite effect of saturated fats and trans fats on cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk, says Dr. Feresin. In fact, according to a presidential advisory from the AHA published in *Circulation**,* replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease to an extent similar to statin treatment.\n\nRich sources of monounsaturated fats include avocado, olives, and avocado and olive oil—again, hello Mediterranean diet. Sources of polyunsaturated fats include omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which you can find in sunflower seeds, flaxseed or flaxseed oil, walnuts, and fish. And those omega-3s may be particularly protective: Not only do they help stabilize the progression of plaques that can clog heart vessels, but they’re also anti-inflammatory, says Dr. Hong—and chronic inflammation itself is an independent risk factor for heart disease. Eat fish at least twice a week, the AHA says. If you’re vegan or vegetarian, you can work on getting those omega-3s through things like flaxseed or chia seeds.\n\nGenerally, it’s best to get your omega-3s from natural food sources rather than supplements.\n\n“We never know how the supplements are absorbed,” says Dr. Hong. Plus, supplements can give you a false sense of security and lead you to eat a less balanced diet, he says. They’re also not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) like drugs are, so you can’t be exactly sure what you’re getting.\n\n## 3. Eat more fiber-rich foods.\n\nMost Americans fall short of the recommended daily intake for fiber, a form of carbohydrate—ideally, you should be taking in 14 grams for every 1,000 calories you eat.\n\nThat can be a problem, because fiber, the hard-to-digest components of foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, can help your heart in multiple ways. For one, fiber can reduce cholesterol, which can keep your arteries clearer, says Dr. Hong. Fiber can also help you regulate your blood sugar, which is important because chronic high blood sugar can put you at risk of diabetes and increase your risk of a heart attack, strokes, and other heart problems, he says. (Diabetes is also a risk factor for issues like heart attacks as well.)\n\nFiber may also help you cultivate a better, more diverse community of bacteria in your gut, which can ultimately contribute to reduced inflammation throughout your body, including in your cardiovascular system, says Dr. Hong.\n\nThen there’s the fact that naturally fiber-rich foods, like whole grains, are packed with additional helpful nutrients. Most whole grains contain B vitamins and minerals such as selenium and magnesium, says Dr. Feresin, which can help your body regulate blood pressure, ward off damage to the cells, and more.\n\nIf you’re looking for ways to add fiber, Dr. Feresin recommends choosing whole wheat pasta or brown rice pasta instead of regular pasta, brown rice rather than white rice, whole wheat bread instead of white bread, whole wheat cereal, and whole oats. Try the pseudo whole grains amaranth, chia seeds, and quinoa. Add quinoa to your salad or chia seeds to your yogurt or overnight oats, she recommends. High-fiber fruits and vegetables include raspberries, pears, apples (with the skin), bananas, green peas, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts.\n\n## 4. Watch your sodium intake.\n\nSodium is an essential mineral that helps control your body’s fluid balance. It honestly helps a lot of food taste really great, too. However, most of us consistently take in more sodium than we need—and it’s that chronic overconsumption that can become an issue for your heart. That can mean more fluid in your blood vessels, potentially leading to an increase in blood pressure that can make your heart have to work harder to pump blood throughout your body, says Dr. Feresin.\n\nTo reduce blood pressure, the AHA recommends eating no more than 2,300 mg of sodium per day. Canned foods, preserved foods, and restaurant meals can be particularly high in sodium, Dr. Hong says. So can processed meats like hot dogs, salami, sausage, and ham. While delicious, the combo of sodium and saturated fat in these meats, especially if eaten frequently over time, makes them pretty unsavory for heart health, says Dr. Hong. In fact, the top source of sodium and saturated fat in the American diet is sandwiches. Which doesn’t necessarily mean you need to swear off sandwiches forever—but it’s good to know if you’re specifically trying to eat in a way that supports optimum heart health.\n\nJust as important as reducing sodium intake is upping your potassium intake, a mineral that counterbalances sodium in regulating your fluid balance, says Dr. Feresin. The average American consumes far less than the recommended amount of 4,700 mg per day.\n\nFind potassium in apricots, prunes, oranges, squash, spinach, tomato, asparagus, beans, lentils, milk, yogurt, chicken, turkey, beef, salmon, and more, Dr. Feresin says. And to add flavor to dishes without sprinkling on extra salt, try adding seasonings, like herbs, hot spices, garlic, or saffron.\n\n## 5. Fill your plate with color.\n\nFruits and vegetables are filled with fiber, and they are delivery vessels for lots of powerful micronutrients, including compounds called polyphenols. “These bioactive compounds not only contribute to taste, color, and flavor of plant foods, but they also have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hypertensive properties,” says Dr. Feresin. They help keep cholesterol from forming plaques, prevent blood cells from sticking together, improve artery dilation, decrease arterial stiffness, decrease blood pressure, and more, she says.\n\nNo one polyphenol can be considered the best, and there’s no one particular piece of produce you should pick up every single day. Variety is the key.\n\n“One of the things that we believe is that those polyphenols are acting additively and synergistically, so it’s not just one; it’s actually more than one that is exerting the effect in the body,” says Dr. Feresin. “That’s one of the reasons why we advocate the increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, because you\'re not only going to be getting a single polyphenol. You’re going to be getting hundreds of polyphenols, and getting all the other nutrients as well.”\n\nAim for at least four to six servings of fruits and vegetables per day, says Dr. Hong. (Servings also depend on factors like your activity level—check out MyPlate.gov for more info.) Mix it up so that you can take in a broad spectrum of nutrients at most meals. “I like to see on your plate at least three or four different colors,” says Dr. Hong.\n\n## 6. Limit added sugars.\n\nWhen talking about heart health, it’s a good idea to choose carbs that are rich in nutrients like fiber, rather than those that don’t bring a whole lot else to the nutrient table. That means it may be a good idea to limit your consumption of added sugars, which are often found in items like sodas, baked goods, breads, and salad dressings. “Added sugars” refers to sugars or syrups added during processing, not to the natural sugars in fruits or dairy.\n\nAdded sugars contribute to a lot of excess calories, says Dr. Hong. Calories aren’t inherently bad—you need them for energy—but if you’re looking to monitor your calorie intake for health-related reasons, like diabetes management, mainly getting them from other sources may be best. You don’t have to completely avoid *all* added sugars, but the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends limiting your consumption to no more than 10% of your daily caloric intake.\n\nNearly half of all our added sugars come from beverages, according to the guidelines, which makes what you’re drinking a solid jumping-off point for reevaluation. When you find an area where you can make a change—say, a regular soda habit—take it slowly, says Dr. Hong. Let’s say you drink four sodas a week. You could try reducing it down to two, and then later one, he says.\n\nYou may be able to notice some beneficial effects of swapping out your sugary beverages or other kinds of food in some health markers. In a study published in the *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*, people who reduced their intake of refined grains, added sugars, and sugar-sweetened beverages (and increased their intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, and nuts) reduced several markers of cardiovascular risk, such as blood pressure and fasting blood sugar, within six months.\n\n## 7. Watch your alcohol intake.\n\n“A lot of folks really underestimate how much alcohol they’re drinking,” says Dr. Hong. “They may have a drink when they get home, another drink or two with dinner, and then a nightcap.”\n\nTwo drinks a day (for men) and one a day (for women) are considered reasonable amounts—the U.S. Dietary Guidelines consider that “moderate” consumption. More than that, and you’re drinking a lot of excess sugar. “I remind patients: Guess what alcohol gets broken down to? Sugar,” says Dr. Hong. Plus, it’s easy to snack extra when you’re drinking. Like a lot of other behaviors we’ve mentioned, this isn’t an automatically “bad” eating habit that you can never practice if you want a healthy heart. But, depending on what you snack on and how often you’re snacking while drinking, frequent extra snacking on top of your regular eating patterns can lead to weight gain, another risk factor for cardiovascular disease. (The science behind weight and heart health is complex—there are other factors to consider beyond weight that you can read more about here.)\n\nWhat’s more, research suggests excess drinking can affect your heart in other ways besides weight gain. According to a study review published in the journal *Alcohol Research*, too much alcohol could contribute to increased blood pressure and inflammation, and may also promote the clumping together of platelets—which can lead to the formation of dangerous blood clots.\n\nA heart-healthy diet doesn’t have to mean never having that glass of wine, that store-bought pack of cupcakes, or that extra sprinkle of salt on your popcorn. It’s more about making small changes—and following them consistently—that can add up to a big difference for your heart.\n\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:21:06', '2021-03-10 19:37:16', '/resources/images/veggies_healthy_eating.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/heart-healthy-diet', 0, 0);

Food Stying by Drew Aichele. Prop Styling by Campbell Pearson.\r\n\r\n*Welcome to**Grocery Diaries**, a new series that illustrates just how varied and personalized “healthy eating” really is. So many factors impact the choices we make at the grocery store, including access and affordability, health conditions, our individual cultural backgrounds, even what simply makes us (and our taste buds) happy. So we asked people across the country to share their grocery lists with us, and then called up a few of them to ask for more details. Why do they buy what they buy? How much do they spend? Who are they shopping for? What health conditions or nutritional concerns are they thinking about when they choose, for instance, almond milk over cow’s milk, or particular flavors or spices or treats? In this Grocery Diaries installment, we hear from a Kentucky grocery store owner working to increase access to fresh food in Louisville’s West End.*\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n**Name:** Shauntrice Martin\r\n**Age:** 36\r\n**Occupation:** Lobbyist and grocery store owner\r\n**Location:** Louisville, Kentucky\r\n**Race/Gender:** Black woman\r\n**Health conditions/dietary restrictions to consider:** Shauntrice has a family history of diabetes and high blood pressure.\r\n**Grocery shopping frequency:** Shops twice a week for two people\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nSome of Shauntrice Martin’sfavorite childhood memories involve making dinner with her grandparents. “I learned a lot of stories about our family during that time when we were preparing meals,” she tells SELF. Shauntrice also developed an appreciation for fresh food and home-cooked meals after watching her great-grandmother pick vegetables from her farm. “I remember being able to see everything that got put in a recipe and understanding the importance of each ingredient,” she says. “If we were out of something, then the entire recipe would change.” \r\n\r\nAt home Shauntrice ate very differently. Her mom worked long hours and didn’t have time to cook, so Shauntrice frequentlyate microwaveable meals or other packaged food. What’s more, her mom just didn’t have access to fresh food at the local grocery store. “We were on food stamps, but the place we got our food from didn\'t really have fresh options,” she says. \r\nAs an adult, Shauntrice wondered whether food affected her family’s medical history. Her grandmother had diabetes and her mom developed high blood pressure, but to Shauntrice’s knowledge, her great-grandmother didn’t have these types of medical conditions. “I think a lot about the way my mother ate versus the way my great-grandmother ate, and that really influences what I eat now,” she says.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to mention that Shauntrice’s mom smoked, which is one risk factor for developinghigh blood pressure. High blood pressure happens when your blood puts excessive force against your artery walls, according to theNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). People develop high blood pressure for various reasons, including a high-sodium diet, a family history of the condition, and smoking, according to theMayo Clinic. Over time, high blood pressure can lead to other medical conditions like a heart attack. And while there are many ways to try to prevent or manage high blood pressure, regularly eating a variety of nutritious foods (especially fruits and vegetables) is one of them.\r\n\r\nShauntrice is also concerned about developingdiabetes, which happens when your blood sugar, or blood glucose, is consistently too high, theNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) explains. Glucose is our body’s main source of energy and we get it from food and drinks. People with diabetes can develop issues like nerve damage, eye problems, and kidney disease. Treatment plans vary and can include taking insulin or limiting the amount of saturated fat, sodium, and sugar you eat.\r\n\r\nWhen determining how to eat in order to feel her best and try to avoid these conditions, Shauntrice doesn’t study food labels to track things like sugar or saturated fat. To her, healthy eating means including a variety of fresh food in her diet. “I look at the colors in my basket. Do I have an array of fruits and vegetables?” she explains. But this can be a hard goal to reach. Shauntrice lives in the West End of Louisville, a predominantly Black area she says has only one large grocery store. The area is a food desert, meaning it’s a low-income community with too few grocery stores, according to theU.S. Department of Agriculture. \r\nBefore the pandemic Shauntrice grocery-shopped in a wealthier neighborhood, where the stores had a larger selection of fresh produce. Then, in June, her only local grocery store closed for a period during the Black Lives Matter protests. Shauntrice was inspired to open her own grocery store,Black Market KY, which sells products from local and Black-owned companies. “It was really important for me to do this,” she says. “The community is predominantly Black, but we don’t have a lot of Black businesses. It’s important to me that more Black businesses can make money.” Now Shauntrice shops at her own store for herself and her seven-year-old-son, Iniejah, and she also sources some of their food from other local shops and sellers. Here are 10 items she eats in a typical week.\r\n\r\n**1. Plantains: $7**\r\n\r\nShauntrice learned about plantains when she studied abroad in Trinidad during college. “I thought it was like a Trinidadian banana,” she says. “I don’t even know if I had heard the word *plantain* before.” She says living in another country for a semesteropened her mind to food that she wouldn’t normally try. “I was super picky before going out of the country,” Shauntrice says. “I committed to myself that I would try new stuff. I didn’t want to disrespect people and their food.” Now fried plantains are one of her favorite snacks. “I really like when they’re blackened,” she says.\r\n\r\n**2. Jamaican ackees: $13**\r\n\r\nDuring her time in Trinidad, Shauntrice also learned about ackee, a fruit native to West Africa and also common in the Caribbean. She rememberseating ackee with salt fish (people often eat the two together) at breakfast. At the time Shauntrice thought the large chunks of pale yellow fruit were scrambled eggs. “I thought, Maybe this isn’t a chicken egg. I didn’t ask any questions,” she says. (She later learned about ackee from her professor.) Shauntrice makes ackee at home whenever it’s in stock at her local African market. “It’s not even always at the market that I go to,” she tells us. “I usually call ahead and make sure it’s there.” With that said, Shauntrice usually eats the fruit alone instead of with its usual seafood companion: “I’m not good at making salt fish.”\r\n\r\n**3. Organic eggs from Phonograph Farms: $3**\r\n\r\nEvery three weeks Shauntrice drives three hours tobuy eggs from this farm owned by former NFL player George Wilson. “It’s our best-selling item at the store,” she says. Shauntrice says Phonograph eggs taste noticeably different from the standard grocery store egg: “They’re delicious. They’re heartier, and the yolk is thicker. They’re much fluffier when you’re making scrambled eggs or pancakes.”\r\n\r\n**4.****Wells Made Co. Roasted Banana Chip Peanut Butter****: $14**\r\n\r\nIt was love at first taste when Shauntrice tried thisbanana peanut butter at a women-owned business pop-up event in 2019. “There’s little banana chips in it. It’s kind of like cookies and cream ice cream but with banana chips,” she says. “It just tastes really good, and it’s super sweet from the banana. I haven’t had a nut butter with that element in it.” She eats this on top of cinnamon raisin toast and in her smoothies.\r\n\r\n**5.****Beeing2Gether** **raw honey: $6**\r\n\r\nShauntrice’s friends frequently tag her in Facebook posts about Louisville businesses. That’s how Shauntrice learned about Keith Griffith III, a 13-year-old beekeeper and owner of Beeing2Gether honey. She loved his ambition and supports Keith by selling his honey at Black Market KY. “When I was 13, I wasn’t thinking about starting a business,” she says. “I own a business now, and I can’t imagine being mature enough to do that even 10 years ago. That’s amazing to me.” She likes to drizzle honey on her baked fish, in her smoothies, and on top ofpancakes.\r\n\r\n![Image may contain Animal Seafood Food Sea Life Lobster and Ribs](/resources/images/medium12102020-R_C-Chelsea-Kyle-1782.jpg)\r\n\r\nChelsea Kyle. Food Stying by Drew Aichele. Prop Styling by Campbell Pearson.\r\n\r\n**6.****Sausage from Cleav’s Family Market**: **$10**\r\n\r\nShauntrice carries meat from Black-owned farm Cleav’s Family Market at her store and also buystheir ground meats for herself. “What I usually do is get hamburger and sausage, and I mix the two,” Shauntrice says. Then she adds in chopped celery, bell pepper, onions, and garlic to make “water burgers,” named for the fact that they’re extra juicy with the added vegetables. “That’s how my great-grandmother used to make burgers,” she says.\r\n\r\n**7. Trader Joe’s Organic Roasted Seaweed With Sea Salt: $3.49**\r\n\r\n“I go through so many of these every week—probably like 20 packs,” Shauntrice says. “I always crack one open in the car on the way home from Trader Joe’s.” Initially she bought these for Iniejah when he was a toddler but has grown to love them too. In fact, she always keeps a few in her purse in case she wants acrispy snack when running errands.\r\n\r\n**8. Smucker’s Uncrustables Peanut Butter & Grape Jelly Sandwich: $7.79**\r\n\r\nIniejah is allowed to make anything thatdoesn’t need to be cooked, which explains why he goes through at least one box of Uncrustables a week. “He’s into making his own stuff. I think he really just likes the independence,” Shauntrice says. Plus, he can unwrap one without worrying about cleaning up after himself. “He could make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but then he has to wash dishes and I think he’d rather not.”\r\n\r\n**9.****Blue Diamond Almond Breeze Almond Milk Vanilla****: $1.99**\r\n\r\n“When I was pregnant, dairy did not sit well with my stomach and I just stuck with almond milk afterward,” Shauntrice says of her milk preference. “Our first choice is the vanilla sweetened, but a lot of times that’s out for some reason.” Living ina food desert, she can’t always find the food she wants, such as organic produce and this almond milk. When she does find this almond milk while shopping, Shauntrice buys extra so she always has some on hand.\r\n\r\n**10. Apple juice from Ida’s Juice: $5**\r\n\r\nShuantrice used to buy her apple juice from a woman named Ida, a local Louisville mom. “You would message her on Facebook with your order and she delivered it to your home.” So what made Ida’s juice so special? Shauntrice says it reminded her of the fresh-pressed cider she likes to drink in the fall. Ida doesn’t sell juice anymore, Shauntrice says, so Shauntrice’shomemade smoothies have replaced her juice habit instead. “My favorite blend is probably one with cilantro, lime, and kale. It’s super tangy,” she says.\r\n\r\n*All products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (56, 11, 'Which of the Pregnancy Food Rules Are Worth Paying Attention To?', 'There’s a lot of info out there—here’s what matters.', '![What Pregnancy Food Rules Should You Actually Follow](/resources/images/preg_woman%252520healthy_eating.jpeg)Caiaimage/Paul Bradbury/Adobe Stock\r\n\r\n“Healthy eating” is complicated, and it gets even more so when you add your soon-to-be baby into the mix. But what pregnancy food rules are worth paying attention to, and which ones are just overblown?\r\n\r\nWhile it’s always a good idea to eat a generally well-balanced diet full of nutrient-rich choices, it becomes even more crucial when you’re pregnant. You don’t need to suddenly double your calories to “eat for two” once you’re expecting—yep, that’s one of the pregnancy food myths right there—but you do need to eat enough of the right nutrients to keep your body running smoothly and your baby developing properly.\r\n\r\n“Nutrition is always important, but especially so during pregnancy because what you eat is going to be the main source of nutrition for the baby,” Jaime Tucker, R.D., a dietitian in the ob-gyn department atUC Davis Health, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nThat’s why the time when you’re thinking about getting pregnant can be a great opportunity to take a look at your eating habits to see where you’re at currently, and what you may need to focus more on.\r\n\r\nIt’s a chance for you to make a change in your life that you can continue after your child is born,Manijeh Kamyar, M.D., a high-risk ob-gyn, member of the editorial task force for*Your Pregnancy and Childbirth*, a book published by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and a past member of ACOG’s Patient Education Review Panel, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nHealthy eating during pregnancy looks a little different for each person (though there are some general recommendations), and misconceptions about what to eat and what not to eat at this major life stage abound. Cutting through the noise and focusing on the expert recommendations that actually deserve your attention will make it easier to take care of both you and your baby.\r\n\r\nBecause the truth is, healthy eating during pregnancy doesn’t look *that* different from healthy eating before and after pregnancy—save for a few key things.\r\n\r\n## Pregnancy nutrition is about focusing on a healthy diet in general.\r\n\r\nThe most basic tenets of healthy eating are the same when you’re pregnant and when you’re not. “If you follow the general guidelines for appropriate nutrition outside of pregnancy, you’re pretty much following what you’re supposed to do inside pregnancy as well,” Dr. Kamyar says. That means focusing on eating nutrient-rich foods, like fruits, vegetables, lean meats, whole grains, poultry, and fish, and limiting the amount of foods you eat that are low in nutrients and high inadded sugars and saturated or trans fats, she says. If you’re already doing that, you’re off to a good start.\r\n\r\nThe exact amount ofprotein andcarbohydrates you need to get every day will depend on multiple factors, including your health going into pregnancy, how your baby is developing, your dietary restrictions, and your activity levels. ACOG does, however, note thatfats should make up about 20 to 35 percent of a pregnant person’s total calorie intake. Fat is important for fetal brain development, and your body needs it to properly absorb and use some vitamins.\r\n\r\nTo get a general idea of how many grams of carbs, protein, and fat you should eat each day, ACOG recommends starting with the food-planning guide atMyPlate, which can help you determine a well-balanced diet. (Of course, it’s important to recognize that this kind of tracking can be triggering for people with disordered eating.) If you can work with a registered dietitian for a more personalized plan, that’s great too.\r\n\r\nAs for nutrients, certain vitamins and minerals are important in *any* diet, not just during pregnancy. While eating whole foods can make it easier to check off important pregnancy nutrients (more on that later) without thinking too hard about it, not everyone has the same access to fresh foods. It’s totally fine if packaged and “processed” foods are part of your diet for whatever reason, whether because of access or because of cravings (or both). In fact, processed foods—which just mean a food has been combined with another ingredient or changed from its natural state—can include nutrient-rich choices like whole wheat bread, almond butter, and yogurt, as SELFreported previously. And people’s cultures often impact the foods that make up their usual diet,Amy Valent, D.O., maternal-fetal medicine specialist and assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology in the Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine, tells SELF. That’s all the more reason why our societal understanding of what automatically is or isn’t “healthy” to have (during pregnancy and otherwise) needs to change.\r\n\r\nWhat’s more, pregnancy nutrition isn’t all or nothing: It’s not about being perfect every single day, but making choices that help promote great health *most* of the time. “Do your best with what you have, and whatever efforts you’re able to put in,” Dr. Valent says. Evenlearning how to read nutrition labels so that you can make informed choices where possible—say, looking to see if a food has a lot of saturated fats so you can consider opting for a similar option with less—is a great first step, she says.\r\n\r\n## On top of the basics, there are some nutrients you do need more of when you’re pregnant.\r\n\r\nFolic acid\r\n\r\nFolic acid is the human-made version of folate, a B vitamin. (Folic acid and folate are often used interchangeably.) The vitamin is important for pregnant people because it may help prevent defects in the neural tube, the part of the embryo that eventually becomes the baby’s brain and spinal cord.\r\n\r\nBecause these defects form in the early stages of pregnancy, guidelines suggest supplementing with folic acid before you even starttrying to get pregnant. If you’re thinking about getting pregnant (or are having sex with someone who can get you pregnant and are not using protection), you should be on it, Dr. Kamyar says.\r\n\r\nACOG guidelines recommend pregnant people get 600 micrograms of folate or folic acid per day. Since it’s hard to get that much from food, they recommend supplementing with a prenatal vitamin containing at least 400 micrograms of folic acid, starting at least one month before you start trying to become pregnant, and then continuing for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. For the other 200 micrograms, you can find folate in fortified cereal, bread, and pasta products, dark leafy greens, orange juice, beans, and peanuts.\r\n\r\nCholine\r\n\r\nCholine is a nutrient that plays a role in fetal brain development. Getting enough of it during pregnancy may help prevent some common birth defects, according to ACOG.The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services recommends pregnant people get 450 milligrams per day. It’s actually not very common in prenatal vitamins, so it’s important to make sure you’re getting it from the foods you eat. Chicken, beef, animal liver, eggs (especially the yolk), milk, soy, and peanuts are all good sources of choline. Potatoes, cruciferous vegetables Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower), and some beans, nuts, seeds, and whole grains also contain some choline.\r\n\r\nIron\r\n\r\nIron is a mineral that your body uses to transport oxygen in your blood. During pregnancy, your body uses it to make the extra blood you and your baby need. If you don\'t take in enough of the mineral,you can develop iron-deficiency anemia, which can make you feel really weak or tired. Recommendations suggest pregnant people get 27 milligrams per day (compared to the 18 milligrams recommended for non-pregnant women).\r\n\r\nYou may be able to get enough iron through your diet, though Dr. Valent notes that iron-rich foods—like red meat, poultry, and fish—may be tough to consume in large enough amounts. (These animal sources are known as heme iron.) Plant-based sources of iron (known as non-heme iron), like soybeans, spinach, and lentils, contain a type of iron that’s a little harder for our bodies to absorb than heme iron sources. Combining these foods with foods rich in vitamin C (likecitrus fruits) can help your body absorb the iron better. Also, most prenatal vitamins contain some iron to fill in the gaps in your diet. If you do wind up developing iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy, your doctor may suggest taking an iron supplement that has more of this mineral than a prenatal—and it\'s worth noting that iron supplementsmay cause a whole host of unpleasant GI symptoms in some people. While it\'s not always possible to avoid iron-deficiency anemia, trying to stay on top of your iron intake during pregnancy is a great call.\r\n\r\nIodine\r\n\r\nIodine is a mineral that your body uses to makethyroid hormones, which are important for fetal bone and brain development. Pregnant people should get 220 micrograms daily (up from 150 micrograms for non-pregnant adults).\r\n\r\nMost people in the U.S. get plenty of iodine because it’s added to table salt. But Dr. Valent says that since more people are cooking with sea salt and kosher salt, both of which are generally not fortified with iodine, it may not be easy for everyone to get enough during pregnancy. TheAmerican Thyroid Association recommends that all pregnant and breastfeeding people take a daily prenatal vitamin that contains 150 micrograms of iodine to make up for any gap you may have in your diet—dietary sources include dairy, eggs, saltwater fish, shellfish, seaweed, and soy milk.\r\n\r\nCalcium, Vitamin D, and Vitamin C\r\n\r\nVitamin C, calcium, and vitamin D play a role in building your baby’s bones. (In fact, if you don’t get enough calcium during pregnancy, your baby cantake what they need from *your* bones.) In addition, vitamin D contributes to skin and eye development, and vitamin C helps your immune system function properly.\r\n\r\nAll three of these nutrients are important during pregnancy. The recommended daily amount of vitamin C during pregnancy is slightly elevated from non-pregnancy, from 65 to 80 milligrams for people 18 and under, and from 75 to 85 milligrams for those 19 and older. Citrus fruits, broccoli,tomatoes, and strawberries are all good sources of vitamin C.\r\n\r\nThere’s no recommendation for increasing intake of calcium or vitamin D during pregnancy; it’s just extra important to make sure you’re getting the usual recommended daily amounts. For calcium, that’s 1,300 milligrams for those who are 18 and younger and 1,000 milligrams for those 19 and older. For vitamin D, that’s 600 international units (IU) or 15 micrograms. Fortified milk and fatty fish such as salmon and sardines are the best food sources of vitamin D. (Sunlight is also a source of vitamin D, but you should wear sunscreen whenever you’ll be outdoors for more than a few minutes, so getting enough vitamin D from food is going to be easier.) You can get calcium from dairy products like milk, yogurt, or cheese, or other foods like sardines, kale, and broccoli.\r\n\r\n## There are general guidelines for extra calories and weight gain, but it’s not an exact science.\r\n\r\nTucker says that while yes, you’re eating for two in a sense—what you eat gives your growing baby the nutrients they need, too—you don’t need to double the quantity of food you consume once you’re pregnant. In fact, your calorie needs don’t increase all that drastically during pregnancy, she says.\r\n\r\n“During the first trimester, you don\'t really have additional calorie needs, and then you only need about 340 more per day in the second trimester and 450 in the third trimester,” Tucker says. (Those ACOG guidelines are higher if you’re pregnant with multiple babies—about 300 more calories per additional fetus.) You can meet those needs by adding one or twoextra snacks throughout the day. Of course, everyone’s calorie needs vary depending on things like body size and activity level, so it’s important to think of it as 340 or 450 calories *more* than your non-pregnancy norm, rather than looking for specific numbers that all pregnant people should aim for.\r\n\r\nNavigating the calorie situation during pregnancy can be really tough, to say the least. “We know gaining too much weightabove the recommendation] puts someone at risk [for conditions like hypertension and [gestational diabetes]. On the other hand, trying to *avoid* weight gain with behaviors like crash dieting can also increase the chances of pregnancy complications,” Dr. Valent says.\r\nWhat constitutes healthy weight gain during pregnancy depends in large part on your weight going into it. For example, someone with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5-24.9 going into pregnancy should gain about 25-35 pounds if they’re pregnant with one baby, according to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The numbers are lower for someone with a higher BMI than this, and higher for someone with a lower BMI than this. The thing is that BMI is far from a perfect measure of health (more on that,here), and ultimately, a guideline is just a guideline. \r\n\r\nWhat\'s more, the weight situation becomes even more complicated since some people may actually end up *losing* weight in the first trimester due to food aversions, nausea, or vomiting. Plus, weight gain isn\'t exactly consistent through pregnancy, and some ofwhat you are gaining is increased fluid and blood volume.\r\n\r\nDealing with confusing pregnancy guidelines surrounding the already fraught topic of weight is incredibly stressful. Focusing on developing a healthy lifestyle and healthy pregnancy overall is paramount to worrying about specific calorie counts (and if you do have aversions to “healthy” foods, getting some fuel in you is more important than being strict about what you are eating). This broader approach can also be especially helpful if you have issues with or difficulty with tracking your weight and calories.\r\n\r\nThat being said, you should always work with your health care provider whenever possible to make sure what you’re doing related to food during your pregnancy is helping instead of hurting you. (Though some health care providers can be unhelpful and stressful when it comes to anythingweight-related, which only makes this more complex.) As long as your baby is growing properly on ultrasounds and you’re not excluding whole food groups or consistently deficient in any single nutrient, then you’re probably doing just fine, says Tucker. \r\n\r\n## It’s true there *are* some foods you should try to avoid during pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe following foods make this short list because they are associated with an elevated risk offoodborne illness or other potential risks to a baby’s healthy development. Foodborne illnesses, like listeriosis, salmonella, and E.coli, can make a person very ill and dehydrated, which can lead to poor pregnancy outcomes like preterm labor and contractions and even cause someone to pass out and fall, Dr. Kamyar says. Listeriosis, in particular, has been linked to more serious complications, including miscarriage and stillbirth.\r\n\r\nRaw and smoked seafood, raw meat, raw eggs, deli meat, hot dogs, and unpasteurized dairy\r\n\r\nThe reason experts recommend avoiding these foods is because they all come with a higher-than-normal risk of contamination. “Sushi made with raw fish can have parasites that can make you ill; unpasteurized milk products (like some soft cheeses, though you can eat pasteurized versions) can carry listeria and other diseases,” Dr. Kamyar says. Ditto with raw meat, smoked seafood, deli meats, and yes, even hot dogs. “The problem with hot dogs and lunch meats is that if they’re left out and not refrigerated and they aren’t handled hygienically, that’s when you risk infection with bacteria,” Dr. Kamyar says. It\'s also important to note that some conventionally “healthy” foods like sprouts, celery, and cantaloupe have also caused listeria outbreaks, theCDC says.\r\n\r\nThat being said, you could of course get food poisoning from other foods. It’s just that it tends to happen more frequently in these ones, so avoiding them is a realistic way to minimize your risk, Dr. Kamyar says.\r\n\r\nHigh-mercury fish\r\n\r\nFish is actually a really healthy food to eat during pregnancy. ACOGrecommends eating at least two servings of fish or shellfish per week to get a good dose of omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for your baby’s brain development. Fish is also a great source of protein, Dr. Kamyar adds.\r\n\r\nBut you want to avoid fish that tends to contain a lot of mercury, which has been linked to birth defects. These include marlin, shark, swordfish, tilefish, orange roughy, bigeye tuna, and king mackerel. Instead, stick to smaller fish, like tilapia, catfish, and salmon. Canned white (albacore) tuna is also OK in moderation—ACOG suggests limiting consumption to 6 ounces per week to be mindful of mercury.\r\n\r\nOther supplements besides prenatals\r\n\r\nExpertsrecommend taking prenatal vitamins before and during pregnancy, so that you can make sure you’re getting all the important nutrients you and your baby need. But you shouldn’t take that to mean you should load up on *all* supplements.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the currently very popular CBD hasn’t been well-studied in pregnancy—“we don’t really know what it does to a pregnancy,” says Dr. Kamyar—so that’s one supplement you should skip. Like other supplements, it’s also unregulated, so there’s no way to know what’s actually in it.\r\n\r\nEven regular multivitamins might not be a good idea on top of your prenatals. Dr. Kamyar says that some multivitamins may have high levels of vitamin A. Gettingtoo much vitamin A during pregnancy has been associated with birth defects in the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and spontaneous abortion. Of course, you need *some* vitamin A—it’s important most notably for healthy eye development. Dr. Kamyar says that as long as you’re not supplementing with it, and just getting vitamin A from foods like sweet potatoes and carrots and your prenatal, you shouldn’t be concerned about taking in too-high amounts.\r\n\r\nBottom line: Always talk to your doctor before taking any sort of supplement, no matter how natural and harmless it sounds, during pregnancy.\r\n\r\n## Experts also suggest cutting back on caffeine—and completely avoiding alcohol.\r\n\r\nYou may not need to *stop* your daily coffee habit, but depending on how much you’re drinking, you may need to cut down on it: Experts recommend limiting caffeine intake during pregnancy to 200 milligrams or less per day. That’s about the amount in one 12-ounce cup of coffee (thoughcaffeine content varies by roast and brewing method).\r\n\r\nThe reason? Experts know that caffeine crosses the placenta, meaning it can be passed onto the baby if the pregnant person consumes it. But research about just how much caffeine is OK before it may interfere with fetal development is inconclusive. There are also some concerns about a potential relationship between caffeine and an increased incidence of spontaneous miscarriage, but the studies done so far are, again, inconclusive. Until we know more, it may be best to stick to that 200 milligram max to be safe.\r\n\r\nAs for alcohol? Whileyou might have heard from a friend or a book that light drinking during pregnancy may be OK, both ACOG and the CDC strongly say that drinking any type of alcohol, at any time during pregnancy, can potentially impact your baby’s development and cause birth defects and lifelong behavior problems. That recommendation is not without controversy, though. Some studies, including a2012 Danish study of 1,628 women and their children at 5 years of age, have reached confusing conclusions, suggesting that low to moderate alcohol consumption (less than eight drinks a week) during early pregnancy may not ultimately impact the child’s brain function. On the other hand, a2013 *Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research* systematic review and meta-analysis found that, based on three studies of approximately 11,900 children aged 9 months to 5 years, moderate drinking during pregnancy (up to six drinks a week) was associated with behavioral problems. And whileprior U.K. guidelines limited alcohol during pregnancy to one to two units of alcohol once or twice a week—two units being the equivalent of a medium-sized glass of wine—they revised them in 2016 to show that no level of alcohol is safe to drink.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to caffeine, we just don’t really have solid research that confirms an exact amount of drinking alcohol is safe at any point in pregnancy (it’s not exactly easy or morally sound to do studies where a pregnant person drinks alcohol and waits to see how it impacts their baby’s health). Until we have more robust studies and concrete evidence on how much, exactly, might be safe, it’s safer to just not do it at all, Dr. Valent says. At the same time, some people find the guidelines of “do not drink if you might have the remote chance of becoming pregnant” paternalistic and overreaching. On that note, if you happened to drink a small amount of alcohol before you knew you were pregnant, serious harm to your baby from that is unlikely, according to ACOG—the best course of action would be to not drink more after learning of your pregnancy.\r\n\r\nWhile having to skip those cups of coffee—or turn down a poached egg for breakfast or your regular glass of wine with dinner—can be annoying, it can be helpful to reframe your pregnancy eating in your mind: Instead of looking at pregnancy as a time when you can’t have certain things, think of it as an opportunity to check in on how you’re nourishing your body. It’s a time to give your body what it needs to be healthy and grow another human—that’s pretty awesome, right? The bonus is that you’ll learn some great things about eating nutrient-rich foods and taking care of yourself that you can keep using beyond pregnancy, too. And on those days when even that change in focus doesn’t take away the sting of foregoing certain foods and drinks during pregnancy, the good news is that it won’t last forever.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:22:44', '2021-03-10 19:38:32', '/resources/images/preg_woman%2520healthy_eating.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/pregnancy-food-rules-to-follow', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (57, 11, 'How to Eat Healthy, According to 11 R.D.s', 'Here\'s how to get more nutrition and joy from your diet. ', '![woman eating donut](https://media.self.com/photos/5f490e4e4a75ee30a626683e/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/woman_food_donut.jpeg)Victor Espadas/Adobe Stock\n\nIf you\'re wondering how to eat healthy—how, exactly, to fuel your body and mind with the nutrition you need to feel your best—well, that\'s a great question. Many of us have some nebulous idea of what healthy eating is and is not, but when you break it all down, the actual logistics behind how to eat healthy aren\'t always easy to clear or intuitive. In fact, it\'s really freaking confusing sometimes.\n\nFirst off, there are a lot of opinions and information (and misinformation) out there, so it’s hard to know what to listen to. This has resulted in a really narrow view of healthy eating that is steeped in diet culture, which has skewed a lot of our thinking about what healthy eating advice should sound like. This diet culture-based messaging often pushes restriction and prescriptive rules that don’t take into account the personal, cultural, and socioeconomic factors that influence what a healthy diet looks like for any one individual. Connected to that is the assumption, largely fueled by fatphobia, that healthy eating is synonymous with eating to lose weight.\n\nIn other words: It\'s only natural to be anywhere from a little to extremely lost on how to actually eat healthy. So, for some guidance on how to expand that healthy eating definition, we asked 11 registered dietitians from a variety of backgrounds, personally and professionally, for their best tips on healthy eating that are flexible and empowering, instead of rigid and punishing. They shared practical pieces of advice that can make it easier for people to enrich and diversify the nutrition in their diets and make their own delicious, satisfying meals—as well as, just as important, cultivate a more peaceful and enjoyable relationship with food and eating. Take the tips that speak to you, and add them to your very own one-of-a-kind healthy eating toolbox.\n\n## 1. Reject one-size-fits-all diets.\n\n“Diet culture is inherently homogenizing with its wide, sweeping health recommendations and generic weight loss prescriptions. Not only are we incredibly diverse on a nutritional level, we\'re exponentially more complex on a health level. So if someone is telling you they discovered the right diet for most bodies, you can take that as a signal that this is not based in science and it is probably going to take you further away from yourself.” —*Lindsay Birchfield M.S, R.D., L.D., health and body activist and dietitian at* *Creating Peace With Food* *and* *Rooted Heart Health Care*\n\n## 2. Make sure you’re actually eating enough throughout the day.\n\n\"The most important aspect of healthy eating is whether you\'re eating enough. Sounds basic, but so many people are going long stretches of time without eating during the day, either because it\'s the latest diet fad, or because they get wrapped up in what they\'re doing. You\'ll feel much more alert and energized if you\'re eating something every three to four hours or so throughout the day.\" —*Rachael Hartley, R.D., certified intuitive eating counselor and owner of* *Rachael Hartley Nutrition*\n\n## 3. Focus on including more foods, not taking foods out.\n\n“Think about foods to add in rather than take out. It’s very popular and on-trend to want to consistently remove foods or food groups (like carbohydrates or fruit), but that will only make most people feel as though they are ‘obsessive’ with food. You can still eat what you like, but maybe think about adding some veggies on top of your pizza or on the side for balance, for example. I had a client who loved instant ramen noodles. I told her to keep the noodles, but add in some protein for staying power (such as grilled chicken, tofu, or beans) and throw in some chopped spinach and bell peppers for veggies. Adding in, not taking away.” —*Shana Minei Spence, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N., founder of* *The Nutrition Tea*\n\n## 4. Create a list of your values, then think about how well your relationship to food aligns with them.\n\n“This is something I talk about with every client, because it’s so insightful for understanding our motivations and behaviors. Some examples of important values might be: open-mindedness, honesty, respect, or kindness, among many others. Try to connect your actions around food or eating to your values to see whether they uphold them or not.\n\nFor example, if you value honesty but you aren’t being honest with yourself about your food preferences, there is tension there that may be harming your relationship with food or your long-term well-being. Additionally, if you value respect yet you are not respecting your body’s energy needs or cravings for certain foods, you may notice some opportunities to make changes. If you attempt this, be sure to stay grounded in a place of non-judgment; this exercise is intended to cultivate curiosity only without inflicting further guilt or shame for what you might uncover in the process.” —*Cara Harbstreet, M.S. R.D. L.D. of* *Street Smart Nutrition*\n\n## 5. Intentionally include social and cultural connections in your food experiences.\n\n\"If your idea of healthy eating only focuses on the nutrient density of foods and you find yourself thinking about food all day long, even when you believe you’ve eaten enough, you may be missing one or all of these key ingredients: pleasure, satisfaction, and social connection]. Expand your definition of healthy eating by including these key ingredients into your meal choices whenever possible.\n\nWATCH\n\nBeginner-Friendly Guided Meditation with Jessamyn Stanley\n\nTry scheduling a Zoom meal with friends or family while you reminisce on the good times. Recreate your favorite childhood meals to bring back fond memories and a pleasurable eating experience. Or for variety and comforting nostalgia, incorporate recipes and ingredients from your culture into your meals.” —*Ayana Habtemariam**, M.S.W., R.D.N., L.D.N., nutrition therapist and certified intuitive eating counselor*\n\n## 6. Describe your food in ways besides “healthy” and “unhealthy.”\n\n“Get creative with how you describe or think about your food. Typically, we’re used to thinking about food in organized categories like healthy or unhealthy, good or bad. But these labels can promote either an all-or-nothing pattern (where you think you shouldn’t have certain foods if they aren’t considered healthy or good) or a cycle of guilt and shame if you enjoy foods you consider less nourishing.\n\nInstead, I encourage you to get as creative as you can with how you describe your food. Make a list of as many descriptive words (spicy, savory, crunchy, melty, etc.) as you can. This can point you toward your true food preferences versus the food rules you absorbed from diet culture.” —*Cara Harbstreet, M.S. R.D. L.D.*\n\n## 7. Speed up your cooking.\n\n“Maximizing your time in the kitchen is so important, especially as we all are navigating uncharted waters. Using basic items like triple-washed and bagged greens or pre-chopped veggies cuts prep time in half. And brands like Brooklyn Delhi or Saffron Road have incredibly flavorful simmer sauces that bring life to any dish in under five minutes. A close friend just brought me some of the Brooklyn Dehli achar sauces, and I am a new convert—and the ingredient list is amazing.” —*Maya Feller, M.S., R.D., C.D.N. of Brooklyn-based* *Maya Feller Nutrition**,* Good Morning America *nutrition expert, and author of* The Southern Comfort Food Diabetes Cookbook: Over 100 Recipes for a Healthy Life\n\n## 8. Try mindful eating, even if just for a single bite.\n\n“Practicing mindful eating can help us reclaim some of the joy of eating, and allows us to discover our actual food preferences. Mindful eating is turning attention to the senses—the sight, smell, feel, and taste of a food. To eat mindfully means we take the time to really experience the foods we eat.\n\nI always recommend people start small, with just one mindful bite! So…to start, take a few deep breaths as you prepare to really taste your food. Take a moment to notice the color, the smell, the texture, and just take one bite. Take your time letting it sit on your tongue, chewing slowly, allowing your taste buds to take it all in. That’s all you need to do. You might notice that the food tastes different when you actually allow yourself to taste it.” —*Erica Leon*, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N., nutrition therapist and certified eating disorder registered dietitian*\n\n## 9. Add more fiber to your diet.\n\n“Fiber is integral to gut health. Not only is fiber responsible for keeping you regular, but it\'s also integral to helping your body colonize its good gut bacteria. Adding fiber-rich foods to your daily routine can be quite simple. Try an ancient grain like bulgur (which has almost 30% of the D.V. for fiber) or barley.” —*Maya Feller, M.S., R.D., C.D.N.*\n\n## 10. Don’t worry so much about “eating the rainbow.”\n\n“We often feel like we need to make our plates super colorful by adding veggies, but so many veggies aren\'t necessarily colorful. I think it\'s time to rethink that. Even if your plate is super monotone, don\'t worry—add the veggie that goes with the dish and will complement it. For example, I grew up eating Dominican meals, where we have a lot of root veggies such as yuca, yautia, and malanga. Not colorful at all, but loaded with nutrition. If you can, try new and different veggies, regardless of color.” —*Dalina Soto M.A., R.D., L.D.N., bilingual dietitian and founder of* *Nutritiously Yours* *and* *Your Latina Nutrition*\n\n## 11. Go for more regular ol’ veggies over trendy “superfoods.”\n\n“If you just do one thing, add more vegetables. Just regular vegetables. The majority of Americans don\'t meet the recommended daily intake for vegetables. And while it\'s fun to explore superfood powders and special drinks for better health, simply adding an extra cup of an everyday vegetable like roasted broccoli to dinner can help move the needle in a positive direction.” *—**Marisa Moore**, M.B.A., R.D.N., L.D., culinary and integrative dietitian*\n\n## 12. Skip the “healthy version” and eat the food you’re actually craving.\n\n“There is no need to compromise your taste buds with ‘alternative’ foods because we are told these are healthier—chickpea cookie dough, cauliflower anything, black bean brownies. When we are told we can’t have the real thing or feel that we have to ‘healthify’ everything, we then tend to think about those eliminated foods solely and think that we’re obsessed with or addicted to food. Instead, give yourself permission to eat the foods you like, including the foods you crave.” —*Shana Minei Spence, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N.*\n\n## 13. Seek out phytonutrients. (Ya know, plants!)\n\n“Phytonutrients are chemical compounds produced by plants, and are known to be beneficial to humans because they include antioxidants, which help protect the body from free radical damage. Fruits like blueberries are an excellent source of phytonutrients—blueberries contain anthocyanins and flavanols, which have been heavily researched for their cardioprotective capabilities. They can be enjoyed fresh or frozen and added to both sweet and savory meals. Or spice up your meals with garlic and onions. When stored properly, they have a long shelf life.” —*Maya Feller, M.S., R.D., C.D.N.*\n\n## 14. Eat when you’re hungry.\n\n“Your body is not on a timer. Eat when you are hungry. I’ve heard of some people being hungry mid-morning, but thinking that they shouldn’t eat because it’s not officially lunchtime. If you are hungry at 11 a.m., know that it’s okay to eat. Our bodies and their needs change daily (due to hormones, movement, activity, etc.). So just because you ate at 1 p.m. yesterday does not mean there is anything wrong with you if you need food earlier today. We are not robots or machines that go off of an autopilot, we are indeed human.” —*Shana Minei Spence, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N.*\n\n## 15. Batch prep grains and veggies, then mix and match them throughout the week.\n\n“This is a practical tip that makes it easy to build meals throughout the week without repeating the same recipe five times. Cook rice or quinoa and roast vegetables in bulk so you can easily add your favorite protein for a quick lunch or dinner bowl during the week. Mix and match to keep it interesting—toss the roasted vegetables onto pizza one night and serve alongside salmon the next. I also like to boil a batch of eggs at the beginning of the week to use for snacks and breakfast throughout the week.” —*Marisa Moore, M.B.A. R.D.N. L.D.*\n\n## 16. Create some new food traditions for yourself.\n\n“Food is strongly tied to memories and experiences, but when our eating habits have been strongly driven by diets or dieting, we tend to lose those traditions. Think back to some of your positive memories with food and see if you can either recreate them or replicate them in new traditions. This might be as simple as selecting a new recipe once a week to developing an entirely new way of celebrating major holidays. This can be an empowering and fulfilling way to celebrate food beyond its nutrition capacity and create a new food culture that doesn’t involve dieting or restriction.” —*Cara Harbstreet, M.S. R.D. L.D.*\n\n## 17. Add fresh herbs to basically everything.\n\n“The oils naturally present in fresh herbs like basil, parsley, and oregano add lots of flavor. Two tablespoons of fresh basil deliver about 25% of the Vitamin K you need in a day. And fresh parsley is not just a garnish—it’s a great source of vitamins A and C and an excellent source of Vitamin K. (Over 75% of the D.V. in one tablespoon!) Add fresh herbs generously to salads, make herbed vinaigrette to drizzle on fish, or add them to water.” —*Marisa Moore, M.B.A., R.D.N., L.D.*\n\n## 18. Keep ingredients for go-to pantry meals in stock.\n\n\"Keep ingredients on hand for a couple of tasty and nutritious pantry meals. That way, on days you don\'t have a chance to go to the grocery store or don\'t feel like cooking anything complicated, you\'ve still got options. My favorite is pasta tossed with canned chickpeas and frozen spinach sautéed with lots of onion, garlic, and chili flakes.” —*Rachael Hartley, R.D.*\n\n## 19. Delete or mute your food tracking apps.\n\n“This is one of the simplest yet most challenging tips. We can grow reliant on apps to guide eating decisions, but that creates a false sense of safety. That’s why it can feel so precarious to consider deleting them. This is one of the most important steps to reconnecting with hunger and fullness and learning to trust your body.” —*Cara Harbstreet, M.S., R.D., L.D.*\n\n## 20. Eat whichever meals whenever you darn well please.\n\n“Lose the labels. Ever notice how easily we categorize food into ‘breakfast/lunch/dinner’? This line of thinking can hold you back. A part of you is saying an ‘I can\'t…’ story, like ‘I can\'t eat this for breakfast.’ Some of my favorite breakfasts look more like lunch—a piece of hearty toast with mayo, tomato, basil, salt and pepper, for example. Likewise, cheesy eggs wrapped in a tortilla with any veggie I have on hand is a fast dinner go-to for me. Then I\'ll add in sides of fruit or my favorite bowl of cereal or dessert, depending on my cravings.” —*Rebecca Scritchfield, R.D.N., author of* Body Kindness\n\n## 21. Roast frozen veggies for an easy, delicious side.\n\n“I *love* frozen veggies. They can be super affordable and last a while in the freezer. My fave thing to do is to load up on frozen brussels sprouts, green beans, broccoli, peas, and carrots, and just throw them into dishes to add flavor and texture. The air fryer is my favorite kitchen gadget, so I roast a lot of these veggies in there tossed in olive oil, garlic salt, and Parmesan cheese. Or you can roast them in the oven until golden brown. Such a crowd-pleaser and super quick to make. ” —*Dalina Soto M.A., R.D., L.D.N.*\n\n## 22. Meal prep regularly, but try not to stress about it.\n\n“Have a reliable meal prep routine to avoid overthinking, which can lead to a downward spiral of unhelpful stress and anxiety around eating. And be flexible in what you consider a ‘good enough’ meal prep effort, given your time and money resources. For example, I try to set a 30-minute timer on Friday nights and have a notepad at the ready. I open up my refrigerator and freezer, toss the moldy stuff to compost, quickly prep any fresh vegetable that may be on its last leg (usually by sautéeing, roasting, or making a quick base for chili or soup), and chop up any fruit to freeze and use later with baked oatmeal or smoothies.\n\nAfter that sprint, I usually have several ideas for the next set of meals and favorites to restock. The time I invest in less-than-perfect prep ahead pays off in dividends when I\'m cruising through a busy week and all I need to do is reach for something that\'s practically prepped and get it on the plate. This actually gives me time to eat mindfully and enjoy the taste too!” *—Rebecca Scritchfield, R.D.N.*\n\n## 23. When in doubt, put some fruit and nuts on it.\n\n“Add fresh fruit to a scoop of gelato or sorbet, or fresh fruit and nuts (like almonds or peanuts) to a scoop of ice cream for additional fiber and protein to help keep you feeling more satisfied. I personally love adding mango, berries, and sliced almonds to my sweet treat. And I *love* blending granola and nut butter into my fruit smoothies. You get a mix of healthy fats and more fiber which will help keep you full for a longer period of time.

INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (58, 11, '10 ‘Healthy Eating’ Food Rules You Can Actually Throw Out Immediately', 'Who decided “Don\'t eat after 8 p.m.” made sense, anyway?', '![Mixed race woman holding colorful french cookies](https://media.self.com/photos/6001cbe80ea3ae085f6aa8f6/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/woman_macaron.jpeg)Lucas Ottone/Adobe Stock\n\nArbitrary food rules are ubiquitous in our society, thanks to diet culture and skewed views of what “healthy eating” actually is. These rules often manifest as specific commands and sweeping maxims about what, when, and how we should be eating. \n\nSome of these food rules are well-intentioned suggestions, and can indeed be genuinely helpful—to some people, some of the time—when used as guiding principles, as opposed to hard-and-fast rules. But a lot of food rules are, frankly, total B.S. They\'re unnecessarily restrictive, unrealistic, or unscientific—and, often, potentially bad for your relationship with food.\n\nThe problem is that rules are by definition one-size-fits-all, while we know that healthy eating is anything but. Our different bodies, nutritional needs, tastes, cultures, medical histories, food access, budgets, and lifestyles all factor into the best food choices for any one individual. So it naturally follows that rigid, generic rules about eating aren\'t going to work for everyone.\n\nWith that in mind, we talked to a few R.D.s about the food rules they wish people would realize they can actually toss out—or, at the very least, be a helluva lot more flexible about. We also asked them to explain why, exactly, they think these rules are worth ignoring (besides the fact that rules just suck). Get ready to add some items to your Things IDGAF About list.\n\n## 1. “Avoid processed foods.” \n\n“This rule is incoherent, and not necessarily helpful for making the best food choices,” Marina Chaparro, R.D., M.P.H., certified diabetes educator, founder of Nutrichicos, and author of *Diabetes & Pregnancy: A Real Guide for Women With Type 1, Type 2, and Gestational Diabetes,* tells SELF. There\'s a ton of hubbub in the food world around the word “processed,” but all it *really* means, according to the Food and Drug Administration, is that the food has been combined with at least one other ingredient, or changed in any way from its natural state (for instance: canned, mixed, cut, or pasteurized). So “unless you\'re eating a raw whole food diet where you don\'t cook anything, you are consuming processed foods,” Chaparro explains. That includes nutrient-rich foods like yogurt, whole wheat bread, almond butter, and smoked salmon, she points out. “Instead of avoiding processed foods, I would focus on teaching people how to read a label and not generalizing food as good or bad.” (Thinking about some foods as “good” and others as “bad” is essentially assigning food a moral value, which can make you feel like a bad *person* for eating something that seems “too processed” or otherwise unhealthy.)\n\n## 2. “Shop the perimeter.”\n\nIf you haven\'t heard of this food rule before, here\'s the gist: This grocery shopping principle is meant to steer people toward adding more produce and fresh foods in their diets. Those are typically in the aisles on the perimeter of a store, whereas other items (like packaged snacks and frozen foods) tend to be in the middle. Adding more produce and fresh food to your shopping cart when possible can be great. However, this rule also implores folks to keep packaged and shelf-stable foods out of their carts, Cara Harbstreet, M.S., R.D., L.D. of Street Smart Nutrition, tells SELF. “In reality, this is an unrealistic way to shop and cook for many people, who turn to the convenience, affordability, and flavor of foods found in the inner aisles,” she says.\n\nWhat’s more, “If you only shop the perimeter at the supermarket, you’ll miss out on rice, oats, beans, and so many other nutritious foods,” Marisa Moore, M.B.A., R.D.N., L.D., culinary and integrative dietitian, tells SELF. “Though I get the intent, it is limiting.” It also makes it seem as though frozen fruits and veggies—some of Moore’s favorite time-saving staples, located in the center aisles at her market—are not even worth considering, when the reality is that they\'re packed with nutrients and often more affordable than their fresh counterparts. \n\nThis rule is *especially* unfeasible in the coronavirus era, Harbstreet points out, when many people want or need to limit their trips to the store due to COVID-19. Her advice? “Toss this outdated advice and curate a shopping list based on what you need—packaged and shelf-stable foods included.”\n\n## 3. “Don’t eat after X o’clock.” \n\nSome people stop eating at a certain time because they’ve heard eating before bed is bad for you. But unless eating before bed gives you indigestion, it’s not really inherently worse for your body, as SELF has previously reported. More to the point is the reality that for many of us, our schedules are just not conducive to finishing eating by 6, 7, or 8 p.m. \"Many people are eating dinner very early and going to bed super late, so it is natural to need [food] because your body still needs energy while it is awake,” Dalina Soto M.A., R.D., L.D.N., bilingual dietitian and founder of Nutritiously Yours and Your Latina Nutrition, tells SELF.\n\nOthers implement a cutoff time to thwart their late-night cravings for snacky, “bad” foods. “The interesting thing is, this arbitrary rule might actually be contributing to your late-night cravings,” Vincci Tsui, R.D., anti-diet dietitian and certified intuitive eating counselor, tells SELF. “We all know that the more we tell ourselves that we can\'t have something, the more that we want it, right?” When you give yourself permission to head to the kitchen at any hour, late-night snacks can become less “naughty” and enticing.\n\n## 4. “Don\'t emotionally eat.”  \n\nThe fact is that eating often *is* emotional, Lindsay Birchfield M.S, R.D., L.D., health and body activist and dietitian at Creating Peace With Food and Rooted Heart Health Care. “We eat to celebrate and we eat to mourn,” she says.\n\nEating for emotional comfort is problematized, but in reality it’s a lot like most other coping mechanisms: a tool intended to help you get by, handle stress, and feel better. “[Emotional eating] is simply another way of seeking comfort when needed,” Kimmie Singh, M.S., R.D., founder of The Body Positive Dietitian, tells SELF. “Part of having a healthy relationship with food includes having permission to eat emotionally when it is helpful,” Singh explains, adding, “delicious food can be a great source of pleasure and comfort when experiencing painful emotions.” This is especially topical in the coronavirus pandemic, which has disrupted many people\'s dynamics with food in major ways, including limiting people\'s access to food, triggering disordered eating behaviors, and prompting many to seek comfort in the form of something that tastes good. \nThat said, eating should not be your only coping mechanism. Singh recommends seeking support from a mental health provider if you are struggling to access other tools. Finding a mental health provider who\'s affordable, accessible, and understanding in the way you need can be hard in “regular” times, much less right now. Here\'s some insight into finding the right therapist for you, a few more tips on that very subject, and some tips for having a good teletherapy appointment too. \n\n## 5. “Cook from scratch to eat healthier.”  \n\n“There’s this idea that in order to eat well and to be healthy, everything has to be made from scratch, and it’s just not true,” Moore says. Prepared, premade, and frozen foods can actually make nutritious choices more realistic for people, Veronica E. Garnett, M.S., R.D., Health at Every Size and Fat-Positive registered dietitian and culinarian, tells SELF. Garnett recommends “nutritious and delicious time-savers” like rotisserie chickens, quick rice, salad kits, and microwavable bags of frozen veggies, for instance. “When you feel like it and have the time, definitely make your scratch-made favorites,” Garnett says. “But know that there is absolutely nothing wrong with getting help from the grocery store.” \n\n## 6. “Don’t overdo it on the sugary fruit.”  \n\n“This is such a commonly held belief—that fruits are too high in sugar and must be ‘bad’ for you,” Erica Leon, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N., nutrition therapist, certified eating disorder registered dietitian, and founder of Erica Leon Nutrition, tells SELF. Yes, fruit contains sugar. But it also provides fiber and a variety of essential vitamins and minerals, Leon says—not to mention, juicy flavor. That fiber helps fill you up, while slowing the rate at which your body absorbs the sugar in fruit, Leon explains—which helps to keep blood sugar and energy levels more stable than, say, an equivalent amount of table sugar. Eat the fruit.\n\n## 7. “Drink a glass of water when you\'re hungry.”\n\nThirst calls for hydration; hunger calls for food. “This rule is used to suppress hunger, and while it may keep you temporarily full, the body will eventually figure out that no energy is coming into the body,” certified intuitive eating counselor Carolina Guízar, M.S., R.D.N., C.D.N., founder of Eathority and cofounder of Latinx Health Collective, tells SELF. And now you’re *really* hungry. “The longer you delay feeding your body, the hungrier you will be, and it can set you up for eating in a way that feels ‘out of control,’” Guízar explains. What’s more, “This habit has the potential to diminish your body’s trust in you to nourish it regularly.” So by all means, stay hydrated. But when you’re hungry, eat. \n\n## 8. “Always choose the whole grain.”\n\nWhole grains are an awesome thing to include in your diet—generally offering more fiber, protein, and hearty texture than their refined counterparts. But that doesn’t mean we need to condemn refined grains for eternity. “Eating regular pasta or white rice and not the higher fiber alternative doesn’t mean your meal is not ‘healthy,” Yasi Ansari, M.S., R.D., C.S.S.D., national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and assistant director of performance nutrition for UC Berkeley Athletics, tells SELF. If you really want the white bread, for instance, how satisfied are you going to feel after eating the whole grain one? Anyhow, what’s more important nutrition-wise is the balance of your meal as a whole. “There are a variety of ways to add more protein, fats, and fiber to your meal to pack in more nutrients,” Ansari explains—think beans, veggies, nuts, dairy, and meat or plant-based protein. \n\n## 9. “Cut your carbs.”\n\nIn the diet industry, macronutrients come in and out of fashion, even though “all of our macronutrients are vital for biological processes,” Birchfield explains. Recently, the influence of diets glorifying fat and demonizing carbs (like keto or paleo) has led to a broadly held assumption that fewer carbs are better, across the board. Not so! “Carbs are great and should be treated just like any other macronutrient,” Ansari says. “They provide us with efficient and easy-to-use fuel that our body needs for both mental and physical performance,” including essential body functions, daily activities, and exercise. Without enough carbohydrates from foods like grains, fruits, starchy veggies, beans, and legumes, “we run the risk of our energy tanking,” Ansari says—making it really hard to be at your best in daily life. And, Ansari adds, carbs often contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals your body really needs.\n\n## 10. \"Always sit down at a table to eat.\"\n\nPrioritizing sitting down and being present enough to really enjoy your meal can help make eating a more pleasant and meaningful experience, Guízar says. But, “While it would be nice for us to always have time to sit down and savor our meals, it is simply unrealistic to do this all the time,” she says. “The reality is that [some] meals will be messy and rushed, and that is okay.” If this sounds like your day-to-day, then don’t hold yourself to a standard that doesn’t fit your lifestyle, or makes you feel bad when you don’t meet it. Standing up at the counter, at your desk between Zooms, on the go as you head into work as an essential employee—”It still counts as a meal,” as Guízar says.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:24:16', '2021-03-10 19:42:45', '/resources/images/woman_macaron.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/food-rules-to-stop-following', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (59, 9, '40 Decluttering Tips For Your Apartment', '', '![img](/resources/images/shutterstock_1093498739.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe all deal with it at some point in our lives. Endless clutter can feel overwhelming, especially in small apartments. Instead of envying your clutter-free friends who seem to have it mastered, use these tips to whip your apartment into shape.\r\n\r\n## The Benefits of Decluttering\r\n\r\nDecluttering may feel like a chore reminiscent of our childhood. However, it comes with its benefits.\r\n\r\nNot only is it easier to clean your apartment when you’re clutter-free, but you’re also less stressed. Suddenly, you can find everything you need and your place feels amazing. Read on for our best tips to get you started!\r\n\r\n## 1. Declutter in Set Periods of Time\r\n\r\nTackling your entire apartment in one day can feel overwhelming. Instead, declutter in set periods. Set yourself a timer and work on one area for 10 or 15 minutes and take a break or call it quits until tomorrow.\r\n\r\n## 2. Regularly Donate Items\r\n\r\nDonating items is a great way to pass on things to those in need. Designate each week with a donation theme, from furniture to bedroom or kitchen. Drop items off or arrange a pickup from Goodwill or your favorite charity.\r\n\r\n## 3. Create a Decluttering Checklist\r\n\r\nInstead of spinning your wheels and jumping from task to task, use adecluttering checklist. Design it around a specific room or area of your apartment and check off your list as you go.\r\n\r\n## 4. Set Goals for Yourself\r\n\r\nGoal-setting can help you to tackle big decluttering projects and feel accomplished at the same time. Set goals based on volume. For example, tell yourself, \"Today, I\'ll fill an entire trash bag of things to donate.\"\r\n\r\n## 5. Manage Your Paperwork\r\n\r\nPaperwork escalates clutter and keeps piling up. Designate a day of the week to shredding and sorting mail and other items.\r\n\r\nTackling paperwork is also a good time to unsubscribe from catalogs, mailing lists, and switch to paperless billing.\r\n\r\n## 6. Stop Treating Your Home like a Storage Unit\r\n\r\nJust because your apartment can store something, doesn\'t mean it should. Clear out the things you don\'t use anymore. Sell it, donate it, and treat your apartment more like home.\r\n\r\n## 7. Take Before and After Photos\r\n\r\nDecluttering can be a long process, and the results aren\'t always visible. Take before and after photos to see your progress and stay motivated by the results of your hard work.\r\n\r\n## 8. Utilize the \"4 Box Method\"\r\n\r\nThe four-box method can help narrow down your clutter and create a system for what to do next. Grab four boxes and label them accordingly:\r\n\r\n- Trash\r\n- Give away\r\n- Keep\r\n- Relocate\r\n\r\nBut remember to follow a simple rule of thumb: If you haven\'t used it in a year, donate it or get rid of it!\r\n\r\n## 9. Ask for Help from Family and Friends\r\n\r\nWe can all use some support in our decluttering and organizational goals. Ask a family member or friend for help and turn it into a party. Listen to music, order pizza, and catch up before trading apartments and tackling someone else\'s clutter.\r\n\r\nYou can also solicit advice from your network over Zoom or FaceTime to ask how to tackle your decluttering goals.\r\n\r\n## 10. Try the \"One In, One Out\" Rule\r\n\r\nStudio apartments and small spaces need ground rules when it comes to bringing in more stuff. Every time you buy something new, commit to donating or getting rid of something else. Now there won’t be an excess of things in your apartment, and you stay in control.\r\n\r\n## 11. Try the 90-Day Rule\r\n\r\nTuck away your seasonal items, and then look at what\'s left behind. If you haven\'t used or worn the item in 90 days, consider donating it or tossing it altogether. Chances are high you\'ll never miss it.\r\n\r\n## 12. View Your Home as a Visitor\r\n\r\nView your home with fresh eyes and think about what a visitor would see first. Go through each room and make a list of what clutter is standing out and how you can resolve it.\r\n\r\n## 13. Get Innovative with Storage Solutions\r\n\r\nEven cozy apartments can benefit from small storage solutions. Hanging baskets for towels and socks can help declutter a closet or dresser.\r\n\r\nA plate display rack showcases your dishes and helps declutter your cabinets. And a pegboard helps you to hang gadgets, utensils, and other items.\r\n\r\n## 14. Rely on Technology\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of ways technology helps reduce your clutter and maximizes your apartment space. Scan old photos and give away or toss photo albums.\r\n\r\nSell off your DVD or CD collection and rely on digital solutions instead. The more you can store on your devices and in the cloud, the less cluttered your physical space will be.\r\n\r\n## 15. Get Multi-Functional\r\n\r\nCozy apartments need all the room they can get. So, keep your furniture multi-functional.\r\n\r\nReduce clutter with a coffee table or ottoman with hidden storage. Then, tuck away magazines, paperwork, and cords to keep them out of sight.\r\n\r\n## 16. Embrace Minimalism\r\n\r\nDecluttering is often about a mindset shift more than getting rid of your stuff. Embrace the idea of minimalism where everything serves a purpose, and you\'re free from cleaning and caring for so much stuff. Reduce the number of things in your apartment and enjoy the freedom it gives your life.\r\n\r\n## 17. Think Small\r\n\r\nOversized furniture isn\'t doing your apartment any favors when it comes to clutter. Reduce your volume of stuff by focusing on smaller pieces. Opt for love seats, smaller chairs, or padded folding chairs to make your living room feel more spacious.\r\n\r\n## 18. Use Your Wall Space\r\n\r\nPut your wall space to work to help you cut the clutter. Hang file folders and file away paperwork and other items. You can also ditch the television altogether and use a digital projector to watch television right on your wall.\r\n\r\n## 19. Reduce Duplicates\r\n\r\nHow many coffee cups, guest towels, and extra blankets do you need in your apartment? Reduce the number of duplicates and ditch the excess.\r\n\r\nKeep enough for you, your roommate, and a few visitors. Give away the rest.\r\n\r\n## 20. Identify Hidden Storage Areas for Clutter\r\n\r\nYour apartment is likely full of hidden storage areas where you can stash your clutter. The tops of your cabinets can store baskets and bins for mail and seasonal items.\r\n\r\nThe space above your bedroom door is also an ideal spot for an extra shelf for linens and towels to free up closet space.\r\n\r\n## 21. Commit to a \"Clean as You Go\" Strategy\r\n\r\nDrowning in clutter often accumulates from bad habits. Adopt a “clean as you go” strategy to wash up dishes, sort your mail, and throw out extra stuff the moment it appears in your apartment.\r\n\r\n## 22. Rent Your Stuff\r\n\r\nWhy buy fancy clothes, shoes, and accessories that you\'ll only wear once or twice a year? Rent them instead. That’ll reduce the items taking up valuable space in your closet.\r\n\r\nYou can also take the same approach with kitchen gadgets, photography equipment, and children\'s toys.\r\n\r\n## 23. Fold It Up\r\n\r\nMany things in your apartment can fold up and be tucked away for clutter control. Donate your kitchen table and attach a folding wall table instead.\r\n\r\nYou can take the same approach with your office space. Add comfortable folding chairs that can store easily and get to work without cluttering up your space.\r\n\r\n## 24. Use More Dividers\r\n\r\nSometimes we have more than enough drawers and cabinets but can\'t find our way through the clutter. Get organized with drawer organizers and dividers to separate the mess and make sense of what you need and what you don\'t.\r\n\r\n## 25. Host a Digital Sale\r\n\r\nSometimes we need a nudge to start a decluttering frenzy, like a financial goal. Host a digital sale and list your furniture, knick-knacks, camera equipment, dishes, and anything else of value on digital platforms.\r\n\r\nFacebook Marketplace, Nextdoor, and OfferUp are websites that can help you to get rid of your stuff and earn some cash at the same time.\r\n\r\n## 26. Hire a Pro\r\n\r\nSometimes, we can\'t get on top of our clutter without a pro to help. Hire a professional organizer to help you create systems and processes for dealing with your stuff. You\'ll walk away with a cleaner apartment and the ability to do it on your own.\r\n\r\n## 27. Designate a Clutter Spot\r\n\r\nIt can feel overwhelming to have no place to set down mail or paperwork you can\'t deal with yet. Designate a spot in your apartment, like a basket or bin by the door, to tuck away your mess.\r\n\r\nThen, pick a day of the week to deal with it. Make it fun by preparing a cocktail or specialty coffee when you deal with the junk to turn it into an event.\r\n\r\n## 28. Tackle the Smallest Projects First\r\n\r\nBig, audacious goals are admirable but are likely to fall flat. Instead of overwhelming yourself by decluttering your entire closet in one day, focus on the smallest project first.\r\n\r\nGain confidence in momentum every time you clear off a laundry room shelf or cabinet. Then, work your way up to the big closet clutter.\r\n\r\n## 29. Quit Shopping for a Month\r\n\r\nYour clutter will dramatically start to disappear if you give up shopping once in a while. Quit shopping for any extras beyond groceries and essential items for a month. You can repeat the process a few times a year and watch as your stuff magically becomes organized.\r\n\r\n## 30. Ditch \"Just in Case\" Stuff\r\n\r\nStop avoiding that box or drawer with all the \"just in case\" stuff. Random cords, hardware, washcloths, and gadgets should be tossed or donated. Your space will suddenly feel carefree again.\r\n\r\n## 31. Organize by Function\r\n\r\nFiguring out what to do with your clutter stops some people in their tracks. Start organizing each area by function.\r\n\r\nDedicate a shelf to toilet paper and paper towels, a drawer to toothpaste and extra toothbrushes, and a closet to linens. Organizing by function also helps you know where everything in your apartment is instead of wasting time searching.\r\n\r\n## 32. Incorporate Organization Into Your Design\r\n\r\nSmall spaces like studio apartments need an organizational boost to tame the clutter. Incorporate clutter control ideas into yoursmall space design. Start by lofting your bed and adding storage bins, bookshelves, or a makeshift closet underneath.\r\n\r\n## 33. Focus on Productivity\r\n\r\nBoredom and restlessness are some of the best times to declutter and getproductive. Whether you\'re dealing with the pandemic or are homebound on a budget, devote the extra time to getting a handle on your stuff.\r\n\r\n## 34. Document the Journey\r\n\r\nSometimes, we need inspiration, support, and accountability to make it through big decluttering goals. Document the journey on social media. Ask friends to share their best tips for keeping their apartments tidy and organized.\r\n\r\n## 35. Clear Out the Pantry\r\n\r\nWe often overlook our pantries when it comes to clearing out the old. Invest in air-tight food containers and get rid of old bags, boxes, and expired items hiding in the back of your pantry. You might even start saving on food when you can see what you have.\r\n\r\n## 36. Hang it Up\r\n\r\nThere\'s a play to hang nearly everything in your apartment. Shoe organizers can declutter bathroom bottles, hairdryers, and curling irons. You can clip boots onto pant hangers in your closet.\r\n\r\nFruit baskets can store food in your kitchen, mail in your hallway, or hand towels in your bathroom.\r\n\r\n## 37. Double Up Your Stuff\r\n\r\nMessy closets are challenging to tackle when there\'s simply nowhere else to hang up your stuff. To reclaim your space, double up and hang heavy coats over jackets. You can also clip two pairs of pants together on the same hanger to save on space.\r\n\r\n## 38. Clear Out Your Corners\r\n\r\nSqueeze out every inch of space you can by maximizing your corners. Clear them out and add shelving and storage designed to fit corners. Then, add bins and baskets to tuck away your unsightly clutter.\r\n\r\n## 39. Reward Yourself\r\n\r\nAll of that decluttering is hard work and deserves a reward once in a while. Once you\'ve cleared out your closet, replace it with a few high-quality wardrobe pieces or a new pair of boots to replace the dozens of items you tossed.\r\n\r\n## 40. Regularly Block off Time to Declutter Your Apartment\r\n\r\nDecluttering isn\'t a one-time event. Embrace it as a recurring event that\'s more like a marathon than a sprint.\r\n\r\nSet yourself a calendar reminder for once a week to tackle the clutter for as little as 30 minutes while listening to music. Then, devote a few times a year to a massive overhaul, likespring cleaning or a holiday purge.\r\n\r\n#### Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nDecluttering is more than just getting rid of stuff and staying organized. It\'s an incredible feeling to have more control over your apartment and feel more at home in your space.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:24:32', '2021-03-10 19:44:55', '/resources/images/shutterstock_1093498739.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/decluttering-tips', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (60, 9, 'How to Get Rid of Cockroaches in Your Apartment', '', '![img](/resources/images/images_jeshoots-com-__ZMnefoI3k-unsplash-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\nYour apartment should be your sanctuary, especially in these troubling times. That said, a cockroach infestation will certainly ruin your chances of enjoying your home.\r\n\r\nNo one wants to share their quarters with these pests. They can carry disease, cause allergy flare-ups, and make your home smell.\r\n\r\n**You’ll have to act fast!**\r\n\r\nIt’s imperative to understand how to get rid of roaches in an apartment, and, more importantly, how to keep them out. First things first, you should notify your landlord or property manager of the situation, and see how they can help out.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, cockroaches have a well-earned reputation for being both difficult to get rid of and seemingly indestructible. However, that’s not to say that once you have an infestation of roaches you won’t be able to drive them out. \r\n\r\nHere’s everything you need to know about how to get rid of roaches in an apartment. \r\n\r\n-What Attracts Roaches?\r\n-Signs You Have Cockroaches\r\n-Getting Rid of Roaches\r\n-How to Prevent Cockroaches\r\n-Final Thoughts\r\n\r\n## What Attracts Roaches?\r\n\r\nBefore diving into how to get rid of roaches, it’s important to understand what attracts them. Not only can this knowledge help you avoid them in the future, but it can also help you get to the root of your infestation problem. \r\n\r\nThese are two of the most common ways renters attract roaches. \r\n\r\n#### Food\r\n\r\nHome pests such as cockroaches need food to survive. Typically, roaches will be attracted to food in homes. \r\n\r\nThat’s not to say that you can’t keep food in the apartment. Of course you can! \r\n\r\nIt’s *how* you store food that can be a problem. If you leave food out for a long enough time, it will attract cockroaches (and potentially other pests). \r\n\r\nAnything from crumbs littering cabinet shelves to dishes left on the counter can act as a beacon for roaches. Food storage should be centralized in the kitchen, meaning that even if you eat a meal in another area of the unit, dirty dishes and leftovers should be promptly stored away and cleaned up. \r\n\r\n#### Dirty Dishes\r\n\r\nDirty dishes can also attract roaches. A few dishes left in the sink overnight won’t necessarily cause an infestation. \r\n\r\nHowever, a kitchen sink that is perpetually full of dishes with leftover remnants of food will certainly attract roaches. These dishes will inadvertently act as the consistent source of food that roaches need to thrive. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that dishes or food packaging such as pizza boxes or takeout containers left strewn about an apartment will attract roaches. Failing to maintain a clean and hygienic apartment will result in an infestation. Pests need food, water, and lots of places to hide. \r\n\r\n## Signs You Have Cockroaches?\r\n\r\nIf you want to act promptly and effectively bring an infestation to a stop, then it’s imperative that you know how to recognize the signs of a cockroach infestation. You can keep an eye out for any of these clues. They’ll help you stay one step ahead of your pests and get them out fast. \r\n\r\nHere are some signs that indicate you’re dealing with a cockroach infestation. \r\n\r\n#### 1. You See a Cockroach — Dead or Alive\r\n\r\nCockroaches are nocturnal insects. They often hide out during the day in dark, moist places. \r\n\r\nOften, they’ll invade the kitchen or other area at night when the lights are out. Turning on the light will cause these creatures to scatter quickly, hence the well-known phrase “scatter like roaches.” \r\n\r\nThat said, if you see a roach during the day, it’s a sure sign that you’re dealing with an infestation. This goes for all roaches, dead, alive, or unhatched. Roaches leave their unhatched eggs laying about. If you notice any brown pill-shapedcockroach eggs lying around, you may have an infestation. \r\n\r\n#### 2. You Notice Roach Droppings\r\n\r\nRoaches, like all pests, leave their droppings in conspicuous places. These tiny dark brown droppings will likely be left in clusters. However, even seeing a single dropping is a cause for concern. Be sure to deeply sanitize any area that you notice the droppings in. \r\n\r\n#### 3. Roaches Bring in a Musty Smell\r\n\r\nRoaches are also known for the distinctly musty smell they carry with them. You may notice a musty oily smell that you cannot find the source of, even after performing a deep clean. This scent will grow stronger as the infestation grows. If you have noticed this smell for a while, then it’s likely you have a significant infestation on your hands. \r\n\r\n## Getting Rid of Roaches\r\n\r\nOnce you’ve become aware of an infestation, you should act quickly to help ensure that it doesn’t continue to fester and spread. Here’s how to get rid of roaches in your apartment.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Store-Bought Traps\r\n\r\nThe first step to getting rid of cockroaches is to buy store-bought traps that are designed to attract and then kill cockroaches. Some of these traps work by poisoning food that the roach will then bring back to the other roaches. Others are simple sticky traps. \r\n\r\nOnce you’ve put these traps out on the first night, be sure to check them the next morning. If you notice that there are a ton of cockroaches on a single trap, then it may be a sign of a large infestation. \r\n\r\n#### 2. Homemade Traps\r\n\r\nIf you don’t want to make a trip to the store to purchase traps, don’t worry — making homemade traps can be just as effective. Here are some homemade trap options:\r\n\r\n- **Jar Traps:** These traps work to drown roaches as they approach the bait left at the bottom of the bottle or jar. You can utilize any sweet or fatty liquid as bait, but beer and wine are most frequently recommended. \r\n- **Duct Tape Traps**: Using a common household item, duct tape, these traps ensnare roaches on the sticky side of the duct tape. \r\n\r\n#### 3. Give Your Apartment a Deep-Cleaning\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most important steps as it can help you uncover your roaches’ primary hiding spots and help to eliminate their food sources. \r\n\r\nBe sure to deep clean with products that are proven to sanitize and disinfect. Roaches are disease carriers and can make you sick! Start in the kitchen and work your way through the rest of the apartment. \r\n\r\n#### 4. Exterminators\r\n\r\nAn exterminator should always be called in cases of a cockroach infestation. It’s impossible to ensure that you’ve driven them all out, even if you’ve carried out all the steps we listed above. \r\n\r\nThese professionals will use their tools and industrial-grade repellents and poisons to completely eliminate the problem. Be sure to contact your landlord before calling. That’s because they may require other tenants to leave the premises for an extended period. \r\n\r\n## How to Prevent Cockroaches\r\n\r\nIt’s always better to be proactive as opposed to reactive. Here’s how to prevent cockroaches in your apartment. \r\n\r\n#### 1. Clean the Apartment Regularly\r\n\r\nKeeping your apartment clean is one of the most effective ways to prevent cockroaches. This method removes their source of food and reduces the chances of them making their way into your home. Be sure to:\r\n\r\n- Vacuum All Areas\r\n- Wash the Dishes\r\n- Sweep Up Crumbs on Floor\r\n- Clean Out Cabinets\r\n- Ensure all Food is Stored and Sealed Properly\r\n\r\n#### 2. Seal Any Cracks in Walls or Flooring and Leaks\r\n\r\nCockroaches are known to get in through even the smallest of openings, so preventing them means removing any and all of their entrances and exits. \r\n\r\nAsk your landlord or property manager to look for any cracks throughout your unit (and the property as a whole). They should seal any holes or cracks to prevent future infestations. \r\n\r\n#### 3. Make Sure Windows are Properly Sealed\r\n\r\nSealing windows works to eliminate any entrances that cockroaches may have to your apartment. However, as roaches have the ability to fit through holes that are extremely small, it’s imperative to ensure that your windows are professionally sealed. \r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nCockroaches are not only a gross nuisance, but they can also pose a significant threat to your health. That’s why it’s important to maintain a clean apartment at all times and take preventative steps to significantly reduce your chances of infestation. \r\n\r\nIf you’re besieged by a roach infestation, talk to your landlord or property manager. They can help you get rid of the infestation and help prevent another one.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:25:56', '2021-03-10 19:45:34', '/resources/images/images_jeshoots-com-__ZMnefoI3k-unsplash-1024x683.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/get-rid-of-cockroaches', 0, 0);

However, bathroom germs and bacteria are everywhere. They include enteric pathogens, gastrointestinal viruses, fungi, and all the things you never want to think about again.\r\n\r\nReady to learn how to clean a bathroom? It\'s time to throw open the windows, air out the bathroom, and get to work with a serious scrubbing.\r\n\r\n-How to Clean a Bathroom: Supplies You’ll Need\r\n-How Often Should You Clean a Bathroom?\r\n-13 Steps to Cleaning Your Bathroom\r\n-Final Thoughts\r\n\r\n## How to Clean a Bathroom: Supplies You\'ll Need\r\n\r\n- Sponges and scrubbers\r\n- Paper towels or rags\r\n- Trash bags\r\n- Mop\r\n- Grout cleaner\r\n- Toilet brush and toilet bowl cleaner\r\n- Toilet bowl drop-in cleaner tablets\r\n- Air freshener\r\n\r\nIf you want to give your home a top-to-bottom cleaning, try using ourhousehold cleaning checklist in addition to these tips.\r\n\r\n## How Often Should You Clean a Bathroom?\r\n\r\nTackling how to clean your bathroom also requires a schedule. Most areas like your shower and sink need a once-a-week cleaning. \r\n\r\nHowever, you should wipe down a toilet that multiple people use every few days or more. Make a cleaning schedule with your roommate and switch off as needed. \r\n\r\nMake throwing out bathroom supplies and must-haves part of your cleaning routine, as well. Here’s how often you shouldreplace bathroom essentials like shower curtains and bath mats. \r\n\r\n## 13 Steps to Cleaning Your Bathroom\r\n\r\n#### 1. Scrub the Shower\r\n\r\nLove shower gels, fancy soaps, and shaving products lining your shower shelves? Remove all objects in the shower to reach all the surfaces. \r\n\r\nUse a mildew-fighting shower spray. Then, start scrubbing at mold, grime, and soap scum. \r\n\r\nIs your shower curtain full of mold and mildew? If you can’t scrub it clean, throw it out and get a fresh one every few months. \r\n\r\n#### 2. Clean the Walls\r\n\r\nTiles and grout attractbathroom mold with unsightly black spots. Your bathroom cleaner with a mildew fighter can help. \r\n\r\nOr, you can try one part bleach and two parts water. Then, scrub it into your tile and let it sit for 30 minutes. \r\n\r\nSkip the bleach solution if you have colored grout in your bathroom that could fade. Instead, scrub with a mold and mildew-fighting bathroom cleaner. Touch up cracked, faded, or damaged grout. \r\n\r\n#### 3. Clean the Ceiling\r\n\r\nRemove cobwebs and anything else lingering in the corners of your ceiling. Carefully clean black mold with 1/4 cup of white vinegar, two cups of hot water, and two or three tablespoons of borax. Be careful not to get the solution in your eyes. \r\n\r\nYou should report stubborn black mold to your landlord to avoid its spread and health problems. Black mold can cause breathing and respiratory problems for you, your roommates, and your guests. \r\n\r\n#### 4. Mop or Swiffer the Floor\r\n\r\nGrab your mop or Swiffer and attack your floors with a vengeance. Scrub the corners, look for mold, and throw your bath mat into the washing machine. Wipe down your baseboards and look for anything you missed.\r\n\r\nTake a moment to note any holes or damage around your baseboards. Household pests could use them as an entryway and spread to the rest of your apartment. Report them to your landlord to get on top of the problem quickly.\r\n\r\n#### 5. Clean the Sink and Vanity Area\r\n\r\nBacteria and grime can build up in your bathroom sink and create a health hazard. Give your sink a good scrubbing with a sponge to avoid scratching a porcelain or delicate surface. \r\n\r\nUse a bathroom cleaner to wipe down the rest of the vanity. Wipe out all drawers and cabinets around your sink.\r\n\r\nWhat’s going on above your sink? Wipe down your mirror and pay attention to the edges.\r\n\r\n#### 6. Clean the Toilet\r\n\r\nIt’s that moment you’ve been dreading! Get to work disinfecting your toilet with a toilet brush and toilet bowl cleaner. Work on all of the parts you hope you never have to touch again. \r\n\r\nAdd a drop-in toilet bowl cleaner once it’s clean. Only use an appropriate cleaner. Avoid flushing bleach or other chemicals down the toilet. \r\n\r\nClean all areas of your toilet, including the top, bottom, and the outside of the bowl. You can always wear gloves if this job grosses you out. \r\n\r\n#### 7. Wash All Bath and Hand Towels\r\n\r\nGather up your bath towels and hand towels and throw them in the washing machine. Give them a thorough washing and heat dry if possible to kill off germs. \r\n\r\nGot old towels with holes or other damage? Consider donating old towels or throwing them out and starting anew. \r\n\r\n#### 8. Dust Surfaces and Sweep or Vacuum the Floors\r\n\r\nBathrooms collect a surprising amount of dust. Dust your linen closet shelves, drawers, or other surfaces. \r\n\r\nSweep and vacuum carpeted bathrooms. Use a carpet cleaning product to touch up any stains or problem spots.\r\n\r\n#### 9. Wash the Windows\r\n\r\nGrab some glass cleaner and work on washing down your windows. Use a streak-free cleaner for the best results. Wipe dust and grime from the window sills and frames.\r\n\r\n#### 10. Disinfect the Door Knobs \r\n\r\nEver wonder what’s growing on your door knobs? Disinfect them with an appropriate cleaner. You can use a solution of vinegar and water to help remove germs.\r\n\r\n#### 11. Throw Out Old Medicine \r\n\r\nWhat’s hanging out in your medicine cabinet? You should throw old, expired medicine out. You can usually toss over-the-counter medication out in a Ziploc bag. \r\n\r\nPrescription medication needs a safe disposal method. Check theDiversion Control Division website to find a safe way to dispose of controlled substances.\r\n\r\n#### 12. Take Out the Bathroom Trash \r\n\r\nGather up your bathroom trash and dispose of it. Clean out your bathroom trash can or replace it with a new can. Add a clean trash bag that’s built for spills. \r\n\r\nAdd a can for recycling if you toss numerous shampoo bottles and other products regularly.\r\n\r\n#### 13. Deodorize with Bathroom Spray\r\n\r\nYou’re almost done! Deodorize your sparkling clean bathroom with household eliminator spray. Keep the door and windows open for a while to help circulate the scent and any residual cleaning smell.\r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nCongratulations on conquering how to clean a bathroom! Make a thorough scrubbing a regular event. And don’t be embarrassed if your squeaky clean bathroom is now your favorite room in the house.

I know, I know, we all do the basics: washing our sheets, taking out the trash, and scrubbing the toilet. But what do most people forget about? What items around your home haven’t been cleaned in years and are carrying unwanted germs? \r\n\r\nApartment List surveyed over 500 people to discover what household items are the most overlooked when it comes to routine cleanings. When viewing these survey results, please reference the following:\r\n\r\n**\'Most cleaned’** = % of respondents that last cleaned this item within the past few months.\r\n\r\n**‘Least cleaned’** = % of respondents that last cleaned this item a few years ago or never.\r\n\r\n![bathroom vanity](/resources/images/shutterstock_1141261541-1-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Bathroom\r\n\r\nOverall (and perhaps thankfully), respondents reported the bathroom is the most cleaned room in their home. When it comes to the most cleaned items *in* the bathroom, the bath mat tops the list. 89% of respondents cited the bath mat as their ‘most cleaned’ item (cleaned in the past month or few months). The bath mat is followed by the toothbrush holder and hair comb, with 85% and 84% of respondents reporting these items as ‘most cleaned’, respectively.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum, the least cleaned item in the bathroom is the scale. In fact, 28% of people haven’t cleaned their scale in the past year. Assuming the scale is a frequently used item for most, it’s important to give it a good clean.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to “most touched” surfaces, the bathroom door handle was the 3rd ‘least cleaned’ item for renters. In fact, 17% of respondents reported they have not cleaned it within the past few years or *never.*\r\n\r\nCleaning and disinfecting “most touched” surfaces such as door handles is essential for preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. So make sure you’re adding the bathroom door to your usual, and perhaps, in light of current events, daily cleaning routine.\r\n\r\n![img](/resources/images/shutterstock_416796661-1024x609.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Kitchen\r\n\r\nLet’s head to the kitchen, where the stovetop takes the crown for the ‘most cleaned’ item. 95% of respondents cited they have cleaned their stovetop in the past month or a few months ago. The stovetop is followed by the stove knobs and fridge handle with 87% and 85% of respondents, respectively, citing they have cleaned these items in the past few months *at least*.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the ‘least cleaned\' items in the kitchen, the ice maker tops the list. 28% of survey respondents cite they have *never* cleaned their ice maker. The fridge ice dispenser is one of thegermiest things in the kitchen, so make sure to get it cleaned stat. If not cleaned properly, ice makers canbecome contaminated with mold, salmonella, E. coli, and shigella. \r\n\r\nRemember friends, just because its only water in there does not mean the ice maker will avoid getting contaminated! To avoid getting you or your family sick, make sure to thoroughly clean the inside and outside of your ice maker on a routine basis.\r\n\r\n![Living room](/resources/images/nathan-fertig-FBXuXp57eM0-unsplash-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Living Room\r\n\r\nLet’s take a gander into the living room, the space we spend most of our time on the couch, hanging with friends and family. Well here’s some good news, ‘under the couches’ is the most cleaned item in the living room. In fact, 79% of respondents cited they have cleaned under the couches in the past month or a few months ago. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many people are neglecting cleaning their living rooms. 26% of respondents haven’t cleaned their TV remotes recently, yuck! The TV remote is another “most touched” surface and requires frequent cleanings.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the least cleaned item, the TV back panel is most neglected. 28% of respondents cited they haven’t cleaned their TV back panel recently or never have. It’s definitely overlooked, but could be quietly collecting germs. Get it cleaned!\r\n\r\n![Bedroom](/resources/images/logan-nolin-EvceCyopkKI-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Bedroom\r\n\r\nAll this talk of cleaning making you feel a little sleepy? Understandable… but first let’s investigate the cleaning routines of our favorite place: the bedroom. \r\n\r\nBed sheets take the top spot for the ‘most cleaned’ item, with 98% of respondents citing they’ve cleaned their sheets in the past month or a few months ago. I’m sure your significant other will be glad to hear that!\r\n\r\nThe ‘least cleaned’ items in the bedroom are the laundry basket and mattress with around 30% of respondents (32% and 30%, respectively) citing they rarely or *never* clean these items. You may be asking yourself, how exactly do you clean a mattress? Thisstep-by-step guide will walk you through the process.\r\n\r\n![img](/resources/images/shutterstock_1256513359-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Pet Items\r\n\r\nWoof, woof! Let’s not forget about our furry friends. Pet items need a good cleaning, too! \r\n\r\nThe pet bowl is the ‘most cleaned’ item, with 90% of respondents citing they have cleaned their pets’ bowl in the past month or so. Since the pet bowl is where your pet gets *most* of its meals (hey, we don’t judge for those occasional dinner scraps), frequent cleanings are a must. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it appears pet owners are not as diligent when it comes to *pet toys.* 31% of respondents say they have *never* cleaned their pets toys, yuck. Pet toys are constantly in your pet’s mouth or thrown around the house, so make sure to stick to frequent cleanings to prevent you or your pet from getting sick!\r\n\r\n## General Household Items\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to miscellaneous household items, the ceiling fan is the ‘most cleaned’ item. 71% of respondents cited that they clean the ceiling fan at *least* once every few months. Light switches and washing machines are also frequently cleaned. \r\n\r\nThe survey found light bulbs are the ‘least cleaned’ miscellaneous household item. 35% of respondents reported they *never* clean their light bulbs. Cleaning your light bulbs may seem tedious but improves the longevity of your bulb. In fact, dirty light bulbs shine 30%less bright than clean ones. So stop with the unnecessary replacements and get cleaning!\r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nAs we all try our best to understand and combat the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important to take a step back and rethink our daily habits. Developing a thorough, frequentcleaning anddisinfecting routine can help stop the virus from entering your front door. \r\n\r\nMaybe you turn cleaning into a new game with your roommates while ‘WFH’ (working from home), or kids while they’re home from school. Say, the first one to finish a room gets to pick tonight’s Netflix movie or take-out restaurant! We’ve heard some places are even servingadult beverages to-go...\r\n\r\nAbove all, it’s important to stay safe. But let’s have some fun with it!

But how do you know you\'re disinfecting properly and doing your part to stop novel coronavirus in its tracks?\r\n\r\n-The Difference Between Cleaning and Disinfecting\r\n-Disinfectant Products\r\n-Disinfecting Your Kitchen\r\n-Disinfecting Your Bathroom\r\n-Disinfecting Your Phone and Devices\r\n-Final Thoughts\r\n\r\n## The Difference Between Cleaning and Disinfecting\r\n\r\nThere\'s a difference between just cleaning your apartment and disinfecting it. TheCDC advises that cleaning is just the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities covering a service. \r\n\r\nCleaning your countertops may make them look sparkling clean and may help reduce the risk of spreading infection. However, it doesn\'t kill germs. \r\n\r\nDisinfecting uses chemicals to kill surface germs. However, it doesn\'t necessarily clean dirt or remove viruses. Instead, disinfecting should be used after cleaning to reduce spreading novel coronavirus and other germs.\r\n\r\nCleaning and disinfecting your apartment right now is crucial to staying healthy and stopping the spread of COVID-19.Research shows that novel coronavirus may remain viable for hours or days on surfaces. \r\n\r\nThe good news is, proper cleaning can help prevent COVID-19 and other viruses to keep ourselves healthy. \r\n\r\nStart your disinfecting mission by focusing on frequently-touched surfaces. Those are breeding grounds for the virus.\r\n\r\n## Disinfectant Products\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 is considered an enveloped virus, like SARS-CV-2. It relies on a protective lipid coating. \r\n\r\nYou can deactivate that coating with the right cleaners. Novel coronavirus is also easier to break down than many gastrointestinal viruses like norovirus.\r\n\r\nFortunately, common household products can help kill off COVID-19 and keep it from spreading. Disinfectant sprays, wipes, and bleach all make the list, but with a few caveats. Not all wipes can kill novel coronavirus. Also, many supplies are in short supply on grocery store shelves. \r\n\r\nThe EPA provides a list ofapproved COVID-19 disinfectants, but it does take some cross-referencing to ensure the active ingredients are listed. \r\n\r\nYou can also reference thiscleaning list to help determine novel coronavirus killers like Clorox Disinfecting Bathroom Cleaner and Lysol Brand Bleach Multi-purpose Cleaner.\r\n\r\n#### Homemade Disinfectants\r\n\r\nWhat if you can\'t find any of the products on the shelves? The CDC has a backup solution that most people already have at home or can easily find. Mix up a quarter-cup of household chlorine bleach with one gallon of cool water. Then, let it sit for twenty or thirty minutes on surfaces before drying it and wiping it away.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the stand-by bleach trick works well, it\'s not appropriate for every surface or room in your apartment. \r\n\r\nDon’t miss a spot! Use ourcleaning checklist to tackle your apartment from top to bottom.\r\n\r\n![apartment kitchen](/resources/images/shutterstock_1105740260-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Disinfecting Your Kitchen\r\n\r\nYour kitchen can be a hotbed of all kinds of germs. Here\'s where to start disinfecting:\r\n\r\n- Countertops \r\n- Anything with handles, including oven, cabinet knobs, and the sink\r\n- Cutting boards\r\n- Floors\r\n- Refrigerator shelves\r\n\r\nKitchen spills are common and not an emergency. However, you should clean them up immediately. Otherwise, the spill could further spread viruses and contaminate other parts of your kitchen. \r\n\r\nThe same thing goes for your dishes. Clean them immediately. Then, check to see if your dishwasher comes with a sanitized and heat setting. The more you can kill off germs, the better. \r\n\r\nIt\'s impossible to know what\'s festering on your kitchen hand towels. If they\'re old, go ahead and replace them by sealing them in a Ziploc bag and throwing them away. Otherwise, regularly wash them on high heat and dry them thoroughly. \r\n\r\nThe disinfectant journey doesn\'t end with the last paper towel tossed into the trash can. Take out your trash immediately and wash your hands. Then, clean out the bin, place a new trash bag inside, and rewash your hands. \r\n\r\nThe more you can mitigate the risk of spreading germs, the better.\r\n\r\n![bathroom vanity](/resources/images/shutterstock_1141261541-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Disinfecting Your Bathroom\r\n\r\nYour bathroom is the next place for thorough cleaning and disinfecting. Tackle your sink, and make sure to disinfect the fixtures and drain thoroughly. Remember to clean the areas around your sinks like the vanity, mirror, and shelves. \r\n\r\nGive your toilet a good scrub. Pay close attention to under the seat, around the rim, and the handle. Remember to clean the toilet handle with a disinfectant wipe regularly. Then move onto:\r\n\r\n- Shower and shower doors if you have them\r\n- Throw your bath mat and towels into the washing machine\r\n- Floors\r\n- Take out the trash and clean and disinfect your bin\r\n- Doorknob\r\n\r\n## Disinfecting Your Phone and Devices\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to your devices, bleach is not your friend. Clorox wipes work well to disinfect your phone. Apple recommends using a 70 percent isopropyl alcohol wipe todisinfect an iPhone and other devices. \r\n\r\nBefore you get started, turn off your phone and other devices and unplug them. Remove your novelty case or other covering to disinfect that too. \r\n\r\nA thorough job is always the goal. However, be careful not to get cleaner or moisture into your device ports. Dry clean those areas with a smooth microfiber cloth that often comes with eyeglasses.\r\n\r\n#### Other Things to Disinfect\r\n\r\nOnce you start disinfecting, you realize how many things you touch all day in your apartment. Take inventory of what you\'re touching all day, including:\r\n\r\n- TV Remote\r\n- Light switches\r\n- Door handles\r\n- All furniture handles\r\n- Keyboard, computer mouse, and laptop keys\r\n\r\nRemember to also clean your own clothes, bedding, throws, and blankets. Check the care instructions and place them in the washing machine. \r\n\r\nIf you can\'t wash them on your own, try to seal them in a bag away from your other belongings. That’ll help you avoid the spread of germs and viruses. Quarantining your own things and waiting for the virus to die over several days is better than doing nothing. \r\n\r\nResearch shows that viruses like COVID-19 are viable for 2 or 3 days. However, we\'re still learning something new about it every day. It\'s best to assume anything you seal off is likely infected for a week or more.\r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nRemember that all pandemics have come to an end and viruses do die. However, viruses of all kinds still circulate with ebbs and flows, making it important to clean and disinfect on a regular basis. When in doubt, clean, disinfect, and repeat your way through any health crisis.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:27:23', '2021-03-10 20:02:37', '/resources/images/images_shutterstock_215726422-1024x680.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/disinfect-your-apartment', 0, 0);

Fortunately,The NSF International Household Germ Study is here to remind us just how much we haven\'t cleaned — and the consequences. \r\n\r\nDid you know that studies show more than 20% of foodborne illness outbreaks result from food that was consumed in the home? Also, hidden germs and grime look gross scattered across your kitchen. With the spread of Coronavirus, now seems like the perfect time to start sanitizing.\r\n\r\nRoll up your sleeves and get out your cleaning supplies.

Fridge Water Dispenser \r\n\r\nThe NSF study says that yeast and mold thrive in areas like our water dispensers. Wipe down the visible surfaces with a clean sponge soaked in vinegar and water. You can also spray the mixture directly into the dispenser.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re confident about what you\'re doing, you can also take apart the water dispenser. Then, disinfect it from the inside out.\r\n\r\n## 2. Rubber Spatula\r\n\r\nWe hate to break it to you, but E. coli lives among us. Reach for those unexpecting rubber spatulas and get to work, giving them a good scrub. \r\n\r\nRinse them in hot water with a few tablespoons of chlorine per gallon of water. Vinegar and water will also work in a pinch. \r\n\r\nBut your rubber spatulas might be a lost cause. If they\'re still sticky after cleaning, throw them out. The synthetic or natural materials are often broken down by hot oils from your last apartment party.\r\n\r\n![Blender](/resources/images/shutterstock_419869516.jpg)\r\n\r\n## 3. Blender\r\n\r\nMixing up cocktails and smoothies in the blender is a perfect way to kick off the weekend. But you might also be adding a few extra ingredients like E. coli, Salmonella, yeast, and mold into your beverages.\r\n\r\nScrub out your blender with dish soap and hot water. Then, fill it with hot water and blend to get down into the gasket. \r\n\r\nIf possible, remove the gasket from the blender. Then, dilute vinegar and water for a thorough cleaning. \r\n\r\n## 4. Fridge Vegetable Compartment\r\n\r\nAre you using your fridge vegetable compartment as a compost bin? Although you cancompost in an apartment, the veggie drawer isn\'t the place to store it. You\'re probably growing Salmonella, Listeria, yeast, and mold alongside your veggies.\r\n\r\nTheCDC recommends throwing out old food and emptying your drawers. Then, scrub them down with hot, soapy water. A solution of one tablespoon of liquid bleach and a gallon of water can also help sanitize your refrigerator.\r\n\r\n## 5. Fridge Ice Dispenser\r\n\r\nDid you know ice dispensers can aggravate your allergies? The ice dispenser is a culprit for yeast and mold. That can make allergy sufferers sick. \r\n\r\nRemove and dump out your ice. Then, get to work with four cups of distilled vinegar and water into the ice maker and dispenser lines. \r\n\r\nAfter a five or ten minute soak, rinse, and repeat. The process can help break down yeast, mold, and lime that\'s building up a hidden germ factory.\r\n\r\n## 6. Fridge Meat Compartment\r\n\r\nMeatless Mondays may be the healthiest night of your week. Leaky meat containers and forgotten food are a recipe for E. coli and Salmonella.\r\n\r\nRemove your drawer, throw out the old meat, mix up a solution of one part vinegar and two parts water, and get to work. Remember to also scrub down any shelves where meat may have sat for even a few minutes. \r\n\r\n![Knife block](/resources/images/shutterstock_733997086-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## 7. Knife Block\r\n\r\nGetting your first knife block is a sign of serious adulting. However, it can also make you sick. Soap, water, and a mild bleach solution of a tablespoon of bleach to every gallon of water can help. \r\n\r\nAnd if you\'re in the market for a new knife block, opt for a product that doesn\'t involve wood slots. They\'re likely holding onto bacteria and other unwelcome guests. \r\n\r\n## 8. Food Storage Containers\r\n\r\nFood storage is key to a clean kitchen. It can make us feel like we\'re winning at the organized fridge game. But those food storage containers with rubber seals also lock in Salmonella, yeast, and mold. \r\n\r\nA vinegar and water solution can help, but you may need new food storage containers.NSF certified products and systems can help solve your food storage problems. \r\n\r\n## 9. Can Opener\r\n\r\nTake a closer look at your can opener before you pop open that next can of beans. Tiny food particles can get caught in the blade. That turns your can opener into a germ factory. \r\n\r\nYou can scrub down handheld can openers with a toothbrush and dishwashing detergent to get the grooves clean. If possible, remove the blade from an electric can opener. Then, use a toothbrush dipped in vinegar to clean out the residue. \r\n\r\nMake sure to dry your can opener to prevent rust. Also, be careful not to cut yourself on the blades.\r\n\r\n## 10. Fridge-Insulating Seal\r\n\r\nThere\'s a germ party going on in your fridge insulating seal. E. coli, Salmonella, yeast, and listeria may all be lingering around your fridge insulating seal.\r\n\r\nThe often-forgotten fridge-insulating seal takes some creativity to clean. Mix a half-teaspoon of dishwashing detergent in a cup of warm water. Then, scrub with a rag or soft toothbrush. \r\n\r\nTreat mold on the seal with a solution of chlorine bleach and warm water. \r\n\r\nWhether you\'re inspired or thoroughly disgusted, it\'s time to clean those forgotten, germiest things in your kitchen. Your place will never feel so clean. You\'ll get a good night\'s rest knowing you\'re germ-free.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:28:14', '2021-03-10 20:03:14', '/resources/images/images_shutterstock_793913143-1024x683.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/germiest-things-in-kitchen', 0, 0);

However, that can vary depending on the location and size of your item. \r\n\r\nIt’s important to ask your landlord if you’re permitted to leave any items outside of your apartment complex. That’s especially the case if you live in a large building. \r\n\r\nChances are, you’ll need to be home for a furniture pick up. However, you can coordinate with neighbors if you’re not available. \r\n\r\n#### 2. Donate Quality Furniture\r\n\r\nDonated furniture typically needs to be in decent shape. It’ll need to be free of stains, rips, and other damage. It’s wise to let the charity know about the condition of your furniture donation before they come. That way, you can make sure it’s acceptable.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Write Off Your Furniture Donation\r\n\r\nYou can write off a furniture donation on your taxes. Ask the charity about a tax receipt or other paperwork to use for tax time. That can help you to keep more money in your pocket.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Give Stuff Away For Free\r\n\r\nStill can’t find a charity that will accept your furniture donation? Try a site likeFreecycle. \r\n\r\nThis grassroots nonprofit helps people give away their stuff for free to help divert reusable goods from landfills. Freecycle is also a fantastic way todeclutter your apartment and give away stuff charities won’t typically take. That includes items ranging fromcompost to fabric scraps.\r\n\r\n#### 5. Pay it Forward\r\n\r\nWhen you schedule a furniture donation pick up, everyone wins.

That telltale black mold in the bathroom inevitably greets us all. It\'s tempting to ignore it and hope it goes away. However, the best line of defense with black mold in the bathroom is cleaning it and trying to prevent it.\r\n\r\nReady to roll up your sleeves and get rid of mold in the bathroom? Here\'s what to know.\r\n\r\n-How Does Bathroom Mold Grow?\r\n-How to Spot Mold in Bathrooms\r\n-How to Tell if it\'s Black Mold or Mildew\r\n-How to Clean Bathroom Mold\r\n-Dangers of Black Mold\r\n\r\n## How Does Bathroom Mold Grow?\r\n\r\nBathrooms are a prime breeding ground for mold to grow and thrive. It\'s easy for moisture to get trapped in your bathroom and hang around after a hot shower. The small space and lack of ventilation in a bathroom can also cause bathroom mold to show up and linger. \r\n\r\nLeaky toilets, sinks, and cellulose materials like wallpaper can also encourage mold in bathrooms to grow. Sometimes you can do everything possible and still find black mold in the bathroom that won\'t go away. \r\n\r\n## How to Spot Mold in Bathrooms\r\n\r\nBlack mold in a bathroom isn\'t always easy to see. Check under: \r\n\r\n- Your sink vanity\r\n- Around the toilet \r\n- The shower doors \r\n- The ventilation fan\r\n\r\nMold on the bathroom ceiling is also easy to miss. Get on a ladder and look behind the tops of your blinds and curtains. Also, check your light fixtures.\r\n\r\nIt can be tempting to just paint over mold on the bathroom ceiling. However, black mold is stubborn. It’s likely to grow back or grow through your paint.\r\n\r\n## How to Tell if it\'s Black Mold or Mildew\r\n\r\nPeople often confuse mildew for black mold in the bathroom. However, there are some key differences. \r\n\r\nMildew is usually white, gray, or yellow. It’s soft and powdery to the touch. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, black mold in the bathroom is often green or black. It starts growing beneath moist surfaces and can look fuzzy. \r\n\r\nYou might also find bathroom mold is slimy to the touch. That’ll promptly gross you out.\r\n\r\nBlack mold and mildew are both unsightly. You can clean either one the same way. However, the mold in the bathroom is often more problematic. It can cause health issues.\r\n\r\n## How to Clean Bathroom Mold\r\n\r\nThere are a few different ways to clean bathroom mold. The important thing is to remove the black mold and clean your bathroom. However, you need to approach it correctly. Otherwise, you could end up ruining your walls. \r\n\r\nBefore you get started,take a few photos of the issue. Remember to snap a few photos of the mold on the ceiling. This way, you can easily monitor the black mold and have documentation for your landlord. \r\n\r\n#### Cleaning Mold Off of Tiled Walls\r\n\r\nThrow open the windows, turn on the ventilation fan, and wear a face mask. It\'s time to break out the bleach. \r\n\r\nAdd one part bleach and two parts water. Next, scrub down any tiled walls that do not have colored grout. You could cause the grout pigment to fade. \r\n\r\nUse a hard brush to work your bleach solution into the tile. Then, rinse it thoroughly after 30 minutes. \r\n\r\nYou can skip the bleach solution and opt for a bathroom cleaner with mold and mildew remover. Just don\'t flush bleach down the toilet. That could cause a dangerous chemical reaction.\r\n\r\nBleach can produce an overwhelming odor and be challenging to manage. Instead, you can also use a one-part vinegar, two-part water solution. \r\n\r\nSpray that directly onto the mold. Then, let it sit for 30 minutes before scrubbing with a hard brush. \r\n\r\n#### Cleaning Mold Off of Wallpaper or Painted Walls\r\n\r\nAttacking wallpaper and painted walls or ceilings with bleach could ruin your surfaces. Instead, mix up a solution that includes: \r\n\r\n- 1/4 cup of white vinegar \r\n- two cups of hot water\r\n- two or three tablespoons of borax\r\n\r\nSpray onto the black mold. Then, let it sit for 10 to 20 minutes before scrubbing and wiping dry. \r\n\r\nIf you\'re nervous that your wallpaper is too damp, you should continue patting it dry every 10 minutes or so.\r\n\r\n## Dangers of Black Mold\r\n\r\nSo what\'s the big deal with black mold? Black mold is more than just an eyesore that looks harmless. \r\n\r\nIt can actually impair your health and well-being.Inhaling or touching black mold could:\r\n\r\n- Create an allergic reaction\r\n- Trigger an asthma attack in some people\r\n- Cause shortness of breath\r\n- Put infants, children, elderly, and those with compromised immune systems and lung disease at higher risk\r\n- Some black mold in the bathroom turns into Stachybotrys Chartarum, which is highly toxic and requires removal from a professional\r\n\r\nSome people may not suffer a reaction from black mold. However, it can put everyone who enters your apartment at a health risk. \r\n\r\nRemoving and adequately cleaning for black mold can help reduce complications. It can also make your bathroom look cleaner. \r\n\r\n#### Mold in Bathrooms: Is it the Landlord\'s Responsibility?\r\n\r\nMany renters feel their landlords should deal with black mold, or are legally required to do so. There are currently no federal laws that specify a landlord must deal with black mold.\r\n\r\nSome states and cities have mold regulations. Check with yourstate department of environmental protection and the statedepartment of public health to find out more. \r\n\r\nThere is also some grey area about the landlord\'s responsibility with mold. The landlord is required to provide safe and livable housing. As a result, you might be able to persuade them to deal with the issue. \r\n\r\nCheck your lease terms to see if it specifically references mold or mildew. It\'s also just good practice to loop your landlord into the black mold issue. \r\n\r\nYour landlord may surprise you and volunteer to remove it promptly. It\'s also essential to document the frequency of mold. That way, your landlord can monitor the situation.\r\n\r\nWith a proactive approach, you can eliminate bathroom mold before it gets out of control. Clean, monitor, communicate with your landlord, and repeat!', 0, '2021-03-09 20:29:14', '2021-03-10 20:04:24', '/resources/images/images_shutterstock_532074880-1024x683.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/bathroom-mold', 0, 0);

You\'ve been settled in for a couple of weeks... everything is going great. That is until you start noticing the dust on your dresser starting to pile up, and grime in your sink becoming apparent.\r\n\r\nIt\'s probably time for a deep cleaning.

INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (69, 9, 'How Often Do You Need to Replace Your Bathroom Essentials?', '', '![img](/resources/images/images_oval-mirror-near-toilet-bowl-1910472-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\nYou know that saying, \"Out with the old and in with the new?\" We\'re pretty sure it all started when someone stepped into their bathroom in horror and realized nothing was less than a year old except their toilet paper.\r\n\r\nBefore you toss all your bathroom items into one giant garbage bag and start over from scratch, read up on when you should throw out those bathroom must-haves, from toilet brushes to makeup.\r\n\r\n-Bathroom Essentials\r\n-Personal Hygiene Items\r\n-Skincare\r\n-Makeup\r\n-Medications and Supplies\r\n-Words of Advice\r\n\r\n![bathroom essentials](/resources/images/shutterstock_420206308-1024x714.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Bathroom Essentials\r\n\r\nLet\'s kick off the bathroom items list by scrutinizing your must-haves.\r\n\r\n**Toilet Brush** - Science says we should toss our toilet brushes every six months in between safe,baby-proof cleanings. Okay, it\'s not science, but just good common sense to throw out your toilet brush when it\'s too gross to keep in your apartment. You should toss it after a bout of a stomach bug or if it’s been six months. \r\n\r\n**Shower Curtain** - Steam, soap scum, and post-party funk can start to make your shower curtain look dingy and dirty. Add a liner to your shower and scrub it down every few months. Throw a fabric shower curtain in the wash every three or four months. \r\n\r\n**Showerheads and Filters** - Ever wonder how much grime is shooting out of your showerheads and onto your head? If you\'re nervously patting your head right now, you\'re not alone. You probably need to replace your shower head cartridge every six months to a year. It depends on the manufacturing and how often you shower. \r\n\r\n**Bathroom Mat or Rug** - It may come as a shock, but you only need to replace bathroom items like mats once every year or two. It depends on how well you clean it. Wash it once a week with your towels unless you and your roomie have filthy feet. \r\n\r\n**Bathroom Sponges** - Your kitchen sponges that sit around collecting germs are likely dirtier than your toilet. Meanwhile, tidying up your bathroom once in a while isn\'t a cause for alarm to toss all your sponges. Toss those bathroom sponges once every three months unless you keep funky bathroom habits.\r\n\r\n**Bathtub** - Did you know you actually need to replace a bathtub once in a while? If your tub looks like it came from a junkyard, ask your landlord if it\'s been replaced in the last 10 to 15 years. If it\'s been a decade or more, it\'s time. \r\n\r\n**Bathroom Scale Battery** - Have you noticed how everyone keeps the scale in the bathroom so we can shed extra ounces along with extra clothes? If your scale is acting up, try swapping out the batteries. The rule of thumb is every three years for alkaline batteries or 10 years for lithium.\r\n\r\n![towels, loofah and brush](/resources/images/shutterstock_1569849529-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Personal Hygiene Items\r\n\r\nAdulting is all about admitting we can\'t wipe our hands on our pants anymore and using a bath mat instead of tracking water through our apartment. Here\'s what to replace to keep your personal hygiene habits in check.\r\n\r\n**Hand Towels** - Do you creatively turn bathroom items like towels on their bar, so no one notices they\'re permanently stained, frayed, and torn? Time to change them. Otherwise, replace them every two years. Wash them every few days to keep germs at bay.\r\n\r\n**Bath Towels** - It turns out, we should replace our towels before they\'re so threadbare they resemble toilet paper. Try replacing bathroom items like towels every two to three years. That is, unless they\'re exceptionally thin or dingy. In that case, upgrade yourself to guest towel status and dry yourself in luxury.\r\n\r\n**Loofah -** You know that fabulous loofah that made you feel like you were on Oprah\'s Favorite Things? Well, if that was longer than a month ago, you need to replace it. Mold is also a deal-breaker at any point, especially if you\'re Oprah.\r\n\r\n**Toothbrush** - Follow the American Dental Association’s (ADA) advice. Toss your toothbrush every three to four months, or sooner if the bristles are frayed. We also recommend throwing out any toothbrush you suspect your roomie mistakenly used after a late night on a pub crawl. \r\n\r\n**Razor Blades** - There\'s no hard and fast rule about when to throw out razor blades.  Watch for nicking of the skin, pulling, or lots of gunk piling up. A subscription box of your favorite blades can also help you remember and make your skin feel amazing.\r\n\r\n**Hairbrushes and Combs** - It\'s easy to ignore the mess going on with your brush or comb when it\'s shoved into a drawer with other bathroom items. Clean your hair tools once a week or sooner if your hair is long or full of products. Otherwise, toss those hairbrushes and combs about every six months.\r\n\r\n**Contact Lens Case** - The health of your eyes is contingent on where you store your contact lenses. Contact lens cases may look durable. However, the American Optometric Association recommends replacing them within three months. \r\n\r\n**Clothes** - Clothes can last indefinitely. So, you don’t need to replace them until you\'re ready or need an excuse to reinvent your wardrobe. Unless you just wore a sweatshirt for a quick errand, it\'s best to wash your clothes after every wash. And who are we kidding, those bras are only going to get washed after every three or four uses. That’s generally okay if you\'re not working up a New Year\'s resolution sweat.\r\n\r\n![skincare products](/resources/images/shutterstock_556892884-1024x685.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Skincare Products\r\n\r\nIt seems like people are pretty good about investing in skincare. However, many are less conscientious about throwing out those washes and creams that are older than our last relationship. Here\'s how to approach your \"toss the skincare\" routine. \r\n\r\n**Face Wash** - Do facial cleaners even expire when they\'re designed to... well, clean? It\'s time to throw out your facial cleanser if it suddenly smells weird. It’s also time to toss it if it’s now a different color or texture than when you bought it, or it feels *off*.\r\n\r\n**Soap** - Here\'s some good news for hoarders who love to hold onto those fancy bars of soap. Use them up now. A well-drained bar of soap lasts about a month before it starts breaking down and getting slippery. That can make your bathroom items look gross by association.\r\n\r\n**Shampoo** - Did you score an apartment with lots of linen closet space? You can stock it with shampoo and leave it untouched for a few years. However, once it\'s open, you should toss it within 18 months. \r\n\r\n**Creams** - Creams don\'t just feel amazing on our skin. Those bottles and jars make our bathroom look like a spa. Instead of holding onto these bathroom items indefinitely, throw them away within a year. You may need to toss them sooner if your skin starts to feel itchy. You can also squash those temptations by knowing those open jars can breed bacteria and transfer to your face. \r\n\r\n![Makeup brushes](/resources/images/jamie-street-aMuq-Xz7R_M-unsplash-1024x663.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Makeup\r\n\r\nWe all want to look our best strolling through the neighborhood or bar-hopping across the city. However, experts say we still need to toss that makeup before it gives us a funky rash or bacterial infection. \r\n\r\n**Mascara** - Love pumping up your non-existent eyelashes with mascara? Replace your tube of mascara every three months to avoid red eyes and bacterial infections.\r\n\r\n**Eyeliner** - Mascara and eyeliner usually go hand in hand. They should also journey into the trash can together with other bathroom items. Throw out that eyeliner every three months. That’ll help keep your eyes looking healthy and fresh.\r\n\r\n**Foundation** - Foundation gives your skin an even, glowing look. You can use the same bottle for about a year. Throw it out sooner if the consistency changes or you suddenly notice an unpleasant skin reaction.\r\n\r\n**Lipstick** - Worried that we\'re going to insist you toss your super special lipstick? You can keep it for about a year after its first use. However, you can stretch that a bit if the consistency and color are still holding up.\r\n\r\n**Blushes** - Transform your sunless, wintry face with some blush for up to two years after its first use. Then, toss it and find something else to brighten up those cheeks.\r\n\r\n**Eyeshadows** - Like blushes, eyeshadows can usually stick around your bathroom for about two years after their first use. You might want to toss them sooner if you\'re reusing the same old makeup brush or digging your fingers in to scoop out those last powdery bits.\r\n\r\n**Makeup Brushes** - Makeup brushes may keep your face look flawless, but need some upkeep. Maintain them, clean them, then toss them about every three months with your other bathroom items.\r\n\r\n![Medicine cabinet](/resources/images/shutterstock_371789245-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Medications and Supplies\r\n\r\nLet\'s all vow to not be those grown-ups who keep cough syrup that\'s five or six years old around in case of an emergency. Here\'s what to do about those old meds and supplies.\r\n\r\n**Medication** - Unlike a bag of chips that you can probably still eat after the expiration date, you need to toss expired medications immediately. You could risk popping a few pills whose composition has changed and is now too strong or too weak. Then, you may not understand how it\'s impacting your body. Just say no.\r\n\r\n**First Aid Kit** - Remember how you felt like such a grown-up after getting that first aid kit? Now you can go adulting every few months by checking on what’s inside that kit. Make sure any pain relievers are still current, supplies are in good shape, and any flashlight batteries are still working.\r\n\r\n## Three Words of Advice\r\n\r\nWhen in doubt about bathroom items, our advice is, “**toss, replace, and repeat.**” If not for yourself, do it for your roommate, who has to live with the hand towels you haven\'t replaced since graduating college.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:30:45', '2021-03-10 20:06:49', '/resources/images/images_oval-mirror-near-toilet-bowl-1910472-1024x683.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/when-to-replace-bathroom-essentials', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (70, 9, 'Guide to Cleaning the House Safely for Your Baby', '', '![img](/resources/images/images_photo-1554344462-4d4ef7ecabc1-1024x683.jpeg)\r\n\r\nKristin Brown @kristinbrownphotography from Unsplash\r\n\r\nA lot changes when a baby enters your life, even things that might not be obvious at first. Yes, you have another human you are now responsible for, another person living in your home, a baby to love and tend to. However, as a new parent, you may not have thought extensively about how you have to change your home to make itsafe for your little one, or how to ensure your closet of cleaning supplies won’t be a hazard for your baby. Think of all the chemicals that each one of those bottles, wipes, and sprays contains. Uh-oh! All of a sudden your home has turned into a science lab. So, to keep your baby away from becoming part of a science experiment, we created a guide on all things cleaning related when it comes to children in the home.\r\n\r\n#### **Children’s Health and Cleaning Supplies**\r\n\r\nMost cleaning supplies involve a lot of chemicals, many of which are a cause for concern, as they might cause health issues in early childhood. Some of the most common complications can include skin and eye irritation, asthma, hypersensitivity to allergens, chemical burns, and even poisoning.\r\n\r\nA good way to prevent your child from experiencing any of the health issues listed above is to have them avoid:\r\n\r\n- Coming into contact with recently cleaned household items\r\n- Breathing in chemicals emitted by cleaning products or recently cleaned objects\r\n- Accidentally ingesting or spilling cleaning products\r\n\r\nLuckily, you can also avoid specific chemicals in your cleaning supplies to minimize the danger they pose to your child’s health and safety. Keep in mind that these chemicals can compromise your child’s health, so watch out for these guys and the products they’re usually found in:\r\n\r\n- VOCs (paint, resin)\r\n- Bleach (clorox wipes)\r\n- Triclosan (some toothpastes, body washes, etc.)\r\n- Parabens (some shampoos, body washes, etc.)\r\n- Phthalates (detergents, food packaging, etc.)\r\n- Glycol ethers (paints and cleaners)\r\n- Petroleum solvents (paint)\r\n- Sodium lauryl sulfate (cleaning products and cosmetics)\r\n\r\n#### **Tips for Cleaning in a Child Safe Way**\r\n\r\nSimply having cleaning supplies at home that contains potential allergens will not automatically become a problem. However, if bottles of dish soap or bags of cleaning detergent aren’t stored correctly, they might cause trouble. Here are some tips to keep in mind when cleaning to ensure your sparkling clean home remains safe for your child:\r\n\r\n1. **Child-resistant caps:** Remember to buy products with **child-resistant caps**, so that your little one can’t experiment with that pretty blue liquid mama uses for laundry.\r\n2. Create a very clear separation between food and cleaning supplies:\r\n   1. Keep food and all cleaning supplies apart and far removed from each-other.\r\n   2. Do not store your cleaning supplies in old tupperware or any other food containers. Doing so may potentially lead to confusion.\r\n   3. Those curious toddler fingers, if left unattended even for a second, might reach for that bar of soap that looks like a maple leaf and smells like maple syrup and take a very unhealthy bite.\r\n3. **Don’t use poisons for rodents or insects:** Poison is very dangerous, whether it is for pests or your child. Even ant traps tucked around the corners of your home may become an issue. As your baby crawls around, everything in their reach becomes a point of exploration. Make sure that the area they are exploring is harm-free, and keep all harmful chemicals away from their reach.\r\n4. **Create a safety zone:** As your child gets older, you may want to teach them about household chores. Perhaps, they may take an interest in helping you clean up around the house. When this happens, create a cupboard with supplies that is okay for your child to use. Make sure it excludes anything with strong chemical components that may cause allergies or other severe reactions. Maybe having just a clean, colorful mop and a water sprayer in there is all that’s needed for now.\r\n5. **Keep your dishwasher closed:** Sharp items are very common objects in a dishwasher. Knifes, forks, fragile china cups are all the things you don’t want your child to get ahold of unattended while you’re cleaning up. Close the dishwasher to avoid having hand cymbals made of your favorite plates.\r\n6. **Dilute your cleaning products:** Many cleaners are so strong that can diluting them won’t really take anything away from all their cleaning glory. It will lessen the severity of chemical ingredients they include. Bonus point: your cleaning supplies will last you longer. However, make sure to check the product for dilution guidelines.\r\n7. **Ventilate:** After cleaning, always air out the rooms or the items that were cleaned. This will decrease the amount of chemicals that your child inhales and allow object to dry faster. Touching that counter top you just wiped down with Clorox wipes will become safer, too.\r\n\r\n#### **Child Safe Cleaning Supplies You Can Find in Your Cupboard**\r\n\r\nBefore we dive into the store-bought products that could be good counterparts to the more  chemical-heavy options, there are many items you likely already have in your cupboard that are great (and safe) for cleaning. Vinegar, lemon juice, and baking soda can all be mixed in different quantities and combinations to create kid-safe cleaning supplies. Mix some vinegar and water to dust off your shelves with or try using baking soda for oven cleaning. For a natural air-freshener mix two tablespoons of thyme and one sliced lime and spray the mixture around your home.  \r\n\r\n#### **Child Safe Cleaning Supplies Available on the Market**\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of all natural and low chemical cleaning supplies you can find at your local grocery store. These supplies are safer for your little ones and minimize the risks we mentioned above. Below are some suggestions for child safe cleaning supplies:\r\n\r\n- **Laundry Detergent:** Try using Molly’s Suds All Natural Laundry Powder or GreenShield Organic Laundry Detergent in place of the regular, more chemically saturated counterparts. Neither of these options contain harsh chemicals, which great for washing kids’ clothing.\r\n- **All-Purpose Cleaner:** With just six ingredients, Puracy Natural Multi-Surface Cleaner gets the job done, without endangering your child or you.\r\n- **Dish and Dishwasher Soaps:** Keep your food safe with Better Life Sulfate-Free Dish Soap and Seventh Generation Dishwasher Detergent Packs. Both are efficient in removing grease, while still being family-friendly. As a bonus, they are unscented.\r\n- **Hand Soap:** Keep your baby’s hands clean while avoiding skin irritations with Dr. Bronner’s Pure-Castille Liquid Soap – Baby, the unscented version.\r\n- **Dusters:** Wipe your shelves down with Aunt Fannie’s Cleaning Vinegar Wipes to avoid using chemical heavy solutions.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:31:26', '2021-03-10 20:06:49', '/resources/images/images_photo-1554344462-4d4ef7ecabc1-1024x683.jpeg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/baby-proof-cleaning', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (71, 9, 'What to Do if You Find Mold in Your Apartment', '', '![img](/resources/images/images_Screen-Shot-2019-03-22-at-5.14.46-PM.png)\r\n\r\nYou love your apartment, but suddenly you come across something unexpected. No, it’s not a good surprise. It’s mold. Stinky, hazardous mold. So what do you if you’ve found mold in your apartment? Don’t worry, we got you. Follow these tips on how to deal with mold.\r\n\r\n### What to do if you find mold in your apartment?\r\n\r\n#### 1. Tell your landlord\r\n\r\nIf you have suspicions that there is mold in your apartment, or if you’ve found and it’s blatantly obvious, don’t wait to tell you landlord. It is in their best interest, as well as yours to get rid of it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Take photos\r\n\r\nTake photos of the mold prior to removing the mold. In case your landlord is slow to take care of it or does not take action at all, (more about that later) you will need proof of the mold situation.\r\n\r\n#### 3. See a doctor\r\n\r\nYou might think you’re having allergies. If you’re constantly sneezing, coughing, experiencing headaches, or even nosebleeds, mold could actually be the culprit. Don’t hesitate to make an appointment with your doctor and get checked out.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Run tests\r\n\r\nTo ensure that the mold is properly removed, first you need to determine what type of mold made it in to your home - yes, there are variations. You or your landlord, depending on your agreement, should schedule an indoor air quality check test. Once the type of mold is determined, then steps for removing it can take place.\r\n\r\n### What if the landlord is failing to take action?\r\n\r\n#### 1. Ask a lawyer\r\n\r\nYour state might not require for you to have a lawyer, but it may be helpful to get a professional’s opinion on your best options and how to proceed in case your landlord does not take action to remove the mold. Remember, mold is harmful to your health and you want it to be gone as soon as possible. You might have to file a lawsuit and the court will be able to order a repair.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Keep documentation\r\n\r\nRemember to keep copies of your written interaction with the landlord, the photos of mold, and any receipts revolving around the issue. For example, keep the results from the indoor air quality test check.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Move out\r\n\r\nIf the issue is not being resolved, it is probably best to move out, especially if the landlord is not responsive. It is probably a good sign that the accommodations aren’t safe for you.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:32:12', '2021-03-10 20:07:22', '/resources/images/images_Screen-Shot-2019-03-22-at-5.14.46-PM.jpeg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/baby-proof-cleaning', 0, 0);

INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (73, 9, 'Tidying up with Marie Kondo: 6 Tips to Implement in 2019', '', '![img](/resources/images/images_IMG_1359.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt’s January - the time of new beginnings, New Year’s resolutions and crowded gyms. If you haven’t figured out how to improve your life in 2019, worry not...we have anarticle just for you! Long story short, this is the year when you finally tidy up your apartment and declutter your life!\r\n\r\nIf you’ve done any research on decluttering, there is a chance you’ve come across the KonMari method. It was first featured in the No. 1 New York Times best-selling book “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.” Now the same methods are being showcased in Netflix\'s new show, \"Tidying Up with Marie Kondo.\" The method suggests to only keep things that “spark joy” to make your life happier and your home neater. To give you a gist of Kondo’s method, we put together 5 helpful tips that you can start implementing today.\r\n\r\n### 1. Follow the right order when tidying up your place.\r\n\r\n“Winging it” can be fun and exciting on certain occasions, but not when it comes to cleaning your home. Having a plan is necessary to achieve a neat home where everything has its place. According to Kondo, there is an optimal order to follow when organizing your belongings:\r\n\r\n1. Clothes\r\n2. Books\r\n3. Papers\r\n4. Komono - other household items; miscellaneous random items cluttering up your flat surfaces and drawers.\r\n5. Sentimental items - trophies, postcards, letters and those bridesmaid dresses you’ll never wear again.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, sentimental items are saved for last since they are much harder to part with. For convenience, try creating subcategories within those listed above. This will make organizing and “purging” way easier.\r\n\r\n### 2. Organize by category, not by room.\r\n\r\nMost people tend to clean room by room, moving from one location to another. While it might seem convenient, it can be counterproductive. Stationary is a good example of things that tend to get spread out around the house - a pen here, a pencil there. If you organize room by room, as opposed to categories, you won’t see the full picture of your inventory - what you have in abundance and what you actually need. Need help categorizing your household items? Check out our ultra-detailed printableKonMari checklist!\r\n\r\n### 3. Stop stacking.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the main principles of the KonMari method. According to Marie, putting things in piles is detrimental in many ways. For instance, people tend to forget about items that end up on the bottom of a pile. Plus, when stacking things on top of one another, it’s easy to go on forever without noticing how much stuff you’ve accumulated. It seems pretty obvious that it’s easier to find a book on a shelf than in a pile, but we often forget that the same principle can be applied to other belongings like clothes or stationery.\r\n\r\n### 4. Arrange your clothes vertically and by color.\r\n\r\nThink about your closet and that pile of shirts somewhere on a shelf or in your bottom drawer. It’s easy to forget about clothes on the bottom of the stack, especially if the top items are bulkier. Even if you remember them, they are probably wrinkled up under the weight of the clothes on top. To tackle this issue, Marie Kondo recommends dividing clothes by categories, folding them and storing vertically when possible for better visibility. Keep clothes of the same color together arranging them from darkest to lightest, left to right respectively, creating a gradient. Only hang clothes that have to be hanged - the ones made out of soft breezy fabrics, tailored cuts and easily-wrinkled clothing that should not be folded. When hanging these items try to arrange them in a way so they rise towards the right. Longer, heavier items should stay on the left side, shorter and lighter items on the right side creating a sort of a triangle. There are numerous benefits to doing so.You\'ll get a better understanding of your wardrobe, what you have, what you need, and what you can get rid of. Marie has a series ofvideos on how to properly fold different items to keep them fresh, wrinkle-free, and vertically storable.\r\n\r\n### 5. Keep all paper in one spot.\r\n\r\nThe basic principle regarding paper outlined in Marie Kondo’s book is to throw it all away. Well, almost all of it. She recommends only keeping documents that fall into one of three categories: currently used, needed for a limited period of time, and documents that have to be kept forever, e.g. your birth certificate and social security number. The rest have to go. She also points out that all documents that you have to deal with should be stored in one place and not scattered around your house. Papers that have to be kept indefinitely can all go in one file, you can store the rest in separate files in a plastic folder for easier access. And no more stacks!\r\n\r\n### 6. Store bags in another bag.\r\n\r\nTotes, handbags, clutches, backpacks - those things take up a lot of a precious space. After years of experimenting, Marie Kondo came up with a simple but genius method of storing bags. It will drastically reduce space required for their storage and make it easier to find a purse you’d like to wear today. Just nest bags of the same type into one another! That way all your clutches will be in one place and easy to find. Make sure to keep all the straps and handles outside in plain view. This method not only saves your space, but also teaches you a great habit of emptying your purse whenever you don’t use it.\r\n\r\nHome organization is a science and organizing consultants are there for a reason. However, we strongly believe that if you take time and put some effort into implementing the above-mentioned principles, your home will become a neater place in no time. And according to Marie Kondo, a clean and organized home is the key to a happier life!', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-10 20:08:55', '/resources/images/images_IMG_1359.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/tidying-up-with-marie-kondo-6-tips-to-implement-in-2019', 0, 0);

INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (75, 7, 'Deciding If It\'s Safe to Go Out', '', '![Woman in mask](/resources/images/safe-to-go-out.jpg)\n\nMany Maryland businesses that were forced to close due to coronavirus are now open. That has a lot of people wondering: Is it safe to go out?\n\nThough some businesses are open and restrictions around some activities have been lifted, it is still important to consider your specific health situation when making this important decision.\n\nThere are many activities that people were not allowed to do in Maryland during the beginning of the pandemic. Now, many of these businesses and activities are open. Some activities that you have a choice to take part in include:\n\n-Going out to eat at a restaurant or bar\n-Getting a haircut\n- Getting your nails done\n- Going to the movies\n- Going to shopping malls\n-Outdoor activities like visiting public parks or fishing\n\nRight now, the question shouldn\'t be \"Is it safe to go out?\" Instead, you should be asking yourself if it\'s safe for *you *to do a specific activity or visit a certain place.\n\n## Going Out During the Coronavirus Pandemic\n\nDeciding if it\'s safe to go out can be difficult at this time. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), here are the high-level questions you should be asking yourself before going out:\n\n- Is coronavirus spreading in your community?\n- Will you potentially have close contact with someone who is sick?\n- Will you potentially have close contact with people who are not wearing a face mask?\n- Do you have or live with someone who has anunderlying condition that could increase the risk of severe illness?\n- Do you take everyday coronavirus prevention measures?\n\nEven if you answer all of these questions and determine that you might be able to go out, there are other factors that you should take into consideration.\n\n### The Number of People\n\nThe more people you interact with, the higher your risk of contracting the virus will be.Social distancing is currently one of the best tools we have for preventing this virus.\n\nPeople who feel sick or areconcerned they may have the virus should stay home to avoid infecting others, but even if someone doesn\'t appear sick or show anycoronavirus symptoms, they could be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease and infect others.\n\n### Ability to Physically Distance\n\nIf you are going out, you should ideally be able to remain at least six feet away from people who do not live with you. The closer you are to other people, the higher your risk of contracting the virus.\n\nWearing a mask can help reduce the chance of coronavirus spread when you can\'t maintain the recommended six feet of distancing.\n\n### Length of Time\n\nIf the activity you are participating in or the place you are going requires prolonged time in close contact with others, then the risk of contracting the virus will be higher.\n\nIf you are an asymptomatic carrier of the virus, prolonged contact with others could also put them at risk for contracting the virus. Wearing a mask can help reduce this risk, but the longer you are in close contact with others, the higher the chance that you or someone else will take off their mask or have it slip off of their face.\n\n## Coronavirus Tips: Going Out Safely\n\nIf you take all of these factors into account and decide that it\'s safe to go out, you still need to take some basic prevention measures to help keep yourself safe.\n\n### Practice Basic Prevention Measures\n\nWhen you are out, continue practicing the prevention measures that we know keep us safe from coronavirus. This includes:\n\n- Staying at least six feet apart from others\n- Wearing a mask\n-Washing your hands often\n-Avoiding touching your face\n- Practicing proper coughing etiquette\n- Monitoring your health before leaving the house\n\n### Have a Kit\n\nIf you decide to go out, it\'s important to have some essentials on hand for preventing coronavirus infection and properlydisinfecting yourself and high-touch objects. This should include:\n\n- A face mask\n- Hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol\n- Tissues, which can be used to cover your mouth if you sneeze or cough and when you must come in contact with high-touch surfaces like doorknobs\n\n### Stay Outside\n\nMany indoor places are currently open to the public in a limited capacity. However, the CDC currently recommends being outside when possible, especially if you are going to be in close proximity to other people.\n\nOutdoor locations usually provide ample room to remain six or more feet apart from others. If you must be indoors, look for a location with some additional air ventilation, such as an open window.\n\n### Look for Barriers\n\nBarriers between people — such as plexiglass screens, floor markings and modified layouts — can help limit the spread of coronavirus. This not only keeps the droplets that help spread coronavirus from reaching others, but it also provides a visual reminder for people to keep their distance.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-10 23:44:51', '/resources/images/safe-to-go-out.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/daily-life-coping/safe-to-go-out', 1, 0);

You may find yourself afraid to go, even when it\'s necessary.\n\nNow more than ever, it is important to keep yourself healthy. Keeping yourself healthy means addressing health problems as they arise.\n\nThis includes getting evaluated by your primary care physician and going to an emergency room (ER) when appropriate.\n\n## Should I Go to the Hospital?\n\nStaying at home when possible is an important part of containing coronavirus spread. However, people experiencing medical emergencies or those that need urgent medical care should not stay at home. If you need care, you should go to the hospital.\n\nNow more than ever, ERs are here for communities in Maryland and the nation. Hospitals across the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) will never close our doors to anyone who needs care.\n\nPlease do not ignore your body. Warning signs and symptoms should be discussed with your doctor or evaluated at an urgent care or ER, depending on the severity of symptoms.\n\n## When to Go to the ER\n\nGo to the hospital if you experience symptoms of *any *life-threatening illnesses, not just forsymptoms of coronavirus.\n\n### Symptoms of a Medical Emergency\n\nSymptoms that may indicate a life-threatening emergency include:\n\n- Difficulty breathing, shortness of breath\n- Chest or upper abdominal pain or pressure\n- Fainting, sudden dizziness or weakness\n- Changes in vision\n- Confusion or changes in mental status\n- Any sudden or severe pain\n- Uncontrolled bleeding\n- Severe or persistent vomiting or diarrhea\n- Coughing or vomiting blood\n- Difficulty speaking\n\nGetting urgent help when needed is especially important for strokes and heart attacks. Outcomes for these medical emergencies are tied to how quickly the patient receives care, so delaying getting treatment due to coronavirus fears can have serious consequences.\n\nPeople withexisting medical conditions that increase the likelihood of experiencing a medical emergency should speak with their doctor about managing their condition during the pandemic.\n\n## When to Go to the Doctor\n\nBeyond emergency care, health problems that are treated earlier do much better than health problems that are treated later. Sometimes irreversible damage can occur when you delay care. For example, wounds that are not appropriately cared for become infected or need more extensive procedures than they would have otherwise.\n\nWhile it\'s important to continuesocial distancing as much as possible, you can still go to the doctor\'s office for some regularly scheduled wellness exams. For example, it is important to attend exams where a child will be getting routine vaccinations to protect them against other viruses and bacteria in the community.\n\nDepending on the situation, your primary care doctor may provide you an in-person visit or a telehealth evaluation. Contact your doctor to find out what type of visit might be appropriate. You can useMyPortfolio to communicate with your UMMS provider.\n\n### Telemedicine Visits\n\nA telehealth evaluation can address some non-urgent health concerns, including routine appointments, wound evaluations and medication refills or adjustments.\n\nMany UMMS physicians have the ability to evaluate you via telemedicine, which means you don\'t need to leave your home for a doctor evaluation.\n\nIf you have a health question, scheduling a telemedicine appointment can be an option for non-emergency situations. Call your physician to learn more about the best options for your specific health needs.\n\n## Going to the Hospital for Coronavirus\n\nMost people who have coronavirus experience mildsymptoms that can be treated at home. However, some people, particularly those who haveunderlying conditions, may experience more serious symptoms that require treatment at a hospital.\n\nSerious coronavirus symptoms that could require emergency care include:\n\n- Trouble breathing\n- Persistent pain or pressure in the chest\n- New confusion or can\'t be woken up\n- Lips or face turning blue\n\nIf you have questions about your symptoms, call your doctor or talk to a registered nurse through theUMMS Nurse Call Line.\n\nIf your symptoms are life-threatening, call 911 or go to the ER right away.\n\n## Hospital Safety During Coronavirus\n\nHospitals across the nation are facing challenges due to the pandemic. Despite this, hospitals are still safe places to come to for care.\n\nThere are a number of measures that University of Maryland Medical System hospitals are taking to keep you safe.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nYou may not have had reason to wonder how to remove gel nail polish before, but if you’re currently avoiding your salon and going theDIY nail route instead, it’s important to learn how to do it properly. Spoiler alert: Just ripping off your gel manicure is not a good idea. Everything might appear to be okay to the naked eye, but you actually strip the delicate layers of the nail plate (the hard part of the nail that grows out) when youtear your gel nails off this way, and it can potentially cause permanent damage.\n\nTo avoid screwing up your nails, we asked celebrity manicuristPatricia Yankee how to remove gel nail polish at home. Her professional advice to ensure the health of your nails is to head back to your salon for proper removal when it’s safe to do so. But if you can’t or don’t want to make the trip right now, there are a few easy-to-follow steps to get similar results at home.\n\n## Step 1: Protect your cuticles.\n\nAcetone—which you’ll need to remove your gels—can wreak havoc on the skin around your nails, so you need to protect your poorcuticles. “Before you soak, protect the surrounding areas with a cuticle oil,” Yankee explains. There’s no need to get a fancy specialty cuticle oil unless you want to. A tried-and-true quick home remedy is Vaseline ($3,Amazon). The petroleum jelly will create a barrier to minimize the acetone’s damage. Aquaphor ($10,Amazon) works too.\n\n## Step 2: Loosen up the top layer with a coarse nail file.\n\nThe gel topcoat is a tough nearly impermeable layer that seals the color in place—that’s why gelmanicures are able to last for weeks instead of days. Scratching the surface with a coarse nail file will help the acetone to penetrate without a hitch. “When filing, apply a light and parallel pressure,” Yankee says, which will help you avoid scratching the nail plate underneath.\n\n## Step 3: Soak your nails in acetone using cotton balls and aluminum foil.\n\nAcetone ($5,Ulta) is stronger and more effective than non-acetone nail polish remover, making it exactly what you need to remove your gel nail polish. Drench some cotton balls with the stuff, then hold them in place on your nails by wrapping each finger with aluminum foil. According to Yankee, this traps in heat to help the gel break down faster. Gel polish formulas vary in strength, so the wait time can be anywhere between 10 and 20 minutes. If you don’t get it exactly right, you can always rewrap and keep on soaking.\n\nYankee\'s expert tip: “Sometimes it’s best to do one hand at a time at home. I like to start with the dominant hand to get the toughest part out of the way.” So if you’re a lefty, begin soaking the nails on your left hand, and then your right hand will be a breeze. “It’s a small change, but it makes a huge difference,” she says.\n\n## Step 4: Gently scrape away the layers and soak again if needed.\n\nOnce you give the acetone time to work its magic, grab the file (or a wooden orange stick) and continue to gently scrape the layers to safely remove the gel polish from yournail. If you’ve soaked long enough, the first few coats will begin to peel off easily.\n\nIf you encounter more resistant layers, you’ll need to loosen them up with another acetone soak. Repeat the soaking-and-scraping method until you’ve safely removed all of the color, including the base coat.\n\n## Step 5: Wash up and moisturize.\n\n“After you finish soaking in acetone, you want to make sure that you wash thoroughly,” Yankee says. She also suggests putting on another coat of cuticle oil. If you want to get a little fancier thanpetroleum jelly this time, try the highly rated favorite Maccibelle Cuticle Oil ($7,Amazon), which comes in three different scents: milk and honey, pomegranate, and tea tree–lavender.\n\nYankee also suggests keeping the habit up for a few days “just to replenish the moisture in your nails,” since acetone can be so harsh.\n\n## Bonus: A few products to make your life easier next time.\n\nThe process of removing gel nail polish isn’t exactly the hardest thing in the world, but hey, sometimes you want to streamline the whole ordeal even more. There are sets with everything you need to take off your gels, as well as handy products to troubleshoot some of the more annoying parts of the process.

When I looked down at my finger, I saw lots of blood and a huge crack across my entirenail. For the next 30 minutes, my friends and I raced around the mall looking for a Band-Aid and some Advil (Note: I’ve kept afirst aid kit in my car ever since).\n\nAfter the bleeding finally stopped, I was left with a cracked and bruised fingernail. My first inclination was to cover up the ugly wound with agel manicure. (Yes, that’s my vanity showing.) But it turns out, that is the worst thing to do.\n\nWhat that experience taught me is that I have a *lot* of questions about what to do when I\'ve injured a fingernail. I know I’m not the first person to slam a finger in a car door or jam it in a window, so I took my questions to the professionals to get all the answers, from basic first aid to the right way to cover up a bruised fingernail or other nail mishap. Here’s what you need to know.\n\n## What causes nail bruising?\n\nLike the bruises you get on any part of your body, nail bruising happens when blunt force crushes the small blood vessels under your skin, perU.S. National Library of Medicine. Most fingernail injuries affect the nail plate (the hard part of the nail that grows out), which can crack and potentially fall off, and the nail bed (the skin underneath the nail plate), which can bleed and bruise. So when we’re discussing a nail bruise, we’re really talking about a nail *plate* bruise.\n\nThat said, what you might assume is a nail bruise because of the purple or black color might actually be blood, since the same kind of trauma that causes bruising can cause bleeding too. The official name for this is a subungual hematoma, according to theAmerican Osteopathic College of Dermatology. That pretty much just means a blood blister under the nail.\n\n## What should I do if I bruise my fingernail?\n\nWhen the injury first happens, you can take care of any immediate first aid needs. Basic wound care applies here: Put pressure on the area to slow the bleeding if there is any, clean the wound with soap and water, apply a bandage, and take an analgesic tohelp with pain if needed. You can also ice your finger if you’ve got swelling in the area, dermatologist Ted Lain, M.D., tells SELF.\n\nAs you do all this, you should also assess the extent of the damage and whether or not a trip to the doctor is necessary. Speaking of...\n\n## When should I see a doctor?\n\nThere are a few things to look out for when it comes to deciding if you should see a doctor right after you injure your fingernail. Some signs include: \n\n- **Lack of blood flow**: Press on a portion of the nail or finger that is not injured. If the area turns white and then turns pink within seconds when you release the pressure, you’ve got good capillary refill. That means blood is still flowing. If not, it’s a good idea to get it checked out.\n- **Loss of sensation:** You should also touch the tip of your finger to make sure you still have feeling in the area. “As long as you can feel everything, you probably don’t have anynerve damage,” says Dr. Lain.\n- **Unusual colors in your fingertip:** You also want to make sure the skin at the tip of the finger isn’t blue or blanched white—unusual colors are a sign you need to see a doctor.\n- **A lot of blood under your nail bed:** Because large subungual hematomas increase the risk of your fingernail falling off, doctors will often drain accumulated blood by drilling a small hole in the nail plate. In Dr. Lain’s clinical experience, blood that encompasses more than 50 percent of your nail is a good sign you should hit up a doctor, but there are no official recommendations. You can play it safe and have a smaller subungual hematoma drained too. The key is to get it done within 24 hours, before the blood coagulates.\n- **Injury to your nail matrix:** This is the tissue at the base of your nail where nail growth happens. Since damage to the nail matrix could cause your nail to grow out strangely for the rest of your life, you should let a professional evaluate how serious it is just in case. “If the pressure can be released, then we can feasibly help to control any damage that might happen to the nail matrix,” says Dr. Lain.\n\nIf you’re clear of the above signs, you’re likely good to skip the doctor and let the bruise heal up on its own. As for a cracked nail, you’ll have to wait for the damage to grow out. (Fun fact: Fingernails grow an average of 3.47 millimeters a month according to one 2010 study published in the*Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology*.)\n\nAll that said, in the days following the injury, you should also be on the lookout for signs of infection.\n\n## What are the signs of a fingernail infection?\n\n“If there is any pus, if it becomes really red and hot after the fact, or there is a lot of swelling, it’s a sign ofinfection,” dermatologist Mona Gohara, M.D., tells SELF. “If it’s green, that’s another sign that there is bacteria in there.” There might also be persistent pain that just doesn\'t wane. These symptoms are all signs you need to see a doctor. Make an appointment with a dermatologist, primary care physician, or at an urgent care center to get the wound drained and get a prescription for antibiotics.\n\nIf you see red streaks on your hand or forearm or you feelfeverish or nauseated, it could be much more serious. These are signs that the infection has spread to the bloodstream, which can lead to sepsis. \"Sepsis is extremely serious, and anyone seeing the infection worsening with the spread to the hand should seek care at an E.R.,\" says Dr. Lain.\n\n## What should I do if my fingernail starts falling off (or falls off completely)?\n\nYes, your fingernail falling off is a thing that can happen, so it’s good to be prepared. After an acute trauma, your nail may turn black and seem like it\'s barely hanging on. Please, please, don’t pull it off. You can cut it down, but let the injury grow out on its own. “Leave it alone, because there is new nail growing underneath,” says Dr. Lain. “The new nail will push up the old nail, and it will come off when it’s ready.”\n\nOnce the fingernail falls off, it’s a good idea to protect the sensitive skin of the nail bed with a Band-Aid. “If you leave it open to the air, it can get very dry and very cracked, and if it gets traumatized, it can affect how the nail grows,” says Dr. Lain.\n\nIn some cases, like if the nail bed is infected, the doctor might have to remove the nail by force. This procedure is called a nail evulsion: First, they numb up your finger with a local numbing treatment. Then the doctor uses special tools to lift the nail on each side and peel the plate away from the nail bed. (Kind of sounds like something out of ahorror movie, right?)\n\n## Can I get a manicure with a bruised fingernail?\n\nNow, here’s what I really wanted to know: Can I cover a cracked or bruised fingernail with pretty polish while it’s healing? The answer is yes—with a few precautions.\n\nDr. Lain recommends first coating the nail with a layer of nail hardener to help protect the nail plate, and Dr. Gohara says nail polish is totally fine if there is just a crack in the nail (once the bleeding has stopped and the injury has had some time to heal, of course).\n\nThat said, you should put a pause on your gel manicure habit. \"It is not the application of the gel, or the product itself, but rather the removal process that concerns me,\" says Dr. Lain. \"Gel polish is commonly removed incorrectly, leading to a compromise of the nail\'s integrity or worsening of underlying damage.\"\n\nAbove all, both derms say to avoid the nail salon. “If somebody is using scissors and cutting, you can introduce bacteria or fungus, because the nail has already been compromised,” says Dr. Gohara. It’s best to stick toDIY manicures until the nail has grown out. Luckily, we’re avoiding nail salons right now anyway, right?', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '/resources/images/bruised_nail_hand.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/bruised-fingernail', 1, 0);

Before this year, many of us thought we were handling our hands and fingers like pros, but, let\'s face it, many of us had less than ideal habits. Maybe you skimped on the 20-second handwashing rule, or maybe you had clean hands but used them totouch your face and rub your eyes constantly. And there are those who, try as we might, can\'t figure out how to stop biting our nails.\n\nIf you’re (like me) among the nail-biting people of the world, then you’ve probably discovered the following: Nail biting doesn’t stop just because we want it to. My guess? Even though the stakes are high given thenew coronavirus pandemic, many of us are probably having a tough time avoiding nibbling away at our nubby nails from time to time. You’re not alone. Way before the new coronavirus was disrupting our lives, writer Emily Rekstis tried a few common hacks to see if she could break herself of the habit. You’ll find those tips below. But before we get into that, let’s run through a few basics, shall we?\n\n## Why do people bite their nails?\n\nYou might not know this, but nail biting falls under a list of behaviors known asbody-focused repetitive disorders (or BFRDs), which are those little habits we have (think hair pulling or skin picking) that, when done often enough, can cause harm. AsSELF previously reported, it’s not entirely clear why some people have BFRDs, but there are known triggers. SELF previously reported that those triggers fall into five main categories: There are sensory triggers, which might be anything that evokes the senses (taste, touch, sight, smell, or hearing). You may be triggered by certain thoughts or beliefs (these are called cognitive triggers). You could bite your nails when you face something called a motor trigger, which involves postures and movements that you make (and might not even be aware of). Even certain places might make your nail nibbling more prevalent (these are called setting triggers).\n\n## Is nail biting actually that bad?\n\nHere’s the thing: Some viruses live on surfaces and when we touch those spots (like doorknobs or subway rails) and then touch our eyes, nose, or mouths, we run the risk of helping those germs get into our bodies,Philip Tierno, Ph.D., microbiologist and clinical professor of pathology at NYU Langone,previously told SELF. It’s not a given that biting your nails will make you sick more frequently than those who don’t, but putting your fingers in your mouth isn’t doing your immune system any favors.\n\nBut even if you’re not thinking about germs, biting your fingernails can also cause damage to your nail bed, theMayo Clinic explains. This can leave tiny cuts that put you at greater risk for bacteria and fungus to hang out and cause infections, theMayo Clinic says. Biting your fingernails can also potentially damage your teeth, according to theMayo Clinic. All of that means it’s best to keep your fingernails out of your mouth. So, how to do that you may wonder?\n\n## There are things you can do to help you stop biting your nails.\n\nIt might be possible for some people to go cold turkey, but many people will need some strategies to guide them. The tips from theAmerican Academy of Dermatology Association (AADA) are a great place to start. They offer a mix of practical strategies as well as mental exercises that can help you. For example, among the strategies recommended by the AADA are identifying your nail-biting triggers, keeping your nails clipped short, and taking a gradual approach (as in, just work on stopping biting one fingernail at a time). The AADA also explains that nail biting might be a sign of emotional or psychological distress. So if you’ve tried to stop biting your nails and can’t, there’s no harm in contacting your doctor to discuss your concerns. And if you develop an infection from nail biting, a dermatologist or other healthcare provider can help you treat it, theAADA says.\n\n## Here’s what happened when Emily Rekstis tried to break her nail-biting habit. Here’s what she said:\n\nBiting your nails is a terrible habit, one that I can’t seem to knock. I turned to the internet and talked to experts to find the best hacks that will hopefully help me break my habit. Here\'s how my little experiment went:\n\n1. I dipped my nails in salt.\n\n![Image may contain Human Person and Nail](/resources/images/IMG_5229.JPG)\n\n\n\nI’ve used anti-biting polish like Maval Stop Polish ($31,Walmart) in the past, so I didn’t want to try that this time around. Instead, I went for aDIY solution that served the same purpose. This hack I found while scrolling through the many threads on Reddit about nail biting: First, you dip your nails in water. Then you dip them in salt and dust off some of the excess (funnily, this is the same process I use when putting salt on the rim of a margarita glass).\n\nLike the anti-biting polish, the salt is meant to leave a gross taste in your mouth when you bite your nails. “This unappealing taste is worth a try if you are looking for a DIY solution,” dermatologistMelanie D. Palm, M.D., explains. “But some may not find this is enough of a deterrent, and the salt granules may cause a mess.” She also points out that if you rub your eye with salt-covered fingers, it can really sting and hurt. Keeping that in mind, I decided to give it a try.\n\n**Did it work?**\n\nSimply put—no, it did not work and for many different reasons. First, it was hard to keep the salt on the nails. It was fine if I was justwatching TV or reading. But when I did it before I started working on my computer, thesalt would fall off and make a mess on my keyboard. I also did it before going out one night, so I rubbed some (actually, most) of it off before hopping on the subway. It just felt kind of sloppy and weird to have my fingers covered in salt. After removing some there was still the faintest hint of salt left behind. However, this didn’t really bother me.\n\nWhich brings me to another reason it didn’t really work. I love salt! I don’t love huge amounts of it like my fingers would pick up when they first were dipped in it. But the faint traces the salt would leave behind after most of it fell off did not keep me from putting my finger in my mouth. The only thing I will say is that the taste of salt would remind me that my nails were in my mouth when they weren’t supposed to be—not a great deterrent, but a good wakeup call.\n\n2. I rubbed jalapeños on each nail.\n\n![Image may contain Human Person Finger Nail and Hand](/resources/images/IMG_5213.JPG)\n\nThis was another Reddit hack I found in the same thread as the salt tip, and the premise is the same: putting a bad flavor on your nails to keep you from continuing to bite them. I bought a jar of jalapeño slices and rubbed the juice all over my cuticles and nail beds. Palm notes, “This is relatively safe, but one should make sure they aren’t allergic to the pepper or accidentally rub their face and eyes, as this could cause a severe reaction.” I do not have an allergy to peppers, so I went for it. I was very—VERY—careful not to rub my eyes afterward.\n\n**Did it work?**\n\nThis worked a little better than the salt did since the taste was more shocking when my tongue hit it. My hand would pull out of my mouth immediately. The shock of a spicy jalapeño is not something you’re used to tasting without other food. However, thespiciness only lasted an hour or so, and unlike the salt, there really wasn’t even the slightest hint of residue. So when I was out of the house for long periods of time, it would wear off, and I\'d end up biting away again.\n\nBut the real reason I can\'t recommend this one, is the sheer ickiness factor. If I thought the salt felt dirty, this felt even dirtier. My fingers felt sticky and stinky after I’d rubbed a pepper all over them. Even if I just kept it to the nail, the juices would drip all over my fingers. It felt like I needed to wash my hands after, because, honestly, I did! But then that would defeat the purpose of using the jalapeño.\n\n3. I carried cuticle scissors around.\n\n![This image may contain Human Person Manicure Nail Jewelry Accessories Accessory Ring and Finger](/resources/images/IMG_5243.JPG)\n\nWhen I say I bite my nails, I mean I bite my nails and tear off the cuticles surrounding them. Unfortunately, this means my cuticles are sore and often bleeding. Carrying a cuticle cutter around, like the Revlon Full Jaw Cuticle Nipper ($14,Walmart), was supposed to give me a way to deal with my ragged cuticles so I wouldn\'t pick at them with my teeth. “Some people are able to avoid manipulating the cuticles by trimming them when they have the urge to pick them,” explains RealSelf contributor,Sejal Shah, M.D. I was hoping that I was one of those “some people” she was talking about.\n\n**Did it work?**\n\nYes and no. Yes, because having the scissors at hand (pun intended) kept me from using my mouth to clean up hangnails or cuticles. With that being said, having them around almost brought more attention to the work my nails and cuticles needed. I found myself becoming obsessive about keeping my cuticles clean and precise. I’d whip out the scissors at any moment—and place—if I noticed an issue. I’m not very good with the scissors, so I almost always messed up mycuticles and nails even more, and then would spend more time fixing them.\n\nThe scissors did keep my hands out of my mouth. But it did not help with my quest for stronger, longer, healthier nails and cuticles. In fact, my cuticles looked even worse after this hack.\n\n4. I snapped a rubber band on my wrist.\n\n![Image may contain Human Person Finger Female Woman Blonde Teen Girl Kid and Child](/resources/images/IMG_5209.JPG)\n\nThe idea here was to substitute a different nervous habit for the one I was trying to break. Unlike the salt and jalapeño, this hack occupied my hands with something other than biting my nails. “It\'s basically an alternative behavior,” explains Shah. “Nail biting or picking cuticles are often nervous habits or a way to relieve stress, so by engaging in analternative behavior when you feel the urge, especially one that keeps your hands busy, you may be able to avoid biting your nails.”\n\n**Did it work?**\n\nNot really. There isn’t too much to say about this one because it simply did not work. I think that maybe if I were to continue doing it that I would subconsciously begin to reach for the rubber band instead of putting my nails between my teeth. However, my immediate reaction was to put my nails in my mouth, not go to my wrist. When I found myself going to my mouth with my fingers, I would move to the rubber band, but other times it was too late, and I already was biting my nails.\n\n5. I just thought about all the bacteria on my fingers.\n\n![Image may contain Human Person Manicure Nail Jewelry Ring Accessories and Accessory](/resources/images/IMG_5198.JPG)\n\nOne of the motivations for getting back on the no-biting wagon was that in the past two months, I’ve gotten tonsillitis twice, and I’m convinced it’s because of the germs I’m putting in my mouth when biting my nails. I asked two doctors about it, and while they both said I\'m definitely ingesting some grossness—I live in NYC for goodness sake!—it\'s unlikely that\'s what\'s causing my illnesses.\n\nMy fear (however unfounded) ended up working in my favor, though, when I tried a mindset practice that kept coming up in my research. Each time I found myself putting my hands in my mouth, I thought about where my hands had been that day, all the germs that might be on them, and how much I wanted not to get sick. PsychologistEmma Seppälä tells SELF that using my worry about ingesting bacteria to fight the urge to bite makes a lot of sense. “Ways to break bad habits are strengthening your willpower through exercises likemindfulness and meditation,\" she says. Tapping into my emotional response could help me resist the pull of my ingrained behavior.\n\nEven though I know that nail biting and tonsillitis aren’t directly associated, I could use my distinct memories of the sore throat and fevers as an easy tool to use to break my habit.\n\n**Did it work?**\n\nSurprisingly, this trick seemed to work best. Since I really don’t want to bite my nails, I stopped when I noticed what I was doing. It’s hard to say if this would always work, though. Since I was working on a story about biting my nails, I was often thinking about it and making notes for this piece. However, in day-to-day circumstances, I bite my nails without even realizing I’m doing it a lot of times. That’s where the other hacks like salt and jalapeño come in. They may not have turned me away from doing it, but they did make me aware that my hands were in my mouth—which made them beneficial in their own sort of way.\n\n## The lesson: When it comes to nail biting, mindfulness helps.\n\nThese hacks didn’t help much more than my mom applying anti-biting polish when I was younger. Will I be rubbing salt or jalapeños on my nails again? No, definitely not. I might keep carrying a cuticle scissor around with me, though, so that if I find myself obsessing over some rough skin, I can take care of it without turning to myteeth. The best thing to come out of my testing was realizing that my nail biting is clearly a subconscious behavior I do when I’manxious and bored, so the best thing for me to do is notice and stop. Being mindful of the fact that I\'m biting my nails—and when and where and how often I do it—is step one in getting myself not to bite my nails. So that\'s what I\'m going to focus on. And when I do, thinking about all the gross germs on my fingers is motivation enough to keep them out of my mouth. At least for the moment.\n\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-11 13:23:38', '/resources/images/nail_biting.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/nail-biting-hacks', 1, 0);

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\n\nI wanted to hate Olive & June’s Everything Manicure Box. The skeptical side of me thought, There’s no way this is a good deal. *$80?* To do my own nails? Please. Still, I yearned for a manicure—to feel a surge of joy and normalcy upon glimpsing my pretty, painted hands, even if I’m not headed to any formal events or an office soon. So when I received a sample, I decided to try it with an open mind, and somewhat begrudgingly, I really, really like this dang box. It makes doing my own nails way more enjoyable than it’s ever been before.\n\nFor a little background: I have a long-running relationship with nails/manicures. I sucked my thumb until the age of five, when my dentist persuaded me out of it (with the promise of an enormous stuffed reindeer, which I named, no lie, Rudolph Giuliani). But then I took up nail biting instead. In my adolescent years, I tried to quit by using bitter-tasting polishes designed to turn me off, but this didn’t work. I continued chewing my nails, hated myself for doing so, and, in turn, spiraled and bit them more.\n\nIn my 20s, after I moved to New York and landed my first job, I finally stopped nail biting by getting regular gel manicures. On one hand, yay, I no longer bit my nails! On the other hand, I became reliant on salons, spending $40 every two weeks to swap out shades. This was incredibly costly, an exhausting use of time, and—as I stuck my hands under a U.V. light to dry the gel—potentially damaging for my skin. I realized that I couldn’t, nor did I *want* to, spend the rest of my life replacing one habit with another. I eventually gave up manicures completely and just let my natural nails live and grow. I started exercising more to (somewhat) manage my anxiety, and I’m pleased to report that I haven’t bitten my nails in several years. I’m no longer dependent on manicures as part of my routine, which strangely frees me to miss them as acts of self-care. With the pandemic forcing me to stay home (which is, I recognize, a privilege), I’ve started missing the pampering of my hands. Enter the Everything Box.\n\nInside this pale pink box is, true to its name, everything you need for a salon-quality manicure, including specific tips and tricks (like how to manage cuticles), six nail colors of your choice (from subtle nudes to splashy neons), and a glossy, quick-drying top coat. As someone who struggles to find polish that isn’t too watery or clumpy, I can vouch for how this polish goes on evenly and stays put for, miraculously, at least a week. The bottle’s brush is just the right size and shape to cover my nail’s surface in two to three strokes (something that gives me trouble with thinner-brush bottles from brands like Essie and Sally Hansen).\n\nBut the best part of the kit, what really makes it the “everything,” are the tools, of which there are many: a nail-polish-remover pot (which you use with a satisfying soak of your finger in a small sponge), a nail clipper (designed with a flat edge for level clipping), a dual-grit nail file (way stronger than my flimsy emery boards), a buffer cube (for shaping, smoothing, and keeping cuticles in line), a universal polish bottle handle (a rubber insert that covers the top of a polish handle and makes it far easier to apply coats, especially when using your nondominant hand), cuticle serum (made with nourishing cactus flower), and a clean-up brush (my personal favorite tool). No matter how messy my manicure is, at the end I use this fine brush dipped in remover to clean up errant polish, and presto, my nails look like they’ve seen the inside of a salon.\n\nRealistically, $80 isn’t financially feasible for everyone. For $50, Olive & June also offers a Studio Box, which comes with all of the tools plus one polish of your choice and a top coat. For $42, you can buy the Tool Box, which includes just the tools, to be paired with any polishes you already own. FWIW, while you can certainly purchase everything in these kits piecemeal, for the price, you get thoughtfully designed, high-quality products and expert advice, all in a pleasing package. With a single bottle of polish usually costing around $7 to $9 a pop, to get six (and a top coat) in colors I love is a good deal. I expect to use the contents of this kit for months to come and am excited to gift it to friends, especially to those who need a pick-me-up. Final verdict? Nailed it.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-11 13:23:38', '/resources/images/SELFfave_ojboxlrg.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/olive-and-june-manicure-box-review', 0, 0);

Since I’m constantly opening packages and typing stories, wearing gel nail polish has been a saving grace when it comes to preserving my mani. While I love the flexibility a regular manicure provides,gel polish is so much more durable—which is why I tend to stretch each manicure for as long as possible.\n\n“With gel polish, your manicure can last from two to three weeks, but with regular polish you\'re lucky if it lasts five to seven days without chipping,” Kristin Pulaski, owner ofPaintbucket Nails in Brooklyn, tells SELF. According to Pulaski, in addition to staying power, another great benefit of gel is that it provides a harder layer of protection over the natural nail, which can result in increased nail growth.\n\nUnfortunately, this durability and protection can be rough on your nails and make them weaker and prone to splitting. No one wants that, so there are a few things to keep in mind to maintain the health of your nails when you’re getting gels. We asked Pulaski, celebrity manicuristSkyy Hadley, and Christy Harpring, co-owner ofSea Salt and Sugar Nail Bar in Savannah, Georgia, to clue us in on gelpolish mistakes to avoid.\n\n## 1. You’re getting gel manicures back-to-back.\n\nSince removing and applying gel nail polish can cause a lot of wear and tear on your nails, you should space out your manicures. “By getting gel nails every two weeks consistently, the nail plate gets extremely suffocated,” explains Hadley. This can lead to nail dehydration and eventually breakage, so make sure to give your nails downtime between gels. “It’s important to have a professional nail technician assess your nail health between applications to determine if your nails could use a sabbatical from polishes,” explains Harpring.\n\n## 2. You’re leaving gel polish on too long.\n\nSince gel nail polish can be worn for weeks on end without even the tiniest chip, stretching the life of your manicure is tempting. However, Hadley suggests removing a gel manicure after two to three weeks maximum to avoid damaging nail beds and cuticles. Harpring agrees, adding that overextending gel manicures can not only lead to weakened nails, but also introduce potentially harmful bacteria. “It is important to remember that once the gel begins to lift, it does allow for moisture to get under the gel and possibly lead to bacterial growth,” explains Harpring.\n\n## 3. You’re removing an old gel manicure without professional help.\n\nOnce a gel manicure is on its last leg, you may be tempted toremove it yourself, but experts advise against it. “The safest way to remove gel polish is by a professional,” says Harpring.\n\nIf you absolutely can’t make it to the salon for removal, she advises you first gently file the top of the polish to remove the shine, which allows the acetone to penetrate and dissolve the gel easier. Next, soak cotton balls in acetone (a chemical commonly used in gel nail polish removal), apply a cotton ball to each nail, and wrap it in tin foil. Leave the wraps on for 10 to 15 minutes, and then, using a wooden cuticle pusher, gently push the gel off of the nail plates. To finish, lightly buff the surface of the nail with a buffing tool, and apply oil to your nails and cuticles to rehydrate.\n\n## 4. You’re not using cuticle oil.\n\nAccording to Hadley, you can assess nail damage based on their flexibility: Normal nails are somewhat flexible, but the harder and sturdier the nail, the more likely it is to break. Sincecold weather tends to make skin drier overall, proper cuticle hydration can make a big difference. Additionally, acetone can be extremely drying to the nail bed, causing nails to break or become brittle over time.\n\nTo combat nail dryness, experts suggest keeping cuticle oil close at hand (no pun intended). “I swear by cuticle oil and personally loveNCLA\'s,” Pulaski tells SELF. “I used to think that cuticle oil wasn\'t essential, but I started using it about two years ago and I always carry it with me now, especially in the colder months!” Adding a few drops of oil to your nails and cuticles in between salon visits will keep them hydrated.\n\nKeeping my nails looking good, with or without polish, is definitely a priority. So while I probably won’t give up on gel nail polish altogether, I’ll definitely think twice before trying to stretch mymanicure for longer than two weeks at a time.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '/resources/images/woman-getting-manicure.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/gel-nail-polish-mistakes', 0, 0);

I totally getblow-drying your hair after a shower, but your *toes*? That just sounded weird.\n\nTurns out, she wasn’t talking about helping your nail polish dry faster (which, actually,doesn’t work, she was talking about preventing foot fungus.\n\nLippman informs me that she actually got the tip from her podiatrist, Ivar Roth, D.P.M., M.P.H., of Concierge Podiatry and Spa. \"Using a blow-dryer is something that I came up with to combat fungus infections of the feet and nails,\" Dr. Roth tells SELF. The rationale is simple, he explains. Fungi grow in moist environments; take away the water, and it helps to stop growth.\n\nWhen you let your feet air-dry, it can take up to 30 minutes for the corners of yournails and the spaces between your toes to dry—these are the places where fungus often begins to grow, Dr. Roth says. Blow-drying cuts that down to around a minute or so, which means there’s less time for fungus to grow, and therefore less chance you’ll walk out of your bathroom or the gym locker room with a budding case ofathlete’s foot.\n\n(Note, if you have decreased sensation to pain or temperature in your toes, fromdiabetic neuropathy or other causes, don\'t try this at home—you could risk burning your skin.)\n\nNYC sports podiatrist Lori Weisenfeld tells SELF the method makes sense. “Fungi like warm, dark places, which is why it’s important to dry between and under toes,” she says. “Your feet dry quickly—it’s between and under toes that act as a reservoir for moisture and fungus.” Yet, she says, many people tend to neglect drying the areas between and under toes after bathing. Dr. Weisenfeld has never advised patients to use a blow-dryer, but always recommends they use a tissue as opposed to their body towel when drying their feet, as using the same towel could potentially spread fungus.\n\nThe standard advice for preventing foot fungus, according to theAmerican Podiatric Medical Association, is to wear shoes that aren’t too tight to provide air flow to feet, as well as changing shoes and socks regularly to keep your feet dry. And if you shower at the gym, you’ll want to invest in a pair ofshower shoes.\n\nOne of the first signs you may be dealing with possible foot fungus?

Even if you’re a DIY pro, at-home manicures never seems to last as long as when the actual pros do it. The simple solution would be to go to the nail salon, but that’s not always time or cost efficient. I decided to talk to six professional manicurists to get their insider tips for a better at-home mani.\n\nIt turns out I was committing a few common faux pas that shorten the lifespan of my mani. And apparently there are a lot of BS tips out there (why am I not surprised…). For example, that trick where you dunk your freshly-painted nails in ice water to quick dry—false. Now, I’m wondering what else I have been doing wrong.\n\nHere are nine ways to keep your nails looking perfect when you DIY your manicure, according to the nail experts.\n\n\\1. Select the right shape.\n\nDespite all the trendy shapes (like the coffin or the stiletto), it turns out that rounded nails are your best bet to avoid rips and snagging. “Due to it’s smooth shape, it’s less likely to catch on things,” says Essie’s global lead educator Rita Remark. “If you prefer to wear your nails square, just make sure to round the edges on either side of the nail.”\n\n\\2. Make sure to buff the edge of your nails.\n\nOnce you land on the final shape, it’s important to make sure nothing is left hanging on the edge. “When nails are filed quite a bit, it\'s important to use a nail buffer to get all remaining nail debris out from under the nail and from the sides of the nail along the cuticle line,” says Carly Narva, a manicure enthusiast and the VP of merchandising at beauty retailer Violet Grey. Another pro tip: Make sure to file in one direction especially with the sides—this ensures you aren’t disturbing the fibers of the nails.\n\n\\3. Prep your nails properly before you paint.\n\nMost nail salons sit you to soak before pushing the cuticles and filing, but the pros say dry manis are more sanitary and help your polish last longer. Remark says soaking in water causes the nail to expand. Then when it dries the nail contracts, causing your polish to chip. Instead, she says, cleanse the nails with nail polish remover or alcohol before polishing.\n\nSome salons will use vinegar for a pre-mani soak, but that’s also a no-go, according to editorial nail technician Honey, who explains that the acid in vinegar could make your nails brittle. “I use vinegar on feet to make sure there is no bacteria, but not usually on the hands. A dry manicure is best,” she says.\n\n\\4. Don’t shake the nail polish bottle.\n\nWe’ve heard this tip time and time again, yet many of us continue to shake our nail polish when it’s separated, and then wonder why we don’t end up with a seamless manicure. “I prefer rolling the polish if I\'m polishing nails immediately,” explains celebrity manicurist for Kiss products, Gina Edwards. Many bottles have a small metal ball inside that helps stir the product around. “Shaking creates bubbles in the polish and can be seen if you apply shortly after,” she says, adding that if you do shake, you should wait an hour before you polish.\n\nHoney uses a roll-and-shake combo. “Some people say not to shake or roll because it makes bubbles in the polish, but I do a combination of the two at the start of a manicure,” she explains. “By the time I am ready to use the color, the bubbles have settled.”\n\n\\5. Two thinner coats are better than one thick coat.\n\nWhile it’s tempting to go for the gusto with one thick coat, don’t. Globs of polish just means longer drying time and a higher risk for smudging. “Thick coats are a no-go!” exclaims nail styling artist Gracie J. “Thin and even coats work best for a seamless look.”\n\nCelebrity manicurist Sarah Chue breaks it down a bit further. “Many thin coats will allow polish to dry in between—use only three layers max of color,” she says. “In general, one layer of base coat, two coats of color, and one layer top coat. Sometimes if you\'d like more pigment or the color seems a bit sheer, a third coat of color is tolerable.”\n\nRemark agrees. “Almost any polish you’ll find on the market is formulated to be polished with two coats, so use this as a rule of thumb for polishing at home,” she says, adding, “if the polish texture is sheer, oftentimes it will look good even with one coat. However, if it’s an opaque color, it will absolutely require at least two coats.”\n\n\\6. Apply product in three strokes.\n\nOne swipe and you’re out? Not so fast. “The professional way to apply is middle then sides,” says Edwards. “However, as long as you get full coverage on the nail, it\'s really a comfort level for the individual.”\n\n\\7. Avoid heat when drying your mani.\n\nAs for drying, air-dry or use a blast of cold—not hot—air to assist. “Heat actually keeps your polish from firming. Cold air does the opposite,” says Chue. “[If you’re in a rush], try quick-dry drops after a few minutes of drying.” For her at-home manicure, Narva likes to wait 5 to 10 minutes and use one drop of Tenoverten\'s Non-Toxic Quick Dry Drops ($18) on each nail, holding hands facing downward so the drop covers the entire nail.\n\n\\8. Fix mistakes ASAP.\n\nGot a little overzealous with polish? It’s a quick fix. “Use a stick with a flat edge, dip it in acetone, and work it around the eponychium after each nail,” explains Gracie J (eponychium is the cuticle area). “That way you don’t wait until the end, when the polish has already dried up in the crevices.”\n\nFor smudges, you can gently use your finger to push polish back into place before adding a layer of top coat. “If it’s beyond fixing, like when you get those dents, it’s best to just wipe it off and re-do,” Gracie J adds.\n\n\\9. Make manicure maintenance an everyday thing.\n\nAfter all your hard work, a few good habits can extend the life of a DIY manicure. “I always recommend that my clients wear gloves when washing dishes or cleaning the house,” shares Gracie J. “I also tell them to use cuticle oil. It helps keep the skin around your nails healthy and promotes healthy nail growth.”\n\nNarva is a huge fan of hand creams—two of her favorites are from Omorovicza and Tatcha. “Both are super hydrating but do not leave an oily finish,” she says.\n\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '/resources/images/woman-doing-her-manicure.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/ways-to-not-ruin-your-at-home-manicure', 0, 0);

Finding the perfectnude nail polish is something that frustrates me every time I go to the salon. Standing in front of that big wall of bottles, I go for the classic shades like Essie Ballet Slippers, but those cotton candy colors don\'t quite mesh with my milk chocolate skin. It\'s not the right nude for me.\n\nThat’s why I reached out to celebrity and editorial manicuristJackie Saulsbery, who has worked with stars like Adele, to put an end to my search once and for all.\n\n“Nude can be several different shades depending on the skin tone,” Saulsbery says. But there are other things to consider, too. “When you’re picking a color, see if you want something to draw the eyes to the hands or if you want something to blend in.” Nude doesn’t have to be boring. You can pick a shade with a grayundertone or something with a touch of shimmer to liven it up.\n\nWith her help, I found my new favorite nude shade (Zoya Pasha, see below), and got her tips to help nail down a nude polish for every complexion—plus application advice for a flawless DIY nude manicure.\n\nSaulsbery has tips to help find a nude polish for every complexion.\n\nFor Fair Skin:\n\n![This image may contain Finger Hand Human and Person](/resources/images/062917_SELF45106.jpg)\n\nKatie Thompson\n\nSaulsbery warns to stay away from pink if you have a fair complexion because it can make skin look ashy or pasty. Instead, look for variations of taupe that are more opaque. Make sure to ask the manicurist if the nail colors on the polish wall are “what you see is what you get.” Sometimes what the color looks like in the bottle doesn’t translate the same on the hand. So be prepared to test a few options.\n\n**On model:** Essie Nail Polish in Sand Tropez ($9,essie.com)\n\n![Image may contain Cosmetics and Bottle](/resources/images/1_nude.jpg)\n\n**Similar shades:** Dior Vernis Nail Lacquer in Palais Royal ($27,sephora.com); CND Vinylux Weekly Polish in Powder My Nose ($11,loxabeauty.com); Zoya Nail Polish in Tatum ($10,zoya.com)\n\nFor Medium Skin:\n\n![Image may contain Human Person Text and Hand](/resources/images/062917_SELF45112.jpg)\n\nKatie Thompson\n\nWhile pink can wash out fair skin, it blends right in on olive skin types.

You can try a polish with a hint of rose if you’re looking for something work appropriate or go for a gray undertone if you’re looking to make it a bit more exciting.\n\n**On model:** Zoya Nail Polish in Pasha ($10,zoya.com)\n\n![Image may contain Cosmetics](/resources/images/3_nude.jpg)\n\n**Similar shades:** Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nail Polish in Totem-ly Yours ($7,target.com); Dior Vernis Nail Lacquer in Incognito ($27,sephora.com); OPI Nail Lacquer in Icelanded a Bottle of OPI ($6,beyondpolish.com)\n\nFor Deep Skin:\n\n![Image may contain Hand Human Person and Finger](/resources/images/062917_SELF45055.jpg)\n\nKatie Thompson\n\nLight, cloudy colors can make nails look fake on dark skin.

Then gently push back the skin around the base of thenail. Instead of cutting your cuticles, Saulsbery recommends using a buffing block to remove the excess skin. Then shape the tip of the nail by brushing a file from corner to center. Make sure to get underneath the free nail as well to get rid of any excess dust under the free edge, which can show up through sheer nude formulas.\n\nBefore applying a basecoat you want to dehydrate the nail with polish remover and rubbing alcohol to get rid of any oil. This helps the manicure last longer. Saulsbery uses theOrly Top2Bottom ($10) as a base and topcoat. “With the nude, you want to make sure that the base is completely dry before you apply the color because nude can drag and it’ll be streaky,” she says. “Then, you find yourself applying coat after coat trying to darken it when all you have to do is just wait a second for the base to dry.”\n\nSaulsbery also uses a special technique to apply polish: First move the brush across the base of the nail from side to side to even out the color near the cuticle. Then pull the color down from base to tip in three strokes. That way you get full coverage without any spots or streaks.', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-11 13:30:52', '/resources/images/062917_SELF45139.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/nude-nail-polish-skin-tone', 0, 0);

Yes, please.', '![This image may contain Jade Alleyne Clothing Apparel Human Person Face Headband Hat Turban and Finger](/resources/images/mggirl1_1024x-1.jpg)Courtesy of #HalalPaint\n\nThese days, nail polish comes in more forms than you can count on one hand: There\'sdip powder, gel, acrylic, chrome,vegan, harsh-chemical-free, the list goes on. The one option that\'s been largely lacking? A polish safe for Muslim prayer, keeping Muslim women who abide by halal guidelines (rules for what is and is not permitted in certain interpretations of Islamic law) from getting into the nail game. But as of today, that\'s about to change: Orly\'s new collaboration withMuslimGirl.com passes prayer standards with flying colors. They\'ve dubbed the six shades#HalalPaint.\n\nFor some Muslim women, traditional nail polish is typically a no-go because it creates a barrier that ritual prayer water can\'t pass through. Not so with #HalalPaint. The capsule collection, which is made with 100 percent halal ingredients that allow oxygen and hydration to pass through and certified by the Islamic Society of the Washington Area, lets everyone deck their nails with breathable color and designs.\n\n![Image may contain Human Person Nazriya Nazim Face and Finger](/resources/images/mggirl3_1024x.jpg)\n\nCourtesy of #HalalPaint\n\nWith brands working todiversify their shades and making headway onrepresentation, the collaboration couldn\'t come at a better time.\n\n\"This line is important because there are so many girls and young women who aren\'t represented in mainstream beauty. They either don’t fit that definition or see things about them that are designed without them, instead of for them and by them,” said Azmia Magane, MuslimGirl.com\'s chief of staff, in a statement. “This is our way of bridging that gap.”\n\n![Image may contain Advertisement Poster Brochure Paper and Flyer](/resources/images/HalalPaint_MGxORLY_1024x1024.png)\n\nCourtesy of #HalalPaint\n\nHalal polish has been a long time coming—as the brand says, \"The Muslim Girl x Orly collaboration is the first of many ways to cater to [Muslim women\'s] needs and count them in.\" Reason enough to celebrate the collection, but even if you\'re not looking for a halal-OKed polish, the range is worth looking into.

This article is for those that are looking for reasons to keep drinking it.\n\nAfter all, you may have a caffeine-hater in your life. You know the type – they’re always telling you what’s bad for your health.\n\nHere’s a list of some good reasons to drink coffee. Memorize this list – so the next time you encounter your favorite coffee-hater you can pull out one of these babies.\n\nWhile you’re at it, you can add the words “*from a peer-reviewed scientific journal*” — that’ll really get your pet coffee-hater frothing at the mouth.\n\n**In all seriousness, here are some scientific reasons for drinking coffee in moderation.**\n\n## Top 11 Coffee Health Benefits\n\n1. **Cut the Pain**\n   Two cups of coffee can cut post-workout muscle pain by up to 48%. *From the Journal of Pain, March 2007 (link)*\n2. **Increase your fiber intake**\n   A cup of brewed coffee represents a contribution of up to 1.8 grams of fiber of the recommended intake of 20-38 grams. *From the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry (link).*\n3. **Protection against cirrhosis of the liver**\n   Of course, you could just cut down on the alcohol intake. *From the Archives of Internal Medicine (link)*. Another more recent study also showed coffee’s liver protecting benefits. link. Yet another study showed that both coffee and decaffeinated coffee lowered the liver enzyme levels of coffee drinkers. This study was published in the Hepatology Journal.\n4. **Lowered risk of Type 2 Diabetes**\n   Those who consumed 6 or more cups per day had a 22% lower risk of diabetes. *From the Archives of Internal Medicine (link)*. A recent review of research conducted by Harvard’s Dr. Frank Hu showed that the risk of type II diabetes decreases by 9% for each daily cup of coffee consumed. Decaf coffee decreased risk by 6% per cup.\n5. **Lowered risk of Alzheimer’s disease**\n   There is considerable evidence that caffeine may protect against Alzheimer’s disease. *From the European Journal of Neurology (link).*\n6. **Reduces suicide risk and Depression**\n   A 10-year study of 86,000 female nurses shows a reduced risk of suicide in the coffee drinkers. *From the Archives of Internal Medicine (link)*. Another study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that women who drink 4 or more cups of coffee were 20% less likely to suffer from depression. *Study link*.\n7. **Protection against Parkinson’s**People with Parkinson’s disease are less likely to be smokers and coffee drinkers than their healthy siblings. Just make sure you don’t get lung cancer on the way. *From the Archives of Neurology (link).* Even newer research out of Sweden revealed that drinking coffee reduces the risk of Parkinson’s even when genetic factors come into play. \n8. **Coffee drinkers have less risk of heart disease.** Korean researchers found that study participants who consumed 3 to 5 cups of coffee a day were less likely to show the beginning signs of heart disease. The study. *Other dietary factors should also be noted as Koreans typically have a different diet than do Westerners. *A more recent study conducted in Brazil found that those that consume at least three cups of coffee a day tend to develop less calcification in their coronary arteries.\n9. **Coffee drinkers have stronger DNA**. A study published in the European Journal of Nutrition showed that coffee drinkers have DNA with stronger integrity since the white blood cells of coffee drinkers had far less instance of spontaneous DNA strand breakage. Study abstract.\n10. **Lower Risk of Multiple Sclerosis**. Recent research showed that at least 4 cups of coffee a day may help protect against the development and reoccurrence of MS. It is believed that the coffee prevents the neural inflammation that possibly leads to the disease developing. The study was published in the* Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry.*\n11. **Coffee reduces colorectal cancer risk**. Even moderate consumption of coffee can reduce the odds of developing colorectal cancer by 26%. This protective benefit increases with more consumption. The study is described in detail here.\n\n> Recent research has also shown that coffee may boost a woman’s sex drive, but the fact that it’s only been tested on rats somehow takes the shine off.\n\n### Even More Reasons to Drink Coffee…\n\nNew research concerning coffee and health is being conducted all the time. Here are some more of the latest studies.\n\n1. **Reduced Liver Cancer Risk:** Researchers at USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center found that those that consume 1-3 cups of coffee a day have a 29% reduced risk of developing liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the most common type. Src.\n2. **Less Gout Risk:** Yet another reason: Risk for developing gout (in men) decreases with increasing coffee consumption. This is a large study of over 50,000 men (link).\n3. **Longevity:** Greek boiled coffee linked to longevity and heart health. –link. Another study published in the June 17, 2008, issue of the *Annals of Internal Medicine *howed that women who consume coffee had a lower risk of death from cancer, heart disease, and other factors, which therefore promotes a longer lifespan. Yet another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that coffee drinkers were at less risk of dying prematurely from diseases like diabetes, heart disease and forms of cancer. *Study link*. Another study from Japan found that men who drink at least 3 cups of coffee per day have a 24% less risk of dying early from disease. Yet another study from Harvard also confirmed that those who drink 1-5 cups of coffee a day avoid diseases linked to premature death. The study. A Japanese-based study also found similar results when it comes to coffee and longevity. The study. Two more 2017 research studies have confirmed what earlier studies have found. Those that drink coffee live longer than those who don’t. The American study is found here and the European-based study is found here.\n4. **Prevents Retinal Damage**. A Cornell University Study showed that coffee may prevent retinal damage due to oxidative stress. Caffeine isn’t the culprit here, but chlorogenic acid (CLA), which is one of the strong antioxidants found in the coffee bean. link\n5. **Black coffee prevents cavities**. Researchers out of Brazil found that strong black coffee kills the bacteria on teeth that leads to tooth decay. Adding milk or sugar to coffee negates this benefit. –link\n6. **Coffee may protect against periodontal disease**. As part of the US Department of Veterans Affairs Dental Longitudinal Study coffee consumption and dental health among 1,152 men was tracked from 1968-1998. The researchers found that coffee didn’t promote gum disease and actually showed a protective benefit. Link\n7. **Coffee may protect against melanoma**. A study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that melanoma risk decreases with coffee consumption and that this risk decreases with each cup consumed. *Study link*.\n8. **The USDA’s new 2015 dietary guidelines recommend it for better health**. They advise people that having 3 to 5 cups of coffee a day is good for their overall health and reduces the risk of disease. However, they report that adding sugar, cream, or flavored creamers quickly negates the potential benefits. The complete report here.(pdf)\n9. **Reduced heart attack mortality risk**. Researchers found that those who drink two or more cups of coffee daily after having a heart attack have the least risk of dying from the heart attack. The study.\n10. **Helps people get along with co-workers better.** A study published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology showed that workers/ workplaces who consume coffee have a more positive view of self and others than do workers/ workspaces that do not consume coffee. Coffee consumption also enhanced participation in workplace group activities.\n\n## Coffee’s Health Promoting Antioxidants\n\nCoffee Berries\n\nCoffee’s health promoting properties are likely due to the antioxidants naturally occurring in the coffee bean.\n\n- A typical serving of coffee contains **more antioxidants** than typical serving**s** of grape juice, blueberries, raspberries, and oranges.\n- Antioxidants in coffee may dampen inflammation, reducing the risk of disorders related to it, like cardiovascular disease.\n- A study from Monash University even further demonstrated the antioxidant capacities of brewed coffee.\n\n**Just drink decaf then?**\n\nWhile there are still some health benefits to drinking decaf coffee, most of the above studies showed that caffeinated coffee had the greatest benefits.\n\nThis is due to many of the antioxidants being removed during the decaffeination process.\n\n### How Safe or Beneficial is Coffee Then?\n\nFor most people, coffee can be a healthy part of the diet. It is fine to enjoy a couple of cups a day unless you can’t control your consumption.\n\nHowever, coffee may not be beneficial for everyone. Those with certain heart conditions, caffeine sensitivity, and woman who are pregnant should stick to decaf or tea.\n\nAlso, those that drink coffee in excess may be negating some of the benefits because of the large amounts of caffeine they are consuming. These people may benefit from a caffeine detox to reset their caffeine tolerance to more moderate levels.\n\nThe key is moderation, which is typically 2-3 cups a day, to get the coffee health benefits but avoid the negative issues associated with too much caffeine.', 0, '2021-03-11 16:49:49', '2021-03-11 16:49:50', '/resources/images/Reasons-to-drink-coffee-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/7-good-reasons-to-drink-coffee.html', 1, 0);

(Understanding your Total Daily Energy Expenditure andtracking what you eat for awhile is even better.\n\nThe most obvious way to make your coffee less calorific is to simply switch to black coffee, however, this is easier said than done. Many just don’t like drinking black coffee. Here are some tips to enjoy a creamy coffee but with fewer calories.\n\n1. **Ask for 2% or skim milk when ordering your coffee drink**. Many coffee shops use whole milk by default.\n2. **Use lactose-free milk:** Lactose is the sugar in milk but the human tongue doesn’t taste lactose as very sweet. When companies sell lactose-free milk, they simply add the lactase enzyme to milk which breaks down the lactose into simpler sugars which your tongue can better taste. When you use lactose-free milk, the coffee will naturally taste sweeter even though the sugar content hasn’t changed.\n3. **Ask for sugar-free flavorings and syrups.** These have come a long way over the years and many taste great without adding calories.\n4. **Avoid the ice cream based coffee drinks.** These are much higher in calories than frozen coffee drinks that use crushed ice.\n5. **Don’t be afraid of cream.** Adding a tablespoon of cream to your brewed 12 fl oz coffee only adds 52 calories while a Tall Starbucks Latte is 180 calories. If you like a creamy coffee choose a brewed coffee or an Americano with cream instead of a milk-based espresso drink.\n\nBeyond the negative effects that all those calories have on maintaining a healthy weight, the excess sugar in many coffee drinks is also a menace to one’s health.\n\nMore and moreresearch shows that eating large amounts of sugar is linked to all kinds of diseases.\n\n', 0, '2021-03-11 16:52:07', '2021-03-11 16:52:09', '/resources/images/Calorie-Laden-Coffees-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/coffees-with-crazy-calories.html', 1, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (92, 12, 'Coffee Lovers Diet: The Key to Health and Weight Loss?', 'Dr. Arnott\'s The Coffee Diet claims that if people change the way they drink coffee, they can change their lives. Is this true or just marketing hyperbole?', '![the coffee lovers diet by Dr. Bob Arnot](/resources/images/coffee-lovers-diet-Arnott.jpg)\n\nWe recently stumbled across a new book calledThe Coffee Lover’s Diet: Change Your Coffee, Change Your Life and were instantly intrigued by the concept.\n\nThe book’s author isDr. Bob Arnot, who is a physician and was previously a medical correspondent for TV networks such as NBC and CBS. His idea for writing the book came from his investigation on theIkarians who are some of the oldest living people on the planet and the coffee that they typically drink.\n\nThey drink coffee differently than most people in the west. Their coffee isGreek coffee which is finely ground and boiled before serving. This coupled with their lifestyle and a Mediterranean diet is believed to be the source of their longevity.\n\n### Change Your Coffee, Change Your Life?\n\nDr. Arnot believes that if westerners change the way they drink their coffee, they too can help unlock coffee’s true potential for delivering better health and longevity.\n\nHe believes this starts by selecting the right coffee beans and the right roast.High-phenol (high-antioxidant) beans should be selected and they should only be lightly roasted so that they retain the most phenols.¹\n\nThe next step is to prepare the coffee similar to the Greeks. Grind the beans correctly, use the best water temperature for extraction, and favor methods that have a longer extraction time.\n\nHowever, people should avoid using sugar or dairy in their coffee and he believes they won’t miss it since high-phenol coffee tastes much better black than does the poor quality coffee most people are used to drinking.\n\nDr. Arnot believes that if people start drinking coffee this way they will notice dramatic changes in their moods, energy levels, and overall better health.\n\n### His Study\n\nIn conjunction with Dr. David Nieman fromNorth Carolina Reseach Campus, a double-blind placebo-controlled trial was developed to test the effectiveness of high phenol coffee.\n\nAccording to the first chapter of the book, one group of participants were given high-phenol caffeinated coffee and the other where given low-phenol decaffeinated coffee (placebo). They continued using either for 2 weeks. After a short washout period, the two groups were given the opposite sample for two weeks.\n\nThe participants’ TDM (total mood disturbance) was then measured before and 30 minutes after the dose. Those that consumed the high-phenol caffeinated coffee reported energy, liveliness, and more positive mood.\n\n### The Diet\n\nAs far as dietary recommendations to lose weight the book is pretty standard. Dr. Arnot starts by explaining how high-phenol coffee and caffeine in general aid in fat loss byspeeding up the metabolism and by helping the body utilize stored fat for energy.\n\nBesides drinking high-quality coffee, a diet rich in plant-based foods is encouraged, as well as some lean protein. Many ofthe principles of the Mediterranean diet are recommended. By avoiding processed foods, added sugar and other refined carbs, dieters will naturally reduce their calorie intake and lose weight.\n\n### Problems With The Coffee Lover’s Diet?\n\nThe most glaringly obvious problem with the diet is his faulty study. He had one group consume caffeinated high-phenol coffee and the other group (placebo) consume decaffeinated low-phenol coffee. Anyone who has ever studiedthe scientific method knows that a valid study can only test for ONE variable at a time. His study actually had TWO variables; caffeine and phenols (CGA).\n\nHe should have used caffeinated high-phenol coffee and a placebo of caffeinated low-phenol coffee as his placebo. Of course, the people who had the caffeinated coffee were going to report better mood, energy, and productivity since that’s what caffeine does. The decaf group, of course, weregoing to feel lousy especially if they had previously been caffeinated coffee drinkers…\n\nDr. Arnot sells his own brand of high-phenol coffee (Dr. Danger Coffee), so there is a potential conflict of interest. Arnot has alsofiled a patent on the high-phenol method of making coffee.\n\nI wouldn’t argue that high-phenol coffee is better for one’s health than low-phenol coffee because antioxidants are one of the key factors in coffee’s health promoting effects, but people would notice these benefits over time, not immediately.\n\nDr. Arnot says that people feel better immediately after his coffee when compared to the their normal coffee drink. The problem with that logic is that Greek style coffee also has more caffeine per ounce than western brewed coffee. So if people suddenly switch from one to the other, they will feel a difference because of the caffeine levels.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that traditionally both Greek andTurkish-style coffee are served with sugar and can be pretty sweet. I would assume that the Ikarians also consumed their coffee this way (although cannot verify this).\n\n## Final Conclusions\n\nHealthy eating and getting more antioxidants through natural products like coffee does have a positive influence on one’s mind, weight, and longevity. But, Dr. Arnot’s diet would have a little more credibility if he didn’t have his own brand of coffee attached to it and if he conducted scientifically valid studies to support his theory.\n\nIf you love coffee, it can be part of a healthy diet and if nothing else, the book does show people how to get the mosthealth benefits out of their coffee by altering their brewing technique as well as selecting higher quality coffees.\n\nThere’s also no reason why a person can’t add a little cream and sugar to their coffee if desired. This doesn’t change the antioxidant factor of the coffee and typically adds only a few calories. It’s far more important for people to cut out sugary drinks like soda and even fruit juice than it would be to skip the teaspoon of sugar and splash of cream in their coffee.\n\n', 0, '2021-03-11 16:53:04', '2021-03-11 16:53:06', '/resources/images/coffee-lovers-diet-Arnott-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/coffee-lovers-diet.html', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (93, 12, 'Caffeine and Sleep: Keep It From Stealing Yours', 'Caffeine combats sleep and feeling tired, but it can actually prevent people from getting a good night\'s sleep. Here\'s how you can prevent this.', 'Caffeine is prized because it combats sleep and feeling tired, but this can be a double-edged sword.\n\n![sleep and caffeine](/resources/images/cant-sleep.jpg)\n\nCaffeine can actually prevent people from getting a good night’s sleep1, which means that even more caffeine is needed the following morning to feel functional.\n\n**This can become a vicious cycle if a caffeine user isn’t careful.**\n\n*Here’s how you can be sure to not let caffeine rob you of your precious sleep.*\n\n## How Caffeine Prevents Sleep\n\nCaffeine primarily prevents sleep byblocking adenosine receptors in the brain. Basically, adenosine is the neurotransmitter that signals the brain that the body is tired and in need of rest.\n\nCaffeine fits nicely into these receptors and prevents adenosine from doing its job. As long as there is a steady supply of caffeine flooding the receptors, sleep will be hampered.\n\nSome may still be able to fall asleep even though caffeine is still blocking the adenosine receptors, but this sleep is usually shallow and restless.\n\n### Caffeine Disrupts Circadian Rhythm\n\nNot only does caffeine block adenosine receptors, but if it is consumed too close to bedtime, it can throw a person’s entire circadian rhythm off.\n\nResearchers from theMRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology7 in the UK found that when study participants were given 200 mg of caffeine 3 hours prior to bedtime, the caffeine delayed their normal circadian sleep pattern by 40 minutes. Participants who also were exposed to bright light along with the caffeine had their sleep cycle delayed by 105 minutes.\n\n**Not only does this affect how well you fall asleep but also how good you feel the next morning.**\n\n### Why Sleep Is Important\n\nFor humans, sleep is a necessity.2 Sleep is when much of your body’s repair and rejuvenation processes take place. Adults should get 7-8 hours of sleep a night and children still developing should get 9+ hours of sleep each night.\n\nIn fact, one of the main reasons excessive caffeine isn’t recommended for children is because sleep is so vital for proper brain development and caffeine can interfere with the duration and quality of sleep a child needs to get.3\n\nLack of quality sleep is also linked to obesity, mental illness, high blood pressure, and stress.4 Therefore, it is crucial that you get plenty of rest if you want to be in the best health that you can be.\n\n![sleep and good health](/resources/images/healthy-sleep.jpg)\n\n## How To Stop Caffeine From Stealing Your Sleep\n\nUnfortunately, caffeine and lack of sleep all too often form a vicious cycle. People often consume caffeine because they don’t get enough sleep and then caffeine prevents them from getting the amount and quality of sleep they require to feel awake and energized.\n\n>Active Edge has developed a sleep shirt that uses low-wave frequency technology to improve the quality of sleep. This could also be something to try if caffeine is affecting your quality of sleep.\n\nHowever, there are some steps that you can take to break the cycle and still get adequate sleep while using caffeine. Really heavy caffeine usersmay benefit from a caffeine detox prior to these steps in order to reset their tolerance to caffeine.\n\n**First, don’t consume caffeine too late in the afternoon.**5 If you want to get to bed at 10, then you should probably avoid caffeine after 12 noon. If at noon you consumed 200 mg of caffeine, based oncaffeine’s half-life of 5.7 hours, you would still have over 50 mg in your system at 10 pm.\n\nPlus, this doesn’t account for any caffeine you consumed earlier in the day, which is also still being processed. If you havea high sensitivity orlow built up tolerance to caffeine you may need to stop your consumption even earlier.\n\n**Secondly, know your personal safe daily dose of caffeine and avoid having more than that.** You can find this by usingour caffeine calculator, but for most people it is between 300-400 mg per day. Insomnia is one ofthe leading caffeine overdose symptoms and can prevent you from getting the sleep you need.\n\n**Finally, don’t consume caffeine as soon as you wake up in the morning.** Research shows6 that caffeine works best when taken 1-2 hours after waking. When we first wake up, our bodies are in a natural awakening state.\n\nIf you wait and consume caffeine after this awakening state is wearing off, it will be much more effective in helping you feel alert and productive. Additionally, it will help keep you from consuming too much caffeine, which would interfere with your sleep the following night.\n\n![tired](/resources/images/4896025102_1fb83becf3_o.jpg)\n\n### Signs Caffeine is Preventing Sleep\n\nIf you aren’t sleeping well and aren’t sure whether caffeine is interfering with your sleep or not, here are some things to look for.\n\n1. Do you have trouble falling asleep?\n2. Do you fall asleep but wake back up shortly after?\n3. Do you sleep but wake up often throughout the night?\n4. Do you toss and turn a lot while you sleep?\n5. Do you often use sleeping pills to help you get to sleep?\n\nThese all can be indicators that the caffeine still in your system is preventing you from sleeping properly. If you can identify with any of these, you should take the steps mentioned above to more properly manage your caffeine consumption.\n\nWhile caffeine can be useful for helping us be more alert and productive during our busy lives, it can interfere with our sleep. By practicing a little caffeine hygiene, you will be promoting better sleep hygiene as well.', 0, '2021-03-11 17:03:47', '2021-03-11 17:03:51', '/resources/images/cant-sleep-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/caffeine-and-sleep.html', 0, 0);

We outline 10 of the caffeine-coffee-cancer studies conducted.', '![cancer-caffeine-coffee](/resources/images/cancer-caffeine-coffee.jpg)\n\n### Does Coffee Cause or Prevent Cancer?\n\nJust decades ago doctors and health professionals were warning about the dangers of having too much coffee because of therisk that caffeine was thought to have on the body.\n\nHowever, the last decade has shed a lot of light onthe health benefits of coffee and its relationship to cancer.\n\nMany decade or more long studies have been coming to a close and the results have been changing everything the medical profession thought they knew about coffee and how it influences the risks of getting cancer.\n\nStudy after study has been showing the cancer fighting properties of coffee because of the rich antioxidants it contains.\n\nIn fact, with most studies we aren’t just talking a cup or two a day since most studies show greater benefit when four or more caffeinated coffees are consumed daily.\n\n## Recent Caffeine, Coffee, and Cancer Studies\n\nHere are just a few of the studies that support the notion that caffeinated coffee reduces risk of certain types of cancer.\n\n1. **Oral Cancer:**More than 4 cups of coffee a day decrease oral and head cancers by 39%.\n2. **Uterine Cancer:** Woman who drink more than two cups of coffee a day have less chance of uterine cancer.\n3. **Prostate Cancer:**Men who have 6 cups of coffee a day reduce their prostate cancer risk by 60%.\n4. **Brain Cancer:**At least 5 cups of coffee prevents certain types of brain cancer by 40%.\n5. **Colon Cancer:**At least 2 cups of coffee a day can cut colon cancer risk. A newer study showed that colon cancer patients who drank four or more servings of coffee a day were 42% less likely to have bowel cancer recurrence after surgery and treatment. This study was conducted by theDana-Farber Cancer Institute. An evennewer study also supported this previous research regarding the reduced risk of colorectal cancer among coffee drinkers.\n6. **Breast Cancer:**At least 3 cups of coffee a day can prevent or delay the onset of certain types of breast cancer. Another study showed that at least 2 cups of coffee consumed along side the breast cancer drug tamoxifen, resulted in 49% less early breast cancer recurrence among breast cancer patients in Sweden.\n7. **Liver Cancer:**Coffee drinkers have 41% less instance of liver cancer. A more recent study showed that 1-3 cups of coffee a day reduces risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma by 29%.Link\n8. **Endometrial Cancer**: Women who consume at least 3 cups of coffee a day have a 19% decreased risk of developing endometrial cancer, which claims the lives of about 10,000 women in the USA each year.The research.\n9. **Caffeine protects against lung cancer**. A new study published in the Experimental Hematology & Oncology journal showed that caffeine inhibits a couple of proteins found in lung cancer cells, which in turn prevents the cell’s growth and reproduction.The study.\n10. **Skin Cancer**: A recent study published in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute found that caffeinated coffee drinkers were less likely to develop melanoma. The more coffee people consumed the less risk was observed.Study abstract.\n\n### Caffeinated Coffee as Part of a Healthy Diet\n\nWhile the coffee/cancer research isn’t definitive, it does reveal that drinking coffee is probably far more beneficial than harmful as long as the person canmetabolize caffeine correctly and doesn’t suffer from acaffeine allergy or fromexcessive use.\n\nIn most of the studies, it was found that decaffeinated coffee didn’t appear to have the same effect, which is probably due to the decaffeinating process removing many of the antioxidants.\n\nHowever, we would suspect that people who eat poor quality food and engage in unhealthy habits such as smoking and excessive drinking would not likely experience the cancer fighting properties coffee has to offer.\n\nBut, coffee as part of a healthy diet rich in fresh vegetables and fruit will most likely have the greatest anticancer benefits.\n\nPeople should also note that because ofthe caffeine in coffee, moderation is also recommended and less than 400mg of caffeine from all sources a day seems to bea safe level for most healthy adults.\n\nThe World Health Organization recently removed coffee from their list of possible carcinogens. They cited that there is an overwhelming amount of research that coffee can promote health and actually inhibit cancer. However, they did note that drinking coffee at temperatures in excess of 140 degrees Fahrenheit can increase the risk of cancers of the throat and esophagus. This temperature is much higher than which coffee is typically consumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n', 0, '2021-03-11 17:21:00', '2021-03-11 17:21:02', '/resources/images/coffee-prevents-cancer.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/caffeinated-coffee-the-anti-cancer-wonder-drug.html', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (95, 12, 'Caffeine and Dehydration: What the Research Says', 'What the research says about the dehydrating effect of caffeine. It can act as a diuretic, but only in certain circumstances. Here\'s what you should know.', 'There seems to be a lot of confusion as to whether or not caffeine causes dehydration.\n\n![dehydration and caffeine](/resources/images/restrooms.jpg)\n\nThis stems mainly from caffeine’s classification as a diuretic, but to determine the overall dehydrating effect of caffeine, there are a few other factors involved.\n\nAlso, I think based on many people’s personal experience, they can attest that whenever they drink their morning coffee, frequent trips to the bathroom ensue. Thus, coffee must be dehydrating them **-or-** is it?\n\n### Caffeine as a Diuretic\n\nCaffeine can elicit extra water secretion by the kidneys or in other words acts as adiuretic, which by definition means “*Something that promotes the formation of urine by the kidney*.”\n\nHowever,a recent study 1 showed that only doses of 360 mg of caffeine or greater produced significantly more urine volume.\n\nAnother study 2 noted thatbuilt up caffeine tolerance also influences how well caffeine works as a diuretic. For **those without built up tolerance to caffeine the diuretic effect of caffeine was more prominent**.\n\nYetanother study 3 found that consuming caffeine prior to exercise negated the diuretic effect of caffeine as compared to consuming caffeine and then resting.\n\nIn contrary,this study 4 looked atenergy drink consumption and how caffeine and/or otherenergy drink ingredients like taurine influenced dehydration. They found that the testing group that received the caffeinated energy drinks had significantly more urine output than those that received no caffeine or just taurine only drinks. These subjects were already in a dehydrated state.\n\nTherefore, based on the research, caffeine is a diuretic but **not a very efficient one** since there are several factors that determine how well it actually works in this capacity.\n\n![dehydration](/resources/images/dehydration.jpg)\n\n## Does Caffeine Dehydrate?\n\n**So the question then remains, does caffeine dehydrate a person or not?**\n\nIf 400 mg of caffeine were consumed (as caffeine pills or energy shot) *without* drinking other fluids along with the dose, then there may be an overall dehydrating effect (as long as the person wasn’t overly tolerant to caffeine).\n\nYet most people consume caffeine in the form ofcoffee, tea, energy drinks, or soda, so what about in those cases?\n\nThe study mentioned above 4 looked at energy drink consumption and how caffeine and/or other energy drink ingredients like taurine influenced dehydration. They found that caffeine laced energy drinks did further dehydrate already dehydrated test subjects, but there was no adjusting for the subject’s tolerance to caffeine.\n\nAnotherresearch study 5 looked at all kinds of drinks like coffee, tea, soda, juice, water etc. and they concluded that there was “*no significant differences in the effect of various combinations of beverages on hydration status of healthy adult males. Advising people to disregard caffeinated beverages as part of the daily fluid intake is not substantiated by the results of this study*.”\n\nA more recent study (2014) 6 found that there was **no significant difference in hydration status between caffeine habituated males who consumed coffee in moderation with those that consumed just water**.\n\n![coffee and urination](/resources/images/stone-dog-194453_1280.jpg)\n\n**Then why does coffee make me have to pee?**\n\nThere are possibly a couple of reasons for this. Firstly, if you are already in a hydrated state any additional fluids will cause increased urine production. So, a 12-16 fl oz (355-500 ml) coffee will produce about the same amount of urine output.\n\nSecondly, if you aren’t a regular coffee or caffeine consumer then large amounts of caffeine does have a diuretic or dehydrating effect, thus increasing urine volume.\n\nLastly, caffeine can causeincontinence in some men and women. This causes the urge to urinate even if the bladder isn’t yet full. 7,8\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\nIf you are a regular consumer of caffeinated beverages then you needn’t worry about dehydration as long as you are consuming adequate fluid amounts in general.\n\nThis study 9 analyzed all valid studies on caffeine and dehydration prior to 2003.\n\n**Here’s what they concluded:**\n\n> *The most ecologically valid of the published studies offers no support for the suggestion that consumption of caffeine-containing beverages as part of a normal lifestyle leads to fluid loss in excess of the volume ingested or is associated with poor hydration status. Therefore, there would appear to be no clear basis for refraining from caffeine containing drinks in situations where fluid balance might be compromised.*\n\n**Therefore, coffee or tea and even soft drinks and energy drinks can be used as a way to hydrate the body and do not dehydrate.**\n\nHowever, consumers should keep in minddaily caffeine safety amounts,sugar consumption levels, and the health benefits of drinking plenty of plain water.', 0, '2021-03-11 17:22:18', '2021-03-11 17:22:20', '/resources/images/dehydration-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/caffeine-and-dehydration.html', 0, 0);

Your long-term good health could depend on it.', '![quitting coffee benefits](/resources/images/10218535933_4599e2a93f_o.jpg)\nBillions of people worldwide drink coffee or some form of caffeine every day.\n\n\n\nAlthough caffeine is generally accepted as safe for consumption in moderation, there are some solid benefits to breaking the habit and quitting coffee, energy drinks, tea, soda etc..\n\n### 1. Break the Addiction\n\nIn most peoplecaffeine is an addictive substance to some degree, although some would describe it as *highly addictive*.\n\nDepending on a substance to function normally or even stay awake, can become a vicious cycle. It changes our brain’s chemistry resulting in the need for more of the substance to achieve the desired results.\n\n*Quitting caffeine or coffee breaks the cycle and frees us from needing a daily drug to function normally.*\n\n### 2. Financial Savings\n\nThe cost of a caffeine addiction can add up and thousands of dollars a year could be saved if you quit.\n\n-A Grande Starbucks Latte: $3.65 a day | $26 a week | **$1,332 a year**\n-Monster Energy Drink: $3 a day | $21 a week | **$1,095 a year**\n-Home brewed coffee: $.71 a day | $5 per week | **$259 a year**\n-K-cups: $.65 a day | $4.55 a week | **$237 a year**\n-5 hour energy: $3 a day | $21 a week | **$1,095 a year**\n\n*Lendingtree.com has a helpful calculator that shows you exactly how much you’re spending on your beverage of choice.*\n\nAbove we have listed the average cost of just one beverage a day, now multiply that by the number you have each day and it quickly adds up.\n\n### 3. Lower Blood Pressure\n\nCaffeine can raise your blood pressure a few points and even more in some people.1\n\nQuitting coffee or caffeine can lower your blood pressure and keep your heart from working as hard.\n![ better sleep](/resources/images/caffeine-cleanse-sleep.jpg)\n\n### 4. Better Sleep\n\nCaffeine can greatly reduce the amount and quality of sleep.2 Drinking coffee or energy drinks too late in the day can interfere with getting to sleep since thehalf-life of caffeine is 4-6 hours.\n\nEven people who have no caffeine after 12 noon report a better quality of sleep after quitting caffeine.\n\n### 5. Better Mood\n\nCaffeine alters the mood. Many report being grumpy until they’ve had their morning coffee and others feel lethargic when the caffeine begins to wear off in the afternoon.\n\n*Quitting can even out the ups and downs.*\n\n### 6. Decreased Anxiety\n\nMany people report that caffeine increases their anxiety levels. This has to do with howcaffeine stimulates the adrenal glands.3\n\nQuitting coffee or caffeine can make you feel less anxious, especially if you are prone to anxiety issues.\n\n### 7. Fewer Headaches\n\nCaffeine is a major trigger for headaches. Any alteration in your normal daily caffeine consumption can result in a caffeine withdrawal headache.\n\nCaffeine can also be a migraine trigger.\n\n### 8. Convenience\n\n- Imagine never having to stop at Starbucks on the way to work?\n- Imagine never having to stop by the convenience store for a Red Bull?\n- Imagine erasing making coffee from your morning routine?\n- Imagine a backpacking trip without packing caffeine pills or the extra weight of coffee making equipment?\n\nBeing addicted to coffee, energy drinks, or soda creates inconvenience in our lives since we need the drug to function.\n\n![bathrooms](/resources/images/6242264195_cd717bc643_o.jpg)\n\n### 9. Fewer Trips to the Bathroom\n\nCaffeinated beverages cause us to urinate more often and in some people even cancause incontinence.\n\nCaffeine also stimulates the smooth muscles of the colon, which cause them to contract.\n\n*This can be challenging during meetings, road trips, or when bathrooms aren’t convenient.*\n\nQuitting can reduce the need to use the bathroom as often, especially in the mornings.\n\n### 10. Healthier Teeth\n\nCoffee and tea stain teeth and acidic & sweet energy drinks or sodas erode tooth enamel and can cause tooth decay.\n\nEliminating these beverages results in whiter and healthier teeth.\n\n### 11. Weight Loss\n\nUnless you drink your coffee black. Caffeinated beverages generally add empty calories to our diets that we don’t really need.\n\nMany experts say thatsugary beverages are a huge component of the obesity epidemic plaguing the western world.4\n\nA study from Victoria University found that when caffeine is in a sugary beverage it causes people to consumed more of that sugary beverage compared to a sugary beverage without caffeine.5\n\n- Quitting just a one Monster Energy Drink/day habit saves 200 calories per day, 1,400 calories a week, or **73,000 calories a year**!\n- Quitting just 1 Starbucks Vanilla Latte/day saves 250 calories per day, 1,750 calories a week, or **91,250 calories a year**!\n- Quitting a 16 fl.oz. Coke/day habit saves 239 calories a day, 1,673 calories a week, or **87,235 calories a year**!\n\n1 pound of fat contains the equivalent of 3500 calories, so do the math…\n\n### 12. Healthier Diet\n\nBottled coffees, teas, energy drinks, and sodas often containan assortment of preservatives designed to give them a longer shelf-life.\n\nThese preservatives can have adverse health effects andsome are even banned by other countries.\n\nSugar-free energy drinks and sodas contain artificial sweeteners that also can negatively affect your health.\n\nCutting these out of your diet can be beneficial to your overall long-term good health.\n\n![waste and litter](/resources/images/8874662530_cdd866802e_k.jpg)\n\n### 13. Cleaner Environment\n\nCaffeine addiction places a tremendous strain on our natural resources. Think of the number of plastic bottles, cans, and cups that have to be produced in order to meet the demand.\n\n> “*Americans discard about 33.6 million tons of plastic each year, but only 6.5 percent of it is recycled and 7.7 percent is combusted in waste-to-energy facilities, which create electricity or heat from garbage. The rest ends up in landfills where it may take up to 1,000 years to decompose.*.” –State of The Planet\n\nAlso,caffeine has been showing up in municipal water supplies because of all the discarded coffee grounds.\n\n*Quitting caffeine reduces your environmental footprint.*\n\n### 14. Caffeine Will Work Again\n\nConsuming caffeine daily quickly causes the human body to build up tolerance. The same dose of caffeine then causes a person to achieve a sense of normal rather than the euphoric feelings it once did.\n\nQuitting resets your body’s caffeine tolerance, allowing it to work really well on the occasions you really need it to.\n\n### 15. Possible Drug Interactions\n\nCaffeine can interact with other medications causing them to not work as they should.\n\n*Giving up caffeine eliminates this risk.*\n\n![heart-arrhythmia caffeine safety](/resources/images/heart-arrhythmia.jpg)\n\n### 16. No More Jitters\n\nOne of the leading side-effects of caffeine or coffee consumption is jitters or shaky hands. This can range from annoying to even debilitating for some people.\n\n*Quitting can give you your steady hands back.*\n\n### 17. Less Risk of Cardiac Events\n\nCaffeine stimulates the heart musclecausing it to beat with more forceful contractions.\n\nWhile this isn’t problematic for most people, those with underlying heart conditions can be at risk. People can be unaware that they even have a heart disorder until they begin to consume caffeine and the damage is done.\n\n### 18. Increased Productivity\n\n**What would you do with an extra hour every day?** Those addicted to caffeine can easily waste an hour standing in line at the coffee shop, making trips to the break room talking to coworkers along the way, and stopping at convenience stores.\n\n*The time saved could be used for an extra hour of sleep instead!*\n\n### 19. Reduced Type 2 Diabetes Risk\n\nWhile black coffee actually has beenshown to reduce diabetes risk, drinking sugary coffee and caffeinated beverages actually increase your risk of diabetes.\n\n> “*People who consume sugary drinks regularly—1 to 2 cans a day or more—have a 26% greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes*” –Harvard School of Public Health6\n\n### 20. Better Health\n\nMany research studies point to thehealth benefits of coffee and tea because of their antioxidant properties. However, this isn’t true for all caffeinated beverages.\n\nSoda, energy drinks, and processed coffee and tea products most likely have a negative impact on your long-term health.\n\nPeople who drink mainly water report more natural energy,better overall feelings of wellness, better sleep, and healthier skin.\n\n## Should You Quit?\n\nIf you are a slave to your coffee mug or energy drink, then you already know the answer. The real question becomes, how am I going to quit without failing my day-to-day responsibilities?\n\nIf that’s the case, then consider a product we endorse calledWean Caffeine to help you detox without withdrawal symptoms.\n\nWean Caffeine allows you to gradually cut down on caffeine systematically so that you can take back control of your natural energy levels while not losing control of your life.\n\n**Have you reaped any of the above benefits from giving up caffeine?**', 0, '2021-03-11 17:24:27', '2021-03-11 17:24:25', '/resources/images/10218535933_4599e2a93f_o-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/benefits-quitting-caffeine.html', 0, 0);

around 400mg of caffeine per person per day!\n- South American countries, such as Argentina and Brazil get most of their caffeine fromMaté.\n- The Brits are big tea drinkers (no surprises there).\n- The US? Just 168mg of caffeine per person per day (mostly coffee). I wonder how this has changed asenergy drinks have proliferated. Do coffee drinkers consume energy drinks as well?\n\nYou can read more about this research in Pharmacological Reviews, Vol. 51, Issue 1, 83-133, March 1999 “Actions of Caffeine in the Brain with Special Reference to Factors That Contribute to Its Widespread Use” link).', 0, '2021-03-11 17:24:29', '2021-03-11 17:24:30', '/resources/images/espresso-overdose-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/caffeine-what-the-world-drinks.html', 0, 0);

We look into the science behind this strange phenomenon.', '![aroma-of-coffee](/resources/images/aroma-of-coffee.jpg)\n\nDo you start waking up at just the smell of coffee?**\n\nYou aren’t alone and there’s even research to prove it.\n\nI would argue that one of the best smells in the whole wide world is fresh ground coffee.\n\nI mean fresh here. Not two-month old supermarket beans. Not Freeze-dried instant. But coffee beans that have been ground up a few hours earlier.\n\nThe smell of coffee (or rather lack of it) is one a number of reasons forStarbucks faced decline a few years ago.\n\n**According to the CEO:**\n\n> *He noticed how the smell of the company’s breakfast sandwiches overpowered the aroma of coffee and new flavors had replaced genuine inspiration.*\n\n## The Coffee Aroma Research\n\nAs for that smell –new research has shown that just the SMELL of coffee is enough to wake up a bunch of sleep-deprived rats.\n\n> *We don’t know if the same genes are suppressed in sleep-deprived humans, nor whether we would feel tired if they were, but many of these genes do have human equivalents.

They suggest pumping them into factories to help revive tired workers who can’t sip coffee while operating machinery.\n\n### Coffee Has a Very Complex Scent\n\nResearchers have so far identified 800 compounds in coffee and many of these are powerfully tied to scent.\n\n![coffee aroma](/resources/images/coffe-art.jpg)\n\nCoffee is rich inheterocyclic compounds, which influence the flavor and smell of a substance.\n\nHumans tend to love these smells since they hit many scent receptors. This helps people form powerful connections to items with these scents including coffee.\n\n### The Smell of Coffee Elicits Good Feelings\n\nSmells can trigger good feelings, memories, and even trauma, so it is no wonder that the smell of coffee triggers feelings of wakefulness.\n\nCoffee drinkers smell the coffee and this signals the brain that caffeine is indeed on the way, which provides stimulation.\n\nIn fact, I believe that the smell of coffee is actually much better than its taste. I drink mine black or with a little almond milk and bitterness is not one of the most appealing flavors to humans.\n\nIn any event, the smell of coffee and the drinking of it is something few would ever give up as the smell and taste are deeply tied to our brain’s pleasure center.\n\nThis one of the reasons responsible forour addiction to caffeine.\n\n**Do you think the best part of coffee is it aroma?**', 0, '2021-03-11 17:26:03', '2021-03-11 17:26:05', '/resources/images/aroma-of-coffee-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/just-smell-the-coffee.html', 0, 0);

Most research shows thatcoffee can be part of a diet that’s designed to prevent, treat, and/or possibly reverse type 2 diabetes.\n\n## Type 2 Diabetes and Coffee Research Studies\n\n1. A study published by the American Diabetes Association showed that those who drink coffee have lower sugar and insulin levels. It also appears that regular coffee is better than decaffeinated, so coffee could even prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes.15 overweight but otherwise healthy men were given either decaf coffee, a placebo, or the chemicals chlorogenic acid and trigonelline dissolved in water, which are two of the main antioxidants in coffee. The participants’ glucose and insulin levels were checked after consumption of each throughout the trial period. The only sample that showed lowered sugar and insulin levels was the chlorogenic acid and trigonelline solution group.Src.\n2. Another study analyzed much the latest research concerning diabetes and coffee consumption and was conducted by Harvard’s Dr. Frank Hu. His team found that the risk of type II diabetes decreased by 9% for each daily cup of coffee consumed. Decaf coffee decreased risk by 6% per cup.Src.\n3. An 11 year study looked at the diabetes and coffee risk association in postmenopausal women. They found that women who consumed 6 cups of coffee had a 22% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Src.\n4. An 18 year Swedish study also showed a greater degree of decreased risk among women who consume the most cups of coffee daily. *The Swedes are one of the highest coffee consumers in the world.*Src.\n5. “Nineteen of 22 epidemiological studies concluded that long-term consumption of coffee, both caffeinated and decaffeinated, can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, but several investigators have warned that the caffeine in caffeinated coffee can impair glucose metabolism” fromDiabetes Journals.\n6. The newer study is from the Harvard School of Public Health and it showed that type 2 diabetes risk decreases with every cup of coffee consumed. People who increased their coffee consumption by one cup saw an 11% decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. However, those that decreased their coffee consumption by one cup saw a 17% increase in risk.Src.\n7. Yet another study out of Denmark showed that coffee consumption doesn’t increase type 2 diabetes risk nor obesity risk for even the staunchest of coffee drinkers. 93,000 people’s coffee habits were analyzed for the study and there was no association between coffee consumption obesity, and diabetes.The study.\n\n### Decaf Coffee Not as Helpful\n\nAlthough, caffeinated coffee does seem to offer the most protection, it isn’t likely due to the caffeine. Coffee is actuallyrich in antioxidants.\n\n![coffee-and-diabetes](/resources/images/coffee-and-diabetes.jpg)\n\nIn the decaffeination process these antioxidants are also removed to much lower concentrations along with the caffeine.\n\nThis explains why the same results weren’t observed with thedecaf samples. Therefore, it does seem to be best to have regular, full-test coffee that’s been un-messed around with if you want to experience less type 2 diabetes risk or help in treating this form of diabetes.\n\n## Caffeine Lowers Blood Glucose Levels During Exercise\n\nResearchers found that when people with type 2 diabetes use caffeine prior to exercise it lowers their blood glucose levels more.\n\nStudy participants given 1 mg of caffeine per 1 kg of body weight had on average a 75 mg/dL increased drop in blood sugar compared with those who did not have the caffeine.\n\n**Good or Bad?**\n\nGood if you are trying to naturally lower your blood sugar with diet and exercise.\n\nBad if you are on insulin and in danger of your blood sugar dropping too low.\n\n### The Bottom Line?\n\nThis is good news for coffee drinkers or those that would be at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. You can drink all the coffee you want, but we would advise that you learn to drink it black to experience the full benefits. Also be sure to not go beyond establisheddaily caffeine safe levels.\n\nAdding sugar and creamer no doubt quickly reduces some of coffee’s type 2 diabetes protective benefits.\n\n*If you have diabetes always consult your physician before making any changes to your diet.*', 0, '2021-03-11 17:27:57', '2021-03-11 17:27:58', '/resources/images/coffee-caffeine-diabetes-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/coffee-and-diabetes.html', 0, 0);

At only a few state testing sites, including some of Maryland\'s drive-through testing sites, a provider\'s order is not required, and patients do not have to have symptoms.\n\nTo get a coronavirus test at other facilities, including all University of Maryland Medical System facilities, a doctor\'s order is required. Find an UMMS coronavirus testing location.\n\nCall your doctor BEFORE going to the doctor\'s office, ER or urgent care center, to let them know your symptoms.\n\n### What to Do If:\n\n**You don\'t have a primary care doctor. **You can contact your city or county health department for advice, or call the UMMS Nurse Call Line, a free 24/7 phone service to answer questions from the community about coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\n\n**You have mild symptoms.** Coronavirus can be treated at home.

Don\'t waste time trying to get a test. Call 911 or go to the nearest hospital ER or urgent care center.\n\n## Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Testing\n\nIt is possible to transmit coronavirus even if you are not symptomatic, so everyone should take precautions to avoid spreading the virus. However, it is most contagious when people have symptoms.\n\n\"Symptomatic persons have more virus in their respiratory tract than those who are not symptomatic. Also, their coughing and sneezing releases droplets in the air around them, on surfaces and on their hands, which makes them more contagious than someone with no symptoms,\" says Gregory M. Schrank, MD, an infectious disease specialist who is co-chair of the COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Committee for the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) and the University of Maryland, Baltimore..\n\nIn the early stages of infection, before symptoms appear, it is possible the virus will not be detected by a test, according to the CDC, so a negative test might provide a false sense of security.\n\n### If You Are Well, but Worried\n\nIf you don\'t have symptoms, but are worried about getting sick, the best advice is to follow guidelines for social distancing], wash your hands often for a full 20 seconds with soap and water, use hand sanitizer when soap and water are not available, and avoid touching your face. Those precautions will help you avoid getting sick more than a test would, says Dr. Schrank.\n\n\"Also remember that about 80 percent of cases are mild and people will recover on their own,\" he says.\n\nPeople who are at higher risk – those age 70 or older, or with diabetes, heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) – should monitor their health closely and contact their primary care practitioners with any concerns, Dr. Schrank says.\n\n## Drive-Up Coronavirus Testing\n\nDrive-up sites continue to be a good model for testing those with a doctor\'s order, Dr. Shrank says. It limits the risk of transmission to and from other patients (compared to being inside a crowded medical office and emergency room) and keeps health care providers safer while still allowing them to swab the patient\'s nose or throat for a sample, take vital signs and observe patients for potential signs of serious illness.\n\n\"It\'s very understandable to have anxiety and stress about coronavirus,\" Dr. Schrank says. \"But if you\'re worried at all, remember the best way to prevent infection of any kind is with frequent hand-washing, use of hand sanitizer and social distancing.\"', 0, '2021-03-16 17:47:16', '2021-03-16 17:47:18', '/resources/images/virus550.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/diagnosis-symptoms/test', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (102, 7, 'About Masks and Coronavirus', '', 'The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now recommends that everyone wear a mask when in public during the coronavirus pandemic. The CDC recommends using a cloth mask that can be created from cheap materials or household items, such as a T-shirt.\n\nGoing forward, the most important way you can protect yourself from the virus, as well as others, is to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you. However, it is important to continue wearing a mask and practicing social distancing, even after you have been vaccinated.\n\nMedical-grade masks, such as surgical or N-95 masks, need to be reserved for those who need them most and should only be worn by healthcare workers or first responders. Learn more about the type of mask that is right for you.\n\nWearing a homemade mask is particularly important in places where maintaining a distance of 6 feet or more from other people is difficult, such as the grocery store or pharmacies.\n\nIt is also one of the many reasons why the University of Maryland Medical System\'s visitor restrictions require every person entering a hospital or physician practice to wear a face mask at all times.\n\n## What Face Covers Do\n\nNovel coronavirus infects others through droplets. These droplets can be projected into the air when someone speaks, coughs or sneezes. Risk of coronavirus transmission through these droplets is higher when people are in close proximity to one another.\n\nCloth masks contain those droplets and keep them from projecting into the air, reducing the likelihood of transmission. This is particularly important when normal social distancing measures are difficult to follow, such as getting groceries or medications at a pharmacy.\n\nMasks mainly keep you from unknowingly spreading the disease to others, but some studies indicate that they may help protect you from large droplets and serve as an indirect reminder to avoid touching your face.\n\nHomemade masks are not a replacement for social distancing measures. You should still do everything you can to prevent coronavirus infection, including avoiding close contact with other people and washing your hands frequently.\n\n## Why Wear a Cloth Mask?\n\nFace masks are necessary to protect others from novel coronavirus.\n\nSome people who have coronavirus are asymptomatic, meaning they have no symptoms. Some with the virus have no symptoms but will go on to develop coronavirus symptoms; they are considered pre-symptomatic. Studies have shown that asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people are potentially contagious and can unknowingly infect others\n\nIn light of this information, the CDC has recommended wearing a face mask to reduce transmission and keep people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic from infecting others.\n\n## Who Should Wear a Homemade Mask?\n\nWearing a homemade mask is voluntary, but the CDC recommends that most people should wear them. There are some exceptions to this recommendation.\n\nThe following people should not wear them:\n\n- Children under two years old\n- People with breathing problems\n- People who can\'t remove the mask without assistance, such as those who are incapacitated or disabled\n\n## Coronavirus Mask Usage and Care\n\nEffective coronavirus masks will fit snugly against the face when worn. When removing them, it is important to avoid touching your face – especially your eyes, nose and mouth. Wash your hands immediately after removing the mask.\n\nMasks should be cleaned after every wear. This frequency will vary depending on how often you need to wear the mask. The CDC recommends using a machine washer and dryer for proper cleaning. Read more about cleaning for coronavirus.\n\n## Make Your Own Mask\n\nThere are many ways to make a cloth mask at home. Not all of these methods require a sewing machine.\n\nHomemade masks must meet these basic requirements:\n\n- Fit snugly but comfortably against the sides of the face\n- Be secured with ties or ear loops\n- Have multiple layers of fabric\n- Allow for unrestricted breathing\n- Able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or shape changes\n\nTo see approved ways to make a face cover, visit the CDC website.', 0, '2021-03-16 17:51:19', '2021-03-16 17:51:21', '/resources/images/coronavirus-tips-facemask.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/masks', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (103, 7, 'How Coronavirus Spreads', '', '![Illustration of coronavirus on a molecular level](/resources/images/coronavirus-spread.jpg)\n\nUnderstanding how coronavirus spreads is an important part of protecting yourself. Coronavirus transmission can happen in a variety of ways.\n\nLearn more about how COVID spreads and what you can do to protect yourself. Going forward, though, the most important way you can protect yourself from the virus as well as others is to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you.\n\n## How Does the Coronavirus Spread?\n\nThough novel coronavirus is still very new, we are learning more about the different ways it can spread. There are three primary modes of transmission.\n\n### Respiratory Droplets\n\nRespiratory droplets that contain the virus are the primary vehicle for coronavirus spread, according to the CDC.\n\nRespiratory droplets are created by infectious people when they cough, sneeze, sing, shout, talk or even just breathe. If a nearby person inhales these droplets, they can become infected.\n\nIf these droplets land on nearby surfaces, they can also become contaminated.\n\n#### Avoiding Respiratory Transmission\n\n- Social distancing and avoiding people you don\'t live with as much as possible is the best way to prevent coronavirus spread.\n- Remaining at least 6 feet apart from others can also significantly reduce your chances of inhaling respiratory droplets.\n- Wearing a mask can also help contain the respiratory droplets you exhale as well as creating a barrier between you and an infected person\'s respiratory droplets.\n\n### Contact Transmission\n\nAnother main way coronavirus spreads is by directly touching a person who is infected. You can also get coronavirus by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your mouth, nose or another membrane, which would allow it to enter the body.\n\n#### Avoiding Contact Transmission\n\nBe sure to:\n\n- Diligently wash your hands\n- Properly clean high-touch surfaces\n- Avoid touching your face\n\n### Airborne Virus Transmission\n\nIn October, the CDC officially recognized that coronavirus could spread through airborne transmission. Airborne transmission is when respiratory droplets containing the virus remain suspended in the air for a longer amount of time (hours rather than minutes or seconds). Droplets that remain airborne can also travel over distances greater than 6 feet.\n\n#### Avoiding Airborne Transmission\n\nThere are certain situations that you should avoid to decrease your risk of being infected through airborne transmission:\n\n- **Crowded spaces.** Spaces with lots of people and poor ventilation can put you at risk.\n- **Inadequate ventilation. **Being in closed-off spaces with little ventilation or air movement allows suspended respiratory droplets to build up in the air. If an infectious person is or has recently been in the space, airborne transmission could occur.\n- **Taking part in activities that generate excessive respiratory droplets. **In addition to the above, certain actions produce more and smaller respiratory droplets than others, increasing the likelihood of airborne transmission in enclosed spaces. These activities include shouting, singing and exercising.\n\n## Is the Coronavirus Airborne?\n\nThough we have long known about the coronavirus\'s ability to spread through respiratory droplets, many have also wondered if the coronavirus is airborne.\n\nAfter analyzing the evidence currently available, the CDC determined that it\'s possible for the coronavirus to spread through the air. The difference between airborne and droplet transmission may seem like a technicality, but there are distinct ramifications.\n\nRespiratory droplets aren\'t all the same. They can be large, even visible to the naked eye. This means that they fall to the ground quickly and are less likely to be inhaled by another person.\n\nIn airborne transmission, these droplets are very small, meaning that they are lighter and can remain in the air for extended periods of time. Small droplets can also travel greater distances, moving with air currents. This means that, in certain cases, 6 feet of distance may not be enough to protect yourself.\n\nIn a health care setting, taking measures to stop transmission is essential for keeping patients safe. All University of Maryland Medical System hospitals have been isolating patients with or suspected of having coronavirus since the beginning of the pandemic. This practice, which began as a precautionary measure as we learned more about the virus, has since become an important part of keeping our patients safe when they need to go to the hospital.\n\n## Does Weather Affect Coronavirus Spread?\n\nWhile the virus is new and studies are still being conducted, as of November 2020, the relationship between weather and coronavirus spread still isn\'t fully understood. What we do know is that coronavirus spread can still happen in any kind of weather.\n\n**If so, why is there concern about the virus becoming worse in the winter?**\n\nOther respiratory viruses, like the common cold or flu, spread more in the winter months. Some believe that viruses can live longer in colder temperatures and lower humidity, but this is still a topic of study and is not currently considered the main contributor to respiratory virus seasonality.\n\nInstead, the main factor seems to be human behavior. When the weather gets cold, we retreat indoors — often with other people in poorly ventilated spaces. This allows highly infectious viruses to spread from person-to-person with ease.\n\nThis means that items like humidifiers, while useful for relieving respiratory illness symptoms, will likely have no significant impact on the potential for coronavirus spread this winter. The best way to protect yourself is by using CDC-recommended coronavirus prevention measures.', 0, '2021-03-16 17:52:41', '2021-03-16 17:52:39', '/resources/images/coronavirus-spread.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/prevention-safety/coronavirus-spread', 0, 0);

For instance, it can last up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to a few days on plastics and stainless steel.\n\n## How to Disinfect For Coronavirus\n\nLearn what kinds of cleaning you need to do right now to help you and your family stay well.\n\n### Cleaning Surfaces in Your Home\n\nYou want to go beyond a light cleaning. You should use household cleaning products to disinfect high-touch areas in your home, like:\n\n- Countertops\n- Rails\n- Tables\n- Backs of chairs\n- Light switches\n- Faucets\n- Toilets\n- Refrigerator doors\n- Doorknobs\n- Remote controls\n\nIf it is touched throughout the day, clean it! Once a day may not be enough because no one is sure yet how long these germs can live on specific surfaces. You should sanitize these areas several times each day.\n\nAlso, a quick swipe of a damp paper towel is not enough to kill the germs. Tables and countertops, for example, need to be visibly wet for several minutes. Check the side of the cleaner as it usually states a suggested time that the surface needs to be wet to make the maximum impact.\n\n### Cleaning Your Phone\n\nCoronavirus germs can live on our phones, which is why we need to be cleaning them now more than ever.\n\nFor anyone with an iPhone, Apple recommends using a 70 percent isopropyl alcohol wipe or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes to gently wipe the exterior surfaces of your iPhone. Do not use bleach. Samsung has not commented on whether wipes are a good way to clean your phone.\n\nAnd don\'t forget the phone case. This can also be cleaned with a disinfecting wipe.\n\n### Cleaning Computers\n\nComputers and other electronic devices are a high-touch surfaces. They should be cleaned often, particularly if multiple people use the same one.\n\nUse a solution of 70 percent isopropyl alcohol and 30 water, as recommended by the CDC. Many household cleaners and disinfectants have bleach, peroxides, acetone or ammonia, which may cause permanent damage to the product.\n\nTurn off the device before cleaning and clean all surfaces that hands may touch.\n\n### Sanitizing Laundry\n\nIf you are caring for someone with coronavirus or you are going out the grocery store or other public places, you may need to take extra care with your laundry.\n\n- Immediately remove and wash clothes or bedding that have blood, stool or body fluids on them.\n- Wear disposable gloves while handling soiled items and keep soiled items away from your body.\n- Clean your hands (with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer) immediately after removing your gloves.\n- Read and follow directions on labels of laundry or clothing items and detergent. In general, using a normal laundry detergent according to washing machine instructions and dry thoroughly using the warmest temperatures recommended on the clothing label.\n\n## Approved Cleaning Products for Coronavirus\n\nBleach, ammonia and hydrogen peroxide are all good examples of products that can disinfect.\n\nApproved disinfectants against coronavirus include:\n\n- Clorox Multi Surface Cleaner + Bleach\n- Clorox Disinfecting Wipes\n- Clorox Commercial Solutions\n- Clorox Disinfecting Spray\n- Lysol Heavy-Duty Cleaner Disinfectant Concentrate\n- Lysol Disinfectant Max Cover Mist\n- Lysol Clean & Fresh Multi-Surface Cleaner\n- Purell Professional Surface Disinfectant Wipes\n- Sani-Prime Germicidal Spray\n\n### Other Cleaning Products\n\nVinegar and vodka probably won\'t do the necessary job, though there has been recent discussion about these two products for cleaning.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, use a household cleaner liberally and often in your home to help disinfect and sanitize your home, ridding it of germs.\n\n**Safety Note: **Mixing cleaning products can be very toxic.

We brush the hair from our eyes, scratch our noses, rest our chins in our hands multiple times throughout the day, not to mention taking glasses on and off, rubbing our foreheads and most recently, putting on and taking off our face masks.\n\nPay attention to how many times you touch your face in just an hour. According to a recent research study, participants touched their faces an average of 23 times per hour. Of those touches, 44 percent came in contact with mucous membranes.\n\n## How the Virus Is Transmitted\n\nExperts believe that the coronavirus is most commonly spread by droplets that are sneezed or coughed out and are then inhaled by someone else.\n\nThose droplets can land on surfaces, and when you touch that surface and then touch your mouth, nose or eyes, the virus can enter your body.\n\nThat is part of the reason it is so important to wash your hands. But in between washes, you are still at risk for getting the virus.\n\n## How to Stop Touching Your Face\n\nFortunately, the same study also found that by making the participants aware of how often they touched their faces and teaching them how it has the potential to spread illness, they were less likely to touch their faces.\n\nWe also came up with some ways that may help you touch your face less often:\n\n- ### Be aware.\n\n\n- Pay attention to how often you touch your face. This can include watching other people. Noticing how often they do it can bring awareness to you.\n\n\n- ### Change the way you sit.\n\n\n- Avoid putting your elbows on the tabletop because this often leads to resting your chin in your hands. You can even try sitting on your hands or folding them in your lap to keep them away from your face.\n\n\n- ### Keep your hands busy.\n\n\n- Try using a fidget spinner, knitting or crochet, rubber band or stress ball to keep your hands occupied.\n\n\n- ### Tie or pin back hair.\n\n\n- If your hair is causing you to touch your face, fix it in a new way so you don’t have to keep pushing it out of your eyes.\n\n\n- ### Make sure your glasses fit properly.\n\n\n- They should not slide down your face. If you need to push them up or take them off, handle them from sides, not the bridge or other parts that touch your face.\n\n\n- ### Use a tissue.\n\n\n- If you have an itch or have to touch your face for any reason, hold a clean tissue in your hand as you do it.\n\n\n- ### Prevent itchiness.\n\n\n- Use moisturizer to prevent dry, itchy skin. Use eye drops if your eyes are dry and itchy. (Make sure to wash your hands before and after using the eye drops.) Treat seasonal allergies to prevent itchy noses.\n\n\n- ### Wear a scent.\n\n\n- Apply a light perfume or lotion on your hands or wrists that you can smell every time you bring your hands to your face.\n\n\n- ### Imagine your hands are dirty.\n\n\n- You can\'t see the germs on your hand, so pretend that your hands are covered in something visible, like paint or mud. This is more useful in short-term situations like when shopping at the grocery store.\n\n\n- ### Wear a mask.\n\n\n- A face mask can act as a reminder** **to not touch your face. However, it\'s important to note that, if wearing a mask makes you fidget or you find yourself constantly adjusting it, this is not a good technique for you. You are still required to wear a face mask when going into certain public places, such as retail establishments and riding on public transportation.\n\nEven if you are excellent at not touching your face, you still need to wash your hands or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer frequently, especially if you go out in public. Since touching your face is a habit, there will still be times you fall back into old ways. Do your best, but keep washing those hands!', 0, '2021-03-16 17:58:08', '2021-03-16 17:58:10', '/resources/images/touch-face.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/prevention-safety/protect/not-touch-face', 0, 0);

These people may be contagious and spreading the disease even if they are only mildly sick.\n\n## Questions to Consider\n\nMany illnesses, like seasonal allergies, the common cold and seasonal flu, exhibit similar symptoms. To determine if the cause could be the coronavirus, you should also ask yourself the following questions:\n\n**Did you have close contact with a diagnosed COVID-19 patient? **Close contact means that you spent time within 6 feet of the person (see how the CDC defines close contact) or have come into direct contact with their saliva through coughing or sneezing.\n\n**Have you visited an area that has high community transmission of COVID 19? **If you have traveled, consider if you visited a city, state or country with COVID-19 spread.\n\n**Are you at a higher risk for coronavirus?** Based on the evidence we have so far, older adults and people with chronic diseases are most susceptible to serious complications from the virus.\n\n## Next Steps If You Have Coronavirus Symptoms\n\nIf you have developed these symptoms, here are a few next steps you can take based on your symptoms and health history.\n\n### If you are experiencing mild symptoms:\n\n- Do not leave your home. Do not go to the hospital or call 911 unless it is an emergency. Learn more about when to go to the hospital.\n- Call your healthcare provider for more information.

INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (109, 7, 'Coronavirus Immunity', '', '![Watercolor illustration of virus and globe](/resources/images/coronavirus-immunity.jpg)\n\nMany people hope that coronavirus immunity can bring them back to \"normal life\" and that those who recovered from coronavirus do not need to be concerned about being infected or infecting others.\n\nUnfortunately, there are too many unknowns about immunity to novel coronavirus to be sure.\n\nLearn what we currently know about coronavirus immunity, why we haven\'t relied on coronavirus herd immunity to end the pandemic and what antibody testing can tell you.\n\n------\n\n**COVID Vaccine: **The most important way you can protect yourself from the virus as well as others is to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it is available to you.\n\n------\n\n## Can You Get Coronavirus Twice?\n\nThere is currently no conclusive evidence that points to how long coronavirus immunity lasts. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there here have been a few recorded cases of coronavirus reinfection, but they remain rare.\n\nScientists are still studying the duration of coronavirus immunity and how likely a person is to get COVID-19 twice. Because of these unknowns, the CDC recommends always adhering to coronavirus prevention measures, even if you\'ve been infected before.\n\n## How Viruses Work\n\nTo understand coronavirus immunity, it is important to know how viruses work and how the immune system responds to them.\n\nViruses are pieces of genetic material surrounded by a protein coating. They can\'t reproduce without finding \"host cells.\" This is why they seek out cells like the ones in our bodies.\n\nWhen viruses enter our bodies, they find a cell and inject it with their genetic material. This allows them to take control of the cell and multiply.\n\nTo battle this, the body\'s immune system must destroy infected cells. When the body first encounters a new viral infection, it deploys T cells, which find and kill infected cells. If the infection continues, the body then deploys B cells, which create antibodies that can better attack infected cells.\n\nEven after the infection has passed, antibodies remain in the body to help the body fight off future infection. How long these antibodies last in the body varies, ranging from days to a lifetime.\n\n## Understanding COVID Immunity\n\nThere are still many unknowns when it comes to coronavirus immunity. At this time, there is currently no way to know how long any immunity could last.\n\nOther types of coronaviruses, such as MERS, do induce immunity, often for several years. Many hope that SARS-CoV-2 will behave similarly.\n\nUnfortunately, the data is not cut-and-dry. Most studies of immunity to coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, focus on people who had severe disease and were hospitalized for their condition. There is significantly less data on the immune response in people who had mild symptoms or were asymptomatic.\n\nAll of these unknowns are why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization currently state that there is no evidence to suggest novel coronavirus infection imparts immunity. More research needs to done.\n\n## Coronavirus Herd Immunity\n\nThere are multiple reasons why we can\'t lean on herd immunity to help slow the spread of coronavirus.\n\nHerd immunity is when most of a population is immune to an infectious disease, thus providing indirect protection to people who aren\'t immune to the disease.\n\nVaccines are the best tactic for creating herd immunity. Even if the majority of the population has had an infectious disease, if there is no vaccine, the disease can still be transmitted among children who haven\'t yet been exposed to the virus and people who are immunocompromised.\n\nAt this point in time, there are several reasons why herd immunity cannot help stem the pandemic in the United States. Instead, we must rely on other prevention measures.\n\nAccording to a report by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, current data suggests that around 70 percent of the population would need to be immune to achieve herd immunity to coronavirus.\n\nEvidence suggests that infection rates are much lower. Reaching the levels of infection needed to achieve herd immunity without a vaccine could be devastating, potentially overwhelming health care systems and leading to an extraordinary number of deaths.\n\n## Coronavirus Antibody Tests\n\nCoronavirus antibody tests identify specific antibodies in a person\'s blood that indicate they have been infected with the virus. Antibody tests are different than the tests used to detect an active coronavirus infection.\n\nAntibody Tests and Coronavirus Immunity\n\nAntibody tests do not tell you whether you are immune to coronavirus. They simply indicate if you have or haven\'t been infected with the virus. If you have been infected, it doesn\'t necessarily mean you are immune.\n\nA positive antibody test isn\'t an \"immunity passport.\" It does not mean that you can stop practicing the prevention measures that keep you and others safe, such as:\n\n- Social distancing\n- Washing your hands\n- Avoiding touching your face\n- Wearing a mask\n\n### What a Coronavirus Antibody Test Can Tell You\n\nIf coronavirus antibody tests can\'t tell you if you\'re immune to the virus, then what can they do?\n\nAntibody tests give you a better understanding of how you have personally been affected by the virus. It can also put you in a position to participate in plasma donation to help treat others.\n\nAntibody tests are also being used to help determine how widespread coronavirus infection is in certain communities. This can be beneficial for creating public policy and better understanding how to keep communities safe.', 0, '2021-03-16 18:04:09', '2021-03-16 18:04:11', '/resources/images/coronavirus-immunity.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/covid-vaccine/facts/immunity', 0, 0);

It looks like a magical dust that transforms into an even coat of paint. But it\'s completely different from nail polish. A regular manicure can chip immediately after you leave the salon, but most dip-powder manicures claim to last up to three weeks longer than gel manicures. So when my nail tech asked if I wanted to try it out, I was down. But I found out that it isn\'t a new technique at all, dip powder has actually been around since the ‘80s.\r\n\r\nThe name dip powder basically explains the process. First, a base coat is applied, and the nail is dipped into a powder. The process is repeated a couple of times depending on how many coats you want. Then, the rough, powdery layers are transformed into a smooth, glossy finish once a sealant is applied. The best part: You don\'t have to worry about the possibility of skin damage from UV lamps. Unlike the classic gel manicure, it dries instantly. And the powders don\'t pose any inhalation threats, according to chemist Doug Schoon, president of Schoon Scientific + Regulatory Consulting and co-chair of Nail Manufacturer’s Council. That\'s why it\'s being marketed with words like \"safe,\" \"natural,\" and \"organic.\" However those claims aren\'t regulated, and choosing the powders over gel manis isn\'t necessarily a better choice.\r\n\r\nRelated: If You Get Gel Manicures, This Is What You Need To Know About UV Lamps And Skin Cancer\r\n\r\nIn fact, gel manicures, dip powders, and traditional nail extensions have more in common than you think. They are all made up of an acrylic base. \"All of the ingredients used to make any type of artificial nail—whether they be glued, cured by UV, or mixed with a liquid and powder—are based on the acrylic family,\" Schoon says.\r\n\r\nSo, how do dip powders differ from acrylic nails and gel manicures? The grains are finer, which allows them to be created in more vibrant colors. Dip powders are bonded using a glue called cyanoacrylate, which is also the main ingredient in Krazy Glue. \"Acrylic nails\", on the other hand, are applied by combining a liquid with a powder to form a gel. Similarly, the ingredients in gel manicures are like pre-mixed acrylics, and they undergo a chemical reaction once they are cured with a UV lamp.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRelated: What Your Nails Can Tell You About Your Health\r\n\r\nSo, in theory they are all the same. But that doesn\'t mean that they are all bad for your nails. Schoon says that you could wear acrylics for years without harming your nails. You\'ll only see problems if the application, maintenance, or removal techniques are done incorrectly. That\'s why it\'s important to find a salon that doesn\'t rush during the removal process. The dip-powder manicures soak off just like gel manis but can take longer. \"One thing that people don’t understand is that if it says soak for fifteen minutes to remove, that’s the minimum time,\" Schoon says. And the longer you leave the acrylics on, the longer it will take to soak them off. \"It may be fifteen minutes if you take them off the same day, but if you wait two weeks or four weeks, it could take thirty minutes.\" The last thing you want to do is scrape off layers of your nails, so it\'s worth it to be patient. And there is no such thing as gently scraping. \"That\'s like saying I punched you gently in the nose,\" Schoon says.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to reserve dip powder and other acrylic-based manicures for special occasions. \"This may be great as a one time use when you want stronger nails,\" says celebrity nail stylist Elle. The acrylics will create a hard surface on your nails while you\'re wearing them. So, find a technician that won\'t rush through any steps, and one that can talk to you about how to properly take care of your nails in between appointments.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:12:14', '2021-05-28 19:12:17', '/resources/images/wps6.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/dip-powder-nail-polish-manicures', 0, 0);

But, she recently revealed, those manis come at a price. Rushmore-Perrin told the Daily Mail that she’s been getting acrylics for six years. She says she has them done professionally and usually has them removed by professionals, but she recently didn’t have time to visit the salon and decided to DIY. “One nail had come off, and I didn’t want to have nine nails on, so I started peeling and snapping them off,” she said. “I then soaked the remains off in acetone.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that didn’t end well. Rushmore-Perrin posted a photo on Twitter of her torn, cracked, and bleeding nails after she removed her acrylic manicure herself. In another tweet, she said the pain was excruciating. “Nearly cried in the shower at the hot water touching my nail beds and I\'m pretty sure there\'s still loads of shampoo left in my hair,\" she replied to the tweet. “Don’t even care how they look, it’s the physical PAIN dear lord.”\r\n\r\nRushmore-Perrin posted another photo of her much healthier-looking nails less than a week afterward. “Five days later, after taking two different kinds of biotin every day,” she captioned the photo. “Still not amazing or beautiful, but LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, biotin is necessary for the formation of fatty acids and glucose, which fuel the body. Biotin is also a B vitamin that helps provide the necessary building blocks for healthy hair and nail production, Joshua Zeichner, M.D., a New York City-based board-certified dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Rushmore-Perrin\'s case, doctors doubt biotin helped repair her nails. Your nails are only really alive at the base, Doris Day, M.D., a clinical associate professor of dermatology at the New York University Langone Medical Center, tells SELF. By the time nails grow beyond the cuticle, they’re just dead cells, similar to your hair. Therefore, any potential benefits from biotin supplements will be seen from the base on up, which is why Gary Goldenberg, M.D., medical director of the Dermatology Faculty Practice at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells SELF that although biotin is helpful in the development and growth of nails, it can take six to 12 months for people to see results. Day is skeptical Rushmore-Perrin\'s progress is due to the biotin, adding that the beauty blogger\'s nails likely got better because she stopped putting acrylics on and they had time to heal.\r\n\r\nAngelica Ross Gets a Buzz Cut, Talks Womanhood & Radical Blackness\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt\'s usually not necessary to take biotin for hair and nail benefits because it\'s rare for people to be deficient in biotin, Day says. That means people’s bodies typically make healthy hair and nails just fine without additional supplementation. If you do use a supplement, Zeichner says you won’t see any changes to hair and nails you already have. What you can expect, if your body is deficient in biotin, is new hair and nail growth that\'s potentially stronger and healthier than you\'re used to. Jill Waibel, M.D., founder and owner of The Miami Dermatology and Laser in Institute, tells SELF that biotin has been found to be especially helpful with brittle nails, which makes sense since that\'s a common sign of biotin deficiency.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to keep in mind: Supplements are unregulated and can definitely be dangerous or cause unpleasant side effects (many biotin-supplementing people complain of cystic acne online) if you take too many of them. Instead of popping a supplement, Goldenberg points out that it\'s better to get the vitamin from foods such as avocados, fish, and legumes.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re still intrigued, check in with your doctor or dermatologist—they\'ll be able to determine whether you have some sort of deficiency affecting your nails or hair, then be able to figure out an action plan from there.\r\n', 0, '2021-05-28 19:15:20', '2021-05-28 19:15:17', '/resources/images/wps7.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/biotin-nails-acrylics-repair', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (117, 14, 'What Is Dermaplaning and Should You Try It?', 'Here\'s what experts say you should know.', '![img](/resources/images/wps1-1622200668692.png) \r\n\r\nYou may have seen people on YouTube shaving their faces using small razors to exfoliate their skin or get rid of facial hair and wondered, “What is dermaplaning, and should I try it?”\r\n\r\nWhile those YouTube tutorials may make dermaplaning look like an easy “do it yourself” procedure, experts say you should avoid trying this at home for several reasons that we will explain. Plus, dermaplaning is not recommended for all skin types, so it’s best to consult with a dermatologist about whether it’s right for you. Below, dermatologists explain what you should know about dermaplaning, including the risks, benefits, and cost.\r\n\r\n***\\*What is dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nDermaplaning is a cosmetic procedure that involves scraping your face with a scalpel to remove the e pidermis—your top layer of skin—and small hairs, explains Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D., professor of dermatology, medicine, and nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Traditionally, people have the procedure done in a dermatologist’s office, however, you can find blades at the drugstore marketed for at-home dermaplaning use. That said, it’s safer for a professional to perform this. (We’ll get to all of that in a bit.) It’s also always a good idea to research any procedure you’re interested in, even if you delay the actual procedure itself because of the pandemic. (Here’s more information to help you navigate making medical appointments during COVID-19). \r\n\r\nDuring a dermaplaning session, the dermatologist uses a medical-grade scalpel to scrape across the surface of the skin. The treatment takes about 15 minutes, and it can cost anywhere from $40 to more than $150, depending on where you go.\r\n\r\n***\\*What are the benefits of dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nThe main reason people do it is to remove the vellus hairs on their faces, which some people refer to as peach fuzz. Everyone has these fine vellus hairs coating their bodies, and they serve a purpose: Vellus hairs keep us warm and add another layer of protection to the skin. But some people’s vellus hairs are thicker and more visible than others, and depending on how they feel about that, they might want to have it removed. Of course, dermaplaning is just one way to do that. There are many at-home hair removal kits that may get the job done, including the Glee Face Wax Hair Removal Strips for Women ($9, Walmart.com) that a SELF editor loves. However, dermatologist Rosemarie Ingleton, M.D., tells SELF that typical hair-removal methods like waxing and threading don’t always provide the results people are looking for, which makes dermaplaning an appealing option. You may have heard that shaving hair on your face makes hair grow back thicker—that’s technically not true. But it may look thicker or darker, thanks to having a blunter tip from shaving as it grows out, according to the Mayo Clinic.\r\n\r\nPeople might try laser hair removal for longer-lasting results, according to Jeanine Downie, M.D., a dermatologist in New Jersey. This method damages the hair follicles using heat, so your strands don’t grow back as easily. Although it is marketed as a permanent option, your hair may grow back after any hormonal changes (like menopause), according to the Cleveland Clinic. It also takes several sessions to see changes. The exact amount varies, and generally, people with dark skin need more sessions compared to people with light skin. This option also doesn’t work on gray hairs.\r\n\r\nDr. Ingleton says that the biggest reason she does dermaplaning in her practice is to remove vellus hairs, but that the blade also gets rid of a superficial layer of dead skin. This can make your skin look brighter, help your skin-care products sink in better, and make your foundation go on smoother. In Dr. Ingleton’s practice, dermaplaning is often an add-on done before other treatments like microdermabrasion or ablative lasers like Fraxel. When it comes to exfoliating, there are no studies showing how dermaplaning compares to other treatments like retinoids or chemical peels, says Dr. Kim. That’s one reason why Dr. Downie prefers to use peels over dermaplaning—even for sensitive skin—and doesn’t offer dermaplaning in her practice. “Peels help to improve texture, tone, acne, and fine lines,” she says. “They are not equivalent at all, and many peels give deeper exfoliation than a scalpel,” Dr. Downie says.\r\n\r\nIs it ok to try dermaplaning at home?\r\n\r\nWhile it might feel like getting rid of these hairs is easy to do at home with an inexpensive blade, professionals warn against it. Any blade you get over-the-counter won’t be as sharp—or as effective—as the medical-grade scalpel used at the office. Also, there’s always the chance you will cut yourself in the process, potentially causing scarring.\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nAnytime a sharp object goes near your face, there is a risk of damage to the skin. Dr. Downie says that she’s seen patients with scarring after a dermaplaning session gone wrong. Although some medical spas offer dermaplaning, Dr. Downie recommends seeing a professional board-certified dermatologist for this kind of procedure. Board certification is an extra certification step that shows a physician completed advanced training in their specialty. (You can find a board-certified specialist by visiting The American Academy of Dermatology website.)\r\n\r\n***\\*How often should you have dermaplaning done?\\****\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the hair away, you might have to get treated about once a month. (Of course, the exact timeline will look different for each person.) Dr. Kim says this is not a treatment you should do too frequently. Our epidermis helps protect us from allergens and other potential irritants in the outside world—dermaplaning too often may irritate or damage that top layer of protection, she says. Again, this is why it’s best to consult with a physician who can help you decide on the appropriate frequency for your skin and needs.\r\n\r\n***\\*When should you avoid dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nThere are a few instances where you should think twice before signing up for dermaplaning. If you have acne, there is a chance that the blade could nick a pimple, says Dr. Downie, which means it would take longer to heal. So if you have something like a serious cystic breakout happening, it might be best to postpone. Ideally, you want to consult with a doctor who has experience with acne-prone patients. Also, tell your dermatologist if you have a history of cold sores. “If you have a breakout of cold sores, you need to be on Valtrex, and the physician ne eds to avoid the area,” says Dr. Downie. Without the use of a preventive oral anti-herpes medication, the cold sores can spread due to microtears in the skin.\r\n\r\n***\\*Is there anything else to know about dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nAfter a dermaplaning treatment, you do need to take care of your skin. “You have to coat your skin with sunblock afterwards because you’re going to be more sensitive to the sun,” says Dr. Downie. “You also have to be cautious of retinol and glycolic acids.” Dermatologists recommend that people with sensitive skin use a light moisturizer like Vanicream ($36, Amazon) because it doesn’t contain fragrances or other irritants. If you do choose to try dermaplaning, just be sure to work with a professional dermatologist for the safest possible experience.\r\n\r\nAll products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (118, 14, 'How to Manage Retinization When Using Retinoids', 'The first month on retinoids can be brutal.', '![img](/resources/images/wps2.png)\r\n\r\nBeauty editors praise retinoids for being a skin-care ingredient that seemingly does it all. They’re powerful enough to decrease acne, pigmentation, and wrinkles. But first comes the retinization period, where you might experience reddened, peeling, and dry skin. During this time, your skin is adjusting to the medication, and let’s not mince words, it sucks.\r\n\r\nIf you previously tried retinoids but thought they weren’t for you because of the side effects, then we have some good news: You can try again if you want. “Almost everyone can use retinoids if you tailor it to yourself,” Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D, professor of Dermatology, Medicine, and Nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, tells SELF. The key is figuring out the right strength and how often you can use it, she says. Even most of her patients with rosacea or sensitive skin can generally use a mild retinoid sparingly, she explains.\r\n\r\nWe spoke to a few experts about what you should know about retinoids and tips to keep in mind.\r\n\r\n1. What are retinoids, and why should you use them?\r\n\r\nThere’s a good chance you’ve heard of “retinols,” and you might be wondering if they are different from retinoids. It’s easiest to think of retinoids as a family of compounds derived from vitamin A, explains Dr. Kim. Then, there are retinols, or a form of retinoids commonly found in over-the-counter skin care products, and retinoic acid, found in prescription medications. But again, these are all forms of vitamin A, which can help your skin cells turn over more quickly when applied topically.\r\n\r\n“It’s very confusing because people just call everything retinols, but there are differences,” says Dr. Kim. The most important thing for you to remember is that retinoic acid requires a prescription and retinols can be found in products at your drugstore. Retin-A, or tretinoin as it’s called generically, is one popular brand of prescription retinoic acid.\r\n\r\nRetinoids may reduce wrinkles because they activate your skin’s natural collagen and elastin (two fibers that keep it strong). They’re also good exfoliators since they force your skin cells to turn over more quickly, which helps reduce acne, says Dr. Kim. In six to eight weeks, retinoids can clear up and prevent acne, reduce the look of fine lines, and lighten hyperpigmentation until it disappears. But prescription retinoids are strong stuff, so your skin is likely to get sensitive and irritated as it gets used to their mechanisms of action. Over-the-counter retinols can cause light irritation, but it\'s less severe since they are formulated to be gentler than prescription options. Because retinols are weaker, you may not notice skin changes, e.g., less acne, for several months, Dr. Kim says.\r\n\r\n2. What is retinization?\r\n\r\nLike we said, retinization is that period where your skin is adjusting to the retinoids. Generally, your skin may feel irritated, dry, and begin peeling, explains Dr. Kim. It starts a few days after you first start applying the medication and can last about a month (give or take a couple weeks) while your skin builds up a tolerance. Even people with sensitive skin can generally use some form of retinoids, says Dr. Kim. However, they might need to try the following skin care strategies to help reduce irritation, especially if using a prescription retinoid. Or, people with sensitive skin may need to try over-the-counter retinols since these are less irritating. Dr. Kim likes Differin Gel ($16, Amazon.com) since it was previously available by prescription and has been well-tested. As with most health concerns, it is best to consult with a dermatologist who can help you develop a plan that works for your specific skin. Right now, many physicians are offering virtual appointments using video chat. (Here’s what you need to know about scheduling medical appointments during COVID-19).\r\n\r\n3. Prepare your skin before starting retinoids.\r\n\r\nThe best prep you can do for your new retinoid regimen is to make sure your face isn’t dehydrated. “Moisturized skin has a better barrier function,” meaning that it’s at peak protection for whatever you throw at it, Beverly Hills dermatologist and founder of SkinxFive Ava Shamban, M.D., tells SELF. She says that means starting on a solid moisturization routine—morning and night—at least a week or so before you begin using the medication.\r\n\r\n4. Apply moisturizer before your retinoid at night.\r\n\r\nLayering the retinoid over a gentle moisturizer will help temper any irritation. Look for a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, ceramides, antioxidants, or redness-relieving peptides. Finding the right moisturizer for your particular skin type isn’t always easy. You can read our guide on moisturizer if you need help finding a product you like. The CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Lotion ($18, Amazon.com) is one dermatologist-recommended pick that works well for combination skin, for instance.\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nNote: The skin around your eyes is extra sensitive, and you shouldn’t apply retinoids to the upper eyelids at the risk of getting product in your eye. Protect the entire eye area with a thick moisturizer before putting retinoids on the rest of your face.\r\n\r\n5. Don’t start by applying retinoids every day.\r\n\r\nRetinoids aren’t something you should apply every day from the start. You have to work your way up to regular use. “Start slowly applying twice per week and then gradually add another day until you have built up tolerance for daily use,” RealSelf dermatologist Michele Green, M.D., tells SELF. If your skin has an adverse reaction, such as excessive peeling, lay off the treatment for a couple days. Then, you can try again but decrease the amount of times you use it per week. For example, if you experienced irritation after using it four times in a week, then bump your frequency down to three and see how your skin reacts. Some people can only tolerate using retinoids about twice a week, explains Dr. Kim.\r\n\r\n6. Change to a simple skin-care routine.\r\n\r\nFor the first month of regular retinoid use, your skin is officially classified as “sensitive.” That means you need to change up your cleansing and exfoliating routine. “Using a gentle detergent cleanser will allow some natural oils to remain on the skin, reducing the likelihood of developing the irritant dermatitis,” says Dr. Shamban. She says to look for something that is cream-based like Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser ($10, Amazon.com).\r\n\r\nAlso give up your masks, peels, and exfoliating scrubs. “Retinol will naturally exfoliate the skin,” says Dr. Shamban. “There is no reason to do any kind of a manual dermabrasion or exfoliating.” Dr. Green adds that you should avoid applying any other skin-care products with retinol, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and glycolic acid as they can be too harsh on your skin during retinization.\r\n\r\n7. Treat dry patches with extra moisturizer.\r\n\r\nDry patches and peeling will likely happen when you use retinoids. Dr. Shamban recommends applying aloe gel or 1 percent hydrocortisone cream like CeraVe Anti-Itch Cream ($9, Amazon.com) during the day to help with flakiness and irritation.\r\n\r\n8. Be patient about your results.\r\n\r\n“In dermatology, people want to do something once and that’s it,” says Dr. Kim. However, she says that you need to be patient and play the long game when it comes to retinoids. “You want to use this for a long time to really see the benefit of what these can do for your skin,” she says. So if a prescription retinoid is irritating, then you may want to use a weaker retinol. Or your doctor may be able to prescribe you a lower-dose retinoid that your skin tolerates.\r\n\r\n9. Call your dermatologist if you’re in pain.\r\n\r\nYes, some redness and itchiness are expected, but if you have an extreme reaction, it needs professional attention. “If your face starts to look like a charred tomato, it’s time to back off and see a physician,” Dr. Shamban says. Dr. Green seconds this sentiment, “If the skin starts to crack and you have open lesions which are oozing, you should definitely stop using the product and see your dermatologist. Also, if you develop a rash, this could mean you are having an allergic reaction to the product.” Again, you may not feel comfortable with physical office visits right now. But your dermatologist may be able to provide care through a virtual session, so it’s worth calling their office to check.\r\n\r\nAdditional reporting by Melissa Matthews\r\n\r\nAll products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (119, 14, '10 Things to Know Before Trying Dermal Fillers', 'Read this before making your appointment.', '![img](/resources/images/wps3.png) \r\n\r\nOur bodies naturally change with age, and those differences might include new wrinkles on our faces or cheekbones that aren’t as high as they once were. Dermal fillers can help minimize these signs of aging if you’re unhappy with them.\r\n\r\nHowever, these changes are completely normal and occur when we lose some of the subcutaneous fat that supports our skin. Over time, the skin on the middle of our faces shifts down too, causing our cheeks to sag a bit, explains Mary Stevenson, M.D., dermatologist at NYU Langone Health. “Filler can be used to help lift and add support,” she tells SELF. It can also help soften wrinkles, Dr. Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nThere are several categories of dermal fillers, and they’re all generally administered in the same way (more on that in a bit). Before electing to have any type of cosmetic or medical procedure, it’s important to understand what the process entails and any potential risks. Understandably, you might also have concerns about visiting a doctor’s office during the pandemic. Our story about making medical appointments during COVID-19 can help you decide if now is the right time to schedule an elective procedure. But below, you’ll find information experts think you should know about dermal fillers\r\n\r\n1. What exactly are dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nFirst things first: Dermal fillers are not to be confused with Botox, injectable drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to smooth lines and wrinkles. The latter \"freezes\" muscles to reduce wrinkles, while dermal fillers are injectable implants approved by the FDA to help smooth skin and wrinkles. As the name implies, they are injected beneath your skin using a needle.\r\n\r\nAccording to the FDA, there are four categories of fillers. Each is named for the type of material they’re made with:\r\n\r\nHyaluronic acid is naturally produced by your body and already found in your skin and cartilage. Generally, fillers made with hyaluronic acid last between 6-12 months.\r\n\r\nCalcium hydroxylapatite is a mineral that is found in our bones. Fillers made with this material last up to 18 months.\r\n\r\nPoly-L-lactic acid is a biodegradable synthetic material that’s also used to make medical products like dissolvable stitches. These fillers may last up to two years.\r\n\r\nPolymethylmethacrylate beads are the only filler that can’t be absorbed by your body, meaning the results are permanent. They’re only used around the mouth.\r\n\r\nHyaluronic acid, which you may recognize as a common ingredient in some skincare products, is one of the most popular types of fillers, explains Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D, professor of dermatology, medicine, and nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Because it helps skin retain moisture, hyaluronic acid can make your face look more plump and hydrated. It\'s also used in lotions as a moisturizer, but no cream can restore lost volume—only injectable hyaluronic acid can do that. Juvéderm and Restylane are two popular name brand hyaluronic fillers that you may have heard of.\r\n\r\n2. How do I know which dermal filler to try?\r\n\r\nA good doctor will explain the ideal treatment plan for you, but know that the most natural-looking results may require more than one type of filler. There are many different brands of fillers within each category, and the products vary in how they should be used—like filling out cheeks—and concentration of the active ingredient, explains Dr. Kim. For example, Restylane, one brand of hyaluronic filler, has five different lines—and each is used for different reasons. \"Restylane Lyft has larger particle sizes—think of them like the bricks of a foundation,\" Whitney Bowe, M.D. a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, tells SELF. Those larger particles have the heft to \"rebuild\" thinned cheekbones, while a smaller particle size, as in Restylane Silk, works better for addressing fine lines and plumping lips.\r\n\r\n3. Why do people get dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nDr. Kim explains that patients come to her saying “they just want to look a little better,” without turning to cosmetic surgery. She uses dermal fillers to add in volume and smooth out wrinkles, which her patients are normally happy with, she says.\r\n\r\nWATCH\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nDermal fillers are particularly popular because patients see differences in their appearances before leaving her office, Dr. Kim says. Generally, people notice the desired changes from other non-surgical procedures, like Botox, after a few days.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note: Dermal fillers are not FDA-approved for body contouring procedures. In other words, they shouldn’t be used to increase the size of your breasts or butt.\r\n\r\n4. What precautions should I take before getting fillers?\r\n\r\nIt probably goes without saying, but safety should be your top priority when considering any medical procedure. Dr. Kim says visiting a board-certified dermatologist or a board-certified plastic surgeon is one way to ensure that your physician is experienced. This extra certification step shows that the doctor completed additional training in their particular specialty. (You can find a board-certified specialist by visiting The American Board of Plastic Surgery or the American Academy of Dermatology websites.) Even though dermal fillers are available at medical spas, you should see only licensed and trained physicians for any injectable treatment. There are risks for issues like infection, discoloration, and lumps if injections are done incorrectly.\r\n\r\nGiven that this is a cosmetic procedure, you understandably want to be satisfied with the results. One way to find a doctor whose work you like is by asking friends who have had this done for their recommendations. \"People are starting to be more open about injectables,\" Ava Shamban, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist in Los Angeles, tells SELF.\r\n\r\n5. What should I ask my doctor during the consultation?\r\n\r\n“I think as a patient you should always ask for a consultation first and then really talk about what your goal is and how they [the doctor] can help you,” says Dr. Kim. You may think you just want dermal fillers, but an expert could recommend another treatment—or a combination of treatments—based on your specific skin type and goals. For example, your doctor may suggest using laser therapy if you have a lot of pigmentation, she says.\r\n\r\nDr. Shamban advises requesting before-and-after photographs of real patients from the doctor’s office. Every practitioner has different philosophies, techniques, and levels of experience. And don\'t be afraid to ask about your doctor’s training and certification during the initial consultation.\r\n\r\nLastly, you and your physician should communicate about realistic results and your expectations—it\'s your face, after all.\r\n\r\n6. What are the possible side effects of fillers?\r\n\r\nEven non-surgical procedures have their risks. The most common side effects include bruising, redness, pain, or swelling, all of which should go away within two weeks, according to the FDA. Less frequently, people might get raised bumps under their skin that need to be treated with injections, medications, or even surgically removed, according to the FDA.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is rare, filler can accidentally be injected into a blood vessel and lead to blurred vision or permanent blindness. You should call your doctor or the emergency room if your skin turns blue and you’re in a lot of pain—these are two possible signs that filler is in your bloodstream. Again, this is why you want to see an experienced doctor who is skilled in performing the procedure.\r\n\r\n7. Who should avoid dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nAccording to the FDA, there’s no research showing that dermal fillers are safe for pregnant or breastfeeding people, so you may want to hold off if you’re expecting a baby or recently had a child. And here\'s one more thing to consider: Avoid getting filler right before a teeth cleaning or other dental treatment, Dr. Shamban says. These procedures require pressure and stretching of the face that could potentially misplace fillers. You can ask your doctor for their opinion regarding when it’s safe to get any future dental work during your consultation.\r\n\r\n8. How much do dermal fillers cost?\r\n\r\nIf the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. If you see a deal for inexpensive filler, be skeptical. \"You have to be careful,\" Dr. Shamban says, adding that counterfeit and diluted filler do exist. \"Ask to see the box, and look for a safety seal on it.\" The price of these fillers varies depending on the amount of product needed. In 2019, the average cost of hyaluronic acid fillers was $652 per syringe, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. They estimate that most patients need more than one syringe to achieve the results they’re looking for.\r\n\r\n9. Are dermal fillers permanent?\r\n\r\nIf you\'re unhappy with the way filler looks, don\'t panic—in most cases, you can have it adjusted. A dermatologist might inject additional filler for balance, or they can dissolve it altogether, depending on the type. \"The wonderful thing about hyaluronic acid fillers is that there\'s an enzyme that can be injected into the area to dissolve the product,\" Dr. Shamban says. \"It just goes away.\"\r\n\r\nBut when expertly injected, filler should look natural. \"The changes we can make are so subtle that nobody would notice,\" says Dr. Shamban. \r\n\r\n10. How long will the results last?\r\n\r\nSince the majority of fillers aren’t permanent, you\'ll have to keep going back to the doctor’s office if you love the results following your procedure. After about six months, your body naturally breaks down hyaluronic acid fillers. So, you have to get touch-ups once or twice a year to maintain the look. However, this is good news if you just want to try fillers once or twice, since the effects will fade away without any long-term risks.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:19:50', '2021-05-28 19:19:51', '/resources/images/wps3.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/dermal-fillers', 1, 0);

I thought I’d discovered all my skin-care favorites—until I tried Supergoop!

Play, which is suitable for both face and body. Typically I’m wary of two-in-one skin products (I don’t fully endorse the idea of body wash that also works for your face, for example). But I was willing to give this a shot because I love Supergoop!—and it didn’t disappoint.\r\n\r\nI totally get why this is called Everyday Lotion, since its consistency is just as creamy and lightweight as some of my favorite moisturizers.

It’s nongreasy with a pleasantly mild scent, and my skin drinks this stuff up with little effort. Supergoop! Play\'s chameleon-like ability to work on both my face and body without triggering breakouts is truly a game changer, and I no longer have to bother switching between a bunch of sun-protection products on the regular. \r\n\r\nSince Supergoop! Play offers broad-spectrum SPF 50 protection, plus has a water- and sweat-resistant formula, I don’t worry about it wearing off during outdoor workouts. I can happily wear it in the ocean and actually feel good about it, as it is now officially a reef-safe sunscreen, meaning it doesn’t contain chemical UV filters like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are known to be harmful to coral reefs and other sea life. \r\n\r\nNow that I’ve added this new gold star to my list of skin-care go-tos, I’m ready to graduate from the handheld 2.4-ounce size right to the jumbo, easy-to-pump 18-ounce version.

Then, after a quick shot of her face with numbing cream, Mitchell takes a moment to show the camera her “little melasma spot” just below her eye and points to a patch of melasma on her upper lip. “Especially for new moms,” she says. “We go out in the sun and this is what happens.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Mitchell says she was too nervous to take video during the actual treatment, immediately after it she reports that her face is numb and that the IPL felt like “a million little elastic bands hitting all over.” She also points out a few red areas on her face that the treatment had targeted. Her facial treatment continues with a soothing collagen mask.\r\n\r\nThen, Mitchell cuts to an update from a week after her first treatment. She seems happy with the results so far. Although she says it’s recommended to get another one or two treatments, after the first one she feels that “we’re on track to lightening these little guys up.”\r\n\r\nMelasma is a form of hyperpigmentation that frequently shows up during or after pregnancy. The condition is so frequently associated with pregnancy that it’s sometimes even called the mask of pregnancy, SELF explained previously. It usually causes patches of brown or grayish-brown skin on the cheeks, forehead, nose, upper lip, and chin. Those patches aren’t harmful or painful, and sometimes, they’ll fade away on their own. But some people may want to have them lightened or removed.\r\n\r\nFirst off, as Mitchell points out, melasma is exacerbated by UV exposure, so wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 is usually a mainstay of melasma treatment and maintenance. Plus, recent research suggests that those with melasma may benefit from using a sunscreen containing iron oxides, which help block visible light from the sun and devices, like your phone or laptop.\r\n\r\nFrom there, treatment usually involves topical medications, such as prescription hydroquinone, which can lighten skin, the American Academy of Dermatology explains. Tretinoin, a powerful retinoid that speeds up the cell turnover process, is another common choice, as are corticosteroid medications and azelaic acid. \r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nBut topical medications aren’t always enough, which is where treatments like the one Mitchell received come in. For more stubborn melasma, a dermatologist might recommend in-office procedures like microdermabrasion, chemical peels, or laser treatments. The specific treatment Mitchell got—IPL—is similar to laser treatments but involves the use of multiple light wavelengths to treat certain issues. It’s especially useful in managing hyperpigmentation, broken blood vessels sometimes seen in rosacea, and age spots.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that nonablative treatments like this stimulate the growth of new collagen by heating up the skin, SELF explained previously. However, for most skin conditions, multiple treatments are required for you to see noticeable results. Mitchell specifically mentions in her video that she’s hoping her melasma spots will look lighter after three sessions.\r\n\r\nAfter treatment, it’s normal for the skin to be a little red, swollen, and sensitive for a few hours or a few days, Baylor College of Medicine explains. But generally you should be able to resume your normal activities without any downtime.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:20:33', '2021-05-28 19:20:35', '/resources/images/wps6.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/shay-mitchell-melasma-ipl', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (122, 14, 'Here’s Why You Get Sun Spots on Your Face—And How to Treat Them', 'They’re usually harmless.', '![img](/resources/images/wps8.png) \r\n\r\nIf you’ve spent any time in the sun throughout your life, you may have developed some sun spots on your face. These spots (also called age spots, liver spots, or solar lentigines) appear as flat, smooth brown spots on areas of your skin that tend to get a lot of sun exposure.\r\n\r\nSun spots are generally harmless areas of pigmented skin, but they can be easily confused with other types of sun-related spots on the skin, including some that may actually be a sign of skin cancer. If you think you have sun spots on your face, it’s important to monitor them and to get anything that looks iffy checked out by a board-certified dermatologist.\r\n\r\nHere’s what you need to know about sun spots, how to prevent them, how dermatologists can treat or remove them, and signs to look for that may signal an issue.\r\n\r\nWhat causes sun spots on your face?\r\n\r\nSun spots on your face are a type of hyperpigmentation caused by UV exposure. Essentially, after being exposed to the sun, your skin increases production of melanin, the pigment that gives skin color. Over time, some areas of your skin may develop clumps of melanin or may overproduce that pigment, resulting in a sun spot, the Mayo Clinic explains.\r\n\r\nThese types of spots tend to show up on areas of your body where you get the most sun, which might include your face, shoulders, hands, chest, and the back of your hands, Mary L. Stevenson, M.D., assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. Sun spots tend to be flat rather than raised, are usually brown, and may appear in clusters.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to prevent sun spots?\r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent sun spots on your face is to develop and maintain solid sun safety habits. “They can be prevented with diligent sun protection including use of sunscreen on regular basis, and other forms of sun protection like hats, sun glasses, and clothing,” Nada Elbuluk, M.D., clinical assistant professor of dermatology (clinician educator), Keck School of Medicine of USC, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nThat includes using broad spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) every day, particularly on areas of your body that are prone to sun exposure, like your face, your shoulders, and the back of your hands. Sun spots are more likely to show up on people with lighter skin, Elbuluk says, but people with darker skin tones can still develop sun-related skin damage, so it’s important for everyone to wear sunscreen regularly.\r\n\r\nBut we know that it’s a bit difficult to stick to diligent sunscreen wearing (and reapplication) habits—and even perfect sunscreen usage doesn’t protect you from 100% of the sun’s rays. That’s why it’s crucial to also use other sun protection strategies, like wearing sun-protective clothing, sticking to the shade whenever possible, and wearing hats and sunglasses that block the sun.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nEltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 ($38, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nNeutrogena Ultra-Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreen SPF 30 ($10, Amazon)\r\n\r\nLa Roche Posay Anthelios Mineral Sunscreen Gentle Lotion SPF 50 ($22, Amazon)\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to treat sun spots?\r\n\r\nTrue sun spots are not harmful and don\'t need to be treated. If you do decide you want to have your sun spots treated or removed for cosmetic reasons, this is something you’ll likely have to see a professional about. Although you can certainly try some products containing the classic brightening ingredients, like hydroquinone, retinoids, or vitamin C, “over-the-counter products are typically not strong enough to have a significant effect on sun spots,” Elbuluk explains.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nAlthough some of those products can be helpful in preventing sun spots and generally evening out your skin tone, they aren’t likely to be enough once you have the spots, Stevenson says. So if you want to have a sun spot removed, you’ll need to talk to a board-certified dermatologist. They may recommend using a prescription-strength lightening cream or procedures such as professional chemical peels or laser treatments, Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nAfter a laser treatment, the spot will usually “turn a little white, crust, and then peel off,” Stevenson explains, so that you’re left with a subtly pink area that eventually fades. After doing all that work to have the spot removed, it’s really important to keep it from getting any more sun, she says, especially while it’s still healing, because laser treatments can make your skin more sensitive to sun exposure. In fact, Stevenson says she generally doesn’t treat sun spots during the summer because of this risk for more pigmentation after treatment. \r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes other types of spots (called seborrheic keratoses) are confused with sun spots, Stevenson says. Seborrheic keratoses, like sun spots, are harmless brown, tan, or black growths on the skin, the Mayo Clinic explains. However, unlike true sun spots, these marks tend to be slightly raised, which means they may need to be shaved down or destroyed with electrocautery. These procedures may then be combined with laser treatments to further remove the pigment. Many people who are prone to sun spots are also prone to seborrheic keratoses, so it’s common to have both Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nHyperpigmentation on the face might also be melasma, a condition that tends to appear in patches on the cheeks, forehead, nose, or chin, SELF explained previously.\r\n\r\nWhen should you talk to a dermatologist?\r\n\r\nAlthough true sun spots aren’t harmful, they are a result of sun damage and therefore can be a sign that you need to get better at protecting yourself from sun exposure.\r\n\r\nSometimes, cancerous spots on your skin can look like sun spots or seborrheic keratoses, the Mayo Clinic says. So if you have a lot of sun spots or you notice one that looks suspicious or odd, it’s always a good idea to get checked out by a dermatologist. \r\n\r\nIn particular, it’s important to take note of any spots that seem to be growing or changing rapidly. “If [you have] a brown spot that seems to be changing in size, color, or appearance, then it may not be a sun spot and should be examined by a board-certified dermatologist to rule out skin cancer,” Elbuluk says.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:20:57', '2021-05-28 19:20:59', '/resources/images/wps8.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/sun-spots-on-face', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (123, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Spider Veins and Varicose Veins', 'This isn’t a DIY situation.', '![img](/resources/images/wps9.png)\r\n\r\nIf you’re wondering how to get rid of spider veins, you’ve probably already come across a bunch of the internet’s suggestions. When I noticed a series of faint blue lines twisting around my thigh, some of the recommended home remedies I saw included ginger tea, massage, and even exercise. But here’s the honest truth: That’s all B.S. Visible veins aren’t something you can fix at home.\r\n\r\nSo I talked to dermatologists and surgeons who specialize in treating spider veins and varicose veins (the larger, raised visible veins that often appear on the legs). What I learned is that the underlying causes of these visible veins aren’t always preventable—and they can be a sign of a much deeper vein problem that no home remedy is likely to fix. Here’s how to get rid of spider veins for real—and why it’s so important to see a specialist to do so.\r\n\r\nWhat actually are spider veins?\r\n\r\nThere are two common types of visible veins: spider veins and varicose veins. “Spider veins are really small superficial veins that are in the outer layer of skin between the dermis and epidermis, so you can see them,” Christopher Hollingsworth, M.D., a general surgeon at NYC Surgical Associates, tells SELF. “If you live long enough, most people are going to get them.” These veins get their name because they look like thin, weblike, blue-and-purple lines on the legs.\r\n\r\nVaricose veins, on the other hand, are larger veins that are deeper in the body. “You won’t see them as a discoloration, you’ll see them when they get so stretched out that they kind of bulge,” Dr. Hollingsworth says.\r\n\r\nBecause these two issues are caused by similar blood-flow situations, varicose and spider veins commonly occur together. That means that people who have varicose veins almost always have spider veins too. However, some people get spider veins and never have a problem with varicose veins.\r\n\r\nWhat causes spider veins and other visible veins?\r\n\r\nTo understand why these visible veins develop, you’ve got to understand how blood flows through the body. Your heart pumps blood to your entire body through your blood vessels. From there, blood circulates outward toward the extremities (legs, arms, head) through the arteries and back inward to the heart through your veins.\r\n\r\n“Think of veins as being a hose that flows from bottom-up toward your heart,” says dermatologist Alicia Barba, M.D., of Barba Dermatology. “And there’s a little valve. When they work well, the blood shoots up and the valve closes. When it doesn’t work, the blood falls back down instead of moving north.”\r\n\r\nWhen blood flows in the wrong direction because of a valve problem, it can get backed up in the veins of the legs, which damages the walls of the vein, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) explains. That extra pressure on the vein walls gradually causes them to weaken and then bulge, creating veins we can actually see. In fact, the majority of people who have spider veins and/or varicose veins will be dealing with this type of “venous insufficiency,” Dr. Hollingsworth says.\r\n\r\nHowever, other factors can contribute to the likelihood that you’ll develop visible veins, including genetics, age, and your level of physical activity, the AAD says.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you have a job where you are standing still for long periods of time, gravity is at work pulling the blood back down toward the legs, causing the veins to get stretched out and the valves to weaken over time. If you sit all day at your job, you can also start to see visible veins because there is a lack of muscle movement. The muscles in the leg help the veins push the blood back up toward the heart, so moving around during the day can help prevent visible veins. (That rumor that crossing your legs can cause spider veins isn’t true, so go ahead and cross ’em if you like—just make sure that you get out of your chair and move around during the day to get the blood pumping.)\r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nThere is some research to suggest that carrying extra weight can impact the function of your veins and, therefore, also increase your risk for visible veins. Having more fat around your stomach (visceral fat) can increase the pressure in your abdomen, Dr. Hollingsworth says, which then creates an obstruction that blocks the flow of blood. “That increased pressure dilates the veins, which extends all the way through the lower vein bridge and all the way up to the veins in your skin,” he explains.\r\n\r\nA similar situation happens during pregnancy when the added pressure in the abdomen squeezes the veins. But the hormonal shifts that happen during pregnancy may also play a role. “When women are exposed to excess estrogen or progesterone, what it tends to do is make your soft tissue a little more flexible,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. “That same process, we think, is affecting the veins, making them predisposed to dilate and stretch out.” After pregnancy, the veins generally go away and everything returns to normal. This vein weakening can also happen if you’re taking hormonal birth control.\r\n\r\nAlthough visible veins may seem like a purely superficial issue, they can become painful when left untreated. “Spider and varicose veins make your legs sore because it’s an inflammatory process,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. “Those veins are getting dilated and stretched out. They’re trying to signal for help in the only way they know how, which is sending off a local inflammatory biochemical that causes your legs to swell and to be sore.” So preventing and treating spider veins can save you from a lot of discomfort.\r\n\r\nCan you do anything to prevent spider veins?\r\n\r\nThere are a few different underlying causes of vein issues that are preventable or reversible, while others aren\'t. For instance, if your visible veins are largely due to inherited factors, pregnancy, or how active you can be during the work day, that’s not likely something you have a ton of control over.\r\n\r\nBut there are some general things you can do to prevent them, such as maintaining physical activity during the day. If you sit at work all day, the AAD recommends getting up and walking around a bit every 30 minutes. Or, if you stand at work for long periods of time, the AAD recommends taking a break and sitting down every 30 minutes. And exercising in general, elevating your legs when possible, and avoiding soaking for long periods of time in hot baths can help prevent visible veins as well, the AAD says.\r\n\r\nHowever, these strategies can’t treat any visible veins you already have.\r\n\r\nYou’ll need to see a specialist to actually treat visible veins.\r\n\r\nIf you’re wondering how to get rid of spider veins for good, know that Dr. Hollingsworth says those wacky home remedies won’t work. Dry brushing? Nope. Fancy body lotions? Nah. Massage? It might feel good, but there won’t be a visible difference.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing really that you can do aside from the small minimally invasive treatments we have that is going to make spider veins look any better,” he says. “Creams, ointments, or rubbing aren’t going to make spider veins go away.”\r\n\r\nThe primary way that spider and varicose veins are treated is by using different surgical methods to close off the vein so that it collapses and the residual scar tissue stops the blood flow completely. These are all superficial veins, so other healthy veins just take over their circulation duties and the procedure won’t impact your overall health. Also, those with more serious, bulging varicose veins can have them removed completely once the vein is closed off.\r\n\r\nSclerotherapy: This is one of the more popular options for spider veins and varicose veins. A doctor injects a foamy detergent or concentrated saltwater solution into the problematic vein, which irritates the walls of the blood vessel, explains Neil Sadick, M.D., founder of Sadick Dermatology. This causes scar tissue to form, which leads the blood vessel to close. If someone is allergic to the sclerotherapy solution, there are other treatment options.\r\n\r\nLaser treatment: A vein surgeon or dermatologist might use a laser treatment to heat the vein, causing it to contract and scar over. Dr Hollingsworth uses a handheld Nd:YAG laser (the same machine that can be used in laser hair removal) on small spider veins. Or, if it’s a larger varicose vein, a laser may be inserted into the vein using a catheter to stop blood flow.\r\n\r\nMedical glue: For varicose veins, doctors might also use is the medical version of superglue. “Cyanoacrylate glue is a biologic glue that’s very similar to Krazy Glue,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. Surgeons close off a varicose vein by gluing it shut from the inside. “You inject it, wait for the glue to set, and move further down, and so on and so on.”\r\n\r\nRadio frequency ablation (RFA): This is another option for varicose veins that are so large that glue and sclero just float away. “RFA runs radio frequency through the inside of the vein and turns the inside of the vein into a lightbulb filament, heats it up, scars it, and kills it,” says Dr. Hollingsworth.\r\n\r\nTo prevent visible veins from getting worse, a surgeon might use RFA or internal laser techniques to close off a larger vein deeper in the leg that feeds the smaller varicose veins and spider veins. “There’s a central pipe in the leg called the saphenous vein; it’s the main superficial vein. Coming off those veins are truncal varicose veins,” Dr. Sadick says. Once the larger vein is taken care of, the smaller veins can be treated with sclerotherapy, glue, or a handheld laser.\r\n\r\nAll of these treatments are performed through tiny punctures in the skin, so you can likely schedule your procedure in the morning and go back to work in the afternoon. However, Dr. Barba warns about getting these treatments on darker skin tones, especially laser and RFA procedures, because those with darker skin tones have a higher risk for hyperpigmentation issues following the treatments. Plus, those pigmentation issues can be stubborn to treat. “Sometimes the pigmentation is a part of the healing process,” Dr. Barba says. “If you care about a little spider vein, you might care about the pigment that’s going to be there for a couple months.”\r\n\r\nWhatever treatment you go with, the key is to go to a doctor who specializes in vein treatments, whether that’s a dermatologist or a vein surgeon. “If you want have anything done, go to whoever does a lot of it,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. The good news is that insurance will cover many vein treatments. Without insurance, these treatments can cost $300 to $8,000. “Oftentimes, when it is a deeper vein problem, insurance covers it because it\'s not [just] a cosmetic issue,” Dr. Barba says.\r\n\r\nHow can you prevent spider veins from coming back?\r\n\r\nAlthough effective, all of these surgical treatments are really temporary fixes, Dr. Hollingsworth says. Spider and varicose veins can return in other nearby veins once the original veins are closed off or removed. So, if you decide not to treat them at all, they can multiply, Dr. Hollingsworth says. But if you stay on top of them—which will require repeated treatments every one to two years—you can keep them at bay.\r\n\r\nAfter treatment, one thing you can do to effectively prevent spider veins from returning is to wear compression stockings daily, which can be difficult to get on and uncomfortable to wear. \"Nobody likes wearing them,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. But, “if you wear stockings religiously during the day, they significantly reduce [the chance that] your spider veins [will come] back.” In some cases, your health insurance may actually cover the cost of medical-grade compression stockings, Medline Plus explains, so check with them before buying any.\r\n\r\nUltimately, if you’re dealing with spider veins or varicose veins, it’s important to check in with a doctor or dermatologist. They can help you understand how serious your particular issue is, talk about what may underlying issues may have caused it, and, if necessary, walk you through your treatment options.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:21:21', '2021-05-28 19:21:23', '/resources/images/wps9.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/spider-and-varicose-veins', 0, 0);

You’re probably not imagining it. Not only is it becoming offensively hot and humid this summer, but we’re also wearing masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19—both of which may contribute to acne and other skin issues.\r\n\r\nBreakouts, in particular, have become so common that mask acne has been dubbed “maskne” on the internet. While you can’t ditch the mask, there are steps you can take to prevent and treat mask-related acne to enjoy a safe summer with healthy skin.\r\n\r\nWhat causes mask acne?\r\n\r\nAcne usually develops when pores get clogged by oil, dead skin cells, makeup, dirt, or bacteria. This can lead to blackheads, whiteheads, or pimples that can vary in size and type, depending on how infected they get.\r\n\r\nAdopting a simple skin-care routine—including cleansing, exfoliating, moisturizing, and wearing sunscreen—helps manage acne because it helps with the skin’s natural shedding process. Regular cleansing and exfoliating ensures that all that gunk and dead skin cells are removed rather than clogging your pores. Moisturizing and wearing sunscreen helps ensure the skin’s protective outer layer functions properly.\r\n\r\nBut wearing a face mask can interfere with that process. Instead of those dead skin cells shedding “throughout the day, they now get clogged in your pores,” Carrie L. Kovarik, M.D., an associate professor of dermatology at University of Pennsylvania and a member of the American Association of Dermatology’s (AAD) COVID-19 task force, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nMasks also provide the perfect humid environment for bacteria to grow in our skin, which can lead to a breakout, Noelani Gonzalez, M.D., director of cosmetic dermatology at Mount Sinai, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nHow can you treat mask acne?\r\n\r\nIf you’re dealing with an active mask acne breakout there are ways to treat it—and the methods aren’t so different from the way you’d treat regular acne.\r\n\r\nFor milder cases, classic over-the-counter acne-fighting ingredients like benzoyl peroxide (which kills the bacteria associated with acne) and salicylic acid (a chemical exfoliant that helps unclog pores, should be your go-tos, Dr. Gonzalez says. You can try using a benzoyl peroxide-containing spot treatment, such as Neutrogena On-the-Spot Acne Treatment ($6, Amazon) or La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Acne Treatment ($30, Amazon). And for salicylic acid products, look for gentle acne cleansers, such as Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser ($11, Ulta) or First Aid Beauty Acne Clearing Charcoal Cleanser ($24, Dermstore).\r\n\r\nBut for more severe acne, meaning it’s inflamed or you’re dealing with deep, cystic pimples, a dermatologist might prescribe other treatments such as anti-inflammatory cortisone creams or retinoid medications, which speed up the skin’s natural cell turnover process.\r\n\r\nHowever, both prescription and over-the-counter acne remedies can be irritating, especially if you have sensitive skin or you’re also dealing with raw, red, inflamed areas of skin. In these cases, a dermatologist may recommend you use acne treatments less frequently or hold off on treating the acne altogether until the raw areas of your skin heals. So the right treatment for you may depend on the exact type of problem you develop and your skin type.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve tried over-the-counter options without success, then it’s best to check in with a board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Gonzalez says. Many dermatologists are now offering video consultations as well.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to prevent mask acne?\r\n\r\nSince we’re going to be wearing masks for a while, managing mask acne isn’t going to be a one-time deal. It will require developing both treatment and ongoing prevention habits to keep your skin clear. And, because mask-related acne doesn’t just affect those who tend to be more acne-prone in general, dermatologists recommend that everyone practice good mask-wearing hygiene.\r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nThe first step is to choose a mask that allows your skin (and you) to breathe while also protecting others and yourself from the spread of coronavirus. To accomplish that, the mask should sit snugly but comfortably on your face and should cover both your mouth and nose, SELF explained previously.\r\n\r\n“I recommend soft fabrics, something like cotton or silk,” Dr. Gonzalez says. “They are materials that tend to be more gentle and breathable on the skin, versus synthetic materials that tend to be harsher on the skin.” Here are a few cloth masks to check out as well as recommendations for those looking to work out in a mask.\r\n\r\nAfter choosing a well-fitting mask that doesn’t irritate your skin, it’s time to think about what you put under it. Choosing skin care and makeup products that are labeled non-comedogenic or oil-free underneath the mask can help reduce chances of breakouts. But Dr. Gonzalez suggests avoiding makeup under your mask entirely—especially heavy foundations and multiple layers of products, which can clog pores and lead to acne.\r\n\r\nInstead, wear a moisturizer with at least SPF 30, Dr. Gonzalez says. Not only will this protect your skin from UV rays, but wearing sunscreen can also help prevent other mask-related skin issues, such as tan lines. And the moisturizing helps reduce friction and chafing.\r\n\r\nAfter a long day of wearing your mask, use a gentle cleanser to wash your face to remove all the accumulated debris and oil, Dr. Kovarik says. But dry skin is another common face mask-related skin issue, so make sure to moisturize immediately after washing your face. Kovarik recommends using a moisturizer with ceramides, which help lock moisture into your skin, and/or hyaluronic acid, which has a hydrating effect.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re thinking about adding anything new to your daily skin-care routine, Dr. Gonzalez recommends against starting any new harsh treatments for your skin. Adding products like harsh chemical peels can make the skin more sensitive “and should be avoided because that’ll make your skin more prone to breaking out,” she says.\r\n\r\nHow to wash your mask:\r\n\r\nYour face isn’t the only thing you need to wash! In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend washing cloth masks after each use, which helps remove oils and dead skin that collect inside the mask. To do so, use warm water and a gentle detergent that doesn’t irritate the skin.\r\n\r\nLook for detergents that are free of added colors and fragrances, which are common skin irritants, Dr. Kovarik says. This will ensure that you’re being gentle on sensitive or irritated skin and will reduce the chances of developing a reaction like contact dermatitis.\r\n\r\nAcne isn’t the only mask-related skin issue you might experience.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other skin issues that may arise during the summer of face masks. For instance, you may need to take extra care with your lips to prevent irritation. Unless you have a cone-shaped mask, “the lips are going to be the first thing your mask is going to touch,” Dr. Kovarik says. She recommends using a lip balm or Vaseline ($9 for a pack of 3, Amazon) to protect them.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you have a skin condition like rosacea or eczema, the irritation from face masks may trigger your symptoms. To manage that, definitely keep up the treatment plan that your dermatologist recommended for you, but get in touch with your derm if that plan is no longer enough to manage the flares.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:21:39', '2021-05-28 19:21:37', '/resources/images/wps10.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/mask-acne', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (125, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Back Acne for Good', 'And when to talk to a dermatologist.', '![img](/resources/images/wps11.png) \r\n\r\nFace acne is a common—and frustrating—skin condition to manage. And figuring out how to get rid of back acne is no different. For some people, back acne causes small pimples, while others deal with large cystic acne zits, which can be deep, painful, and pus-filled. And because back acne can be caused by external factors, particularly working out and wearing sweaty clothes, it can be stubborn to treat with the usual acne remedies—even if they work for the pimples on your face.\r\n\r\nSo what actually is back acne? And how can you treat it effectively? Here’s what you need to know about how to get rid of back acne for good.\r\n\r\nWhat causes back acne?\r\n\r\n“Acne is caused by increased oil production, bacteria, pore blockage, and irregular skin cell turnover,” board-certified dermatologist Eric Meinhardt, M.D., tells SELF, and that goes for your face and your back. Sebaceous glands in the skin produce oil, which can collect along with dead skin cells in the pores, plugging them up and giving bacteria a perfect breeding ground, all of which can lead to redness, whiteheads, blackheads, and sometimes infection.\r\n\r\nHormones can play a large role, which is why you might break out more around your period, for instance. And if you’ve noticed that your breakouts pop up in similar places as it does for other family members, that could signal that your acne has a hereditary component, Dr. Meinhardt says.\r\n\r\nWhile the root causes of zits are basically the same in both places, the skin on your face is very different from the skin on your back, which has its upsides and downsides. The skin on the face has more blood supply, Dr. Meinhardt says, which helps acne heal faster and reduces scarring. But the skin on the back is much thicker than the skin on the face (specifically the second layer, called the dermis). That means that the back is more resilient and can handle stronger treatments, scrubs, and exfoliants that would be considered too harsh for the face.\r\n\r\nHowever, not everything that looks like acne on your back is actually acne. For instance, so-called fungal acne tends to appear on the back and chest area and forms uniform red bumps. But traditional acne treatments won’t help manage it at all. So if you’re not sure what your issue really is, get checked out by a professional.\r\n\r\nHow can you treat—and prevent—back acne?\r\n\r\nTreating back acne can be a challenge, but there are some straightforward steps you can take at home that will help manage it, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). Here’s how to get rid of back acne for good:\r\n\r\nLook for benzoyl peroxide. Of all the over-the-counter acne medication options you have, the AAD suggests starting with benzoyl peroxide. This ingredient works by killing bacteria that fuel acne. The AAD recommends using a wash containing benzoyl peroxide by letting it sit on your skin for two to five minutes in the shower daily and then rinsing it off. They also suggest starting with a concentration of 5.3% and only going higher than that if a lower concentration isn’t enough. Although the skin on your back isn’t as sensitive as the skin on your face, high concentrations of benzoyl peroxide can cause side effects, so it’s still smart to start at a lower level and work your way up only if needed.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nPaula’s Choice Clear Extra Strength Daily Skin Clearing Treatment, $19, Amazon\r\n\r\nSLMD BP Body Wash, $35, Target\r\n\r\nPanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash 10%, $11, Target\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nTry a retinoid. Retinoids, particularly adapalene, are another great OTC option for treating acne. They work by speeding up the skin’s natural cell turnover process, which helps unclog pores and resolve acne more quickly. “Retinoids not only treat the acne you have today, they also change the way the cells turn over, reducing your development of acne tomorrow,” Heidi Waldorf, M.D., the director of laser and cosmetic dermatology at the Mount Sinai Hospital, tells SELF. These are especially effective when used alongside benzoyl peroxide, the AAD says. To make sure you don’t miss a spot when applying topical creams and gels, Waldorf recommends using an applicator like the L’applique to help you reach those hard-to-get-to areas.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nDifferin Gel, $15, Amazon\r\n\r\nLa Roche Posay Effaclar Adapalene Gel 0.1%, $30, Amazon\r\n\r\nAcne Free Adapalene Gel 0.1%, $12, Amazon\r\n\r\nSalicylic acid might work too. This classic acne-fighting ingredient works as a chemical exfoliant, breaking down dead skin cells and getting deep into pores to clear them out. It’s a common ingredient in spot treatments, but those might be hard to use on your back. “Salicylic acid is attracted to the oil in the sebaceous glands, and once there, it helps to loosen the sticky cells and oil to clear clogged hair follicles,” Dr. Waldorf says.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nNeutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, $7, Target\r\n\r\nMurad Acne Body Wash, $44, Murad\r\n\r\nDermaologica Clearing Skin Wash, $62, Ulta\r\n\r\nDevelop good workout habits. Working out and sweating can contribute to body acne, so it’s important to be mindful when you’re engaging in those activities. The AAD recommends opting for looser fitting clothes made of sweat-wicking fabric or cotton to avoid sweat accumulating next to your skin. It’s also important to change out of sweaty workout clothes as soon as possible and to wash them after every use.\r\n\r\nBe gentle with your skin. If your skin has acne, it will require a gentle touch. That means using a gentle body wash or cleanser—not a harsh scrub. It also means avoiding the very tempting urge to pick your acne as much as possible.\r\n\r\nWear sunscreen. Sun exposure can actually worsen acne and cause post-acne dark spots to become darker. Although wearing sunscreen is always important, it’s especially important if you’re trying to manage back acne. Look for products that are non-comedogenic and oil-free, which means they won’t contribute to clogged pores.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nEltaMD UV Lotion Broad-Spectrum SPF 30, $36, Dermstore\r\n\r\nHawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch Lotion Sunscreen SPF 50, $19, Amazon\r\n\r\nClinique Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Mineral Sunscreen For Body, $32, Sephora\r\n\r\nAvoid anything that rubs your skin. The friction caused by a backpack or or shoulder bag can worsen acne, especially if you’re also sweaty. If you can, hold your purse in your hand or rest the strap on your arm.\r\n\r\nTake care when washing your hair. The way you wash your hair can have an impact on bacne. While the oils in hair treatments might be good for nourishing your strands, they can be bad news for the skin on your back. That’s why Debbie Palmer, D.O., tells SELF that you should rinse conditioner off to the side instead of letting it run down your back. Also, try waiting until you’ve completed all of your hair treatments before washing your body. That way you can wash off any oily residue, clearing the way for your acne treatments to do their thing.\r\n\r\nWhen should you see a dermatologist for back acne?\r\n\r\nYou can probably treat mild to moderate back acne at home with over-the-counter options. But if your acne is more severe, meaning you have deep, painful cysts, you should see a dermatologist for help. They may prescribe stronger medications, like prescription retinoids, that can help clear your acne.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not sure if your acne is actually acne, you should also see your dermatologist. There are other skin conditions, including “fungal acne,” that can look a lot like regular acne but that require more specialized treatments.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:25:22', '2021-05-28 19:25:23', '/resources/images/wps11.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/how-to-get-rid-of-back-acne', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (126, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Tan Lines—Without Any More Sun Exposure', 'You don\'t need to risk more sun!', '![img](/resources/images/wps12.png)\r\n\r\nWhen you get home from a long day in the sun, your first instinct might be to figure out how to get rid of those tan lines you accidentally picked up. Of course, you were wearing sunscreen and covering up as much as possible, but even those of us most dedicated to sun safety slip up every once in a while—and pay the price in sun damage and annoying tan lines.\r\n\r\nYou might assume that, to even out your skin tone, you need to get back in the sun or into a tanning bed. But that will only expose you to even more sun damage—and there are plenty of ways to get rid of tan lines without that. In fact, as SELF explained previously, tanning is the direct result of UV exposure to the skin. Over time, that kind of UV exposure can lead to more permanent damage to the skin as well as skin cancer, the CDC says.\r\n\r\nSo, while it’s understandable that you’d want to address the cosmetic concerns of tan lines, it’s important not to use intentional tanning—indoor or outdoor—to do that. Below, check out how to get rid of tan lines with a few safer tips. Not only will your skin tone even out, but your skin might also feel smoother, more moisturized, and more nourished after taking on some of these tips.\r\n\r\n1. Wear sunscreen.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to lighten a tan or even out your skin tone, sunscreen is undoubtedly the most important part of your skin-care arsenal. Wearing sunscreen every day—yes, every single day—will help protect you from UV damage and therefore prevent the parts of your skin that are already tan from continuing to get tan.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nLa Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Milk Sunscreen SPF 100 ($25, Amazon)\r\n\r\nCOOLA Mineral Body Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 ($32, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nBanana Boat Simply Protect Sensitive Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50+ ($8, Target)\r\n\r\n2. Gently exfoliate.\r\n\r\nExfoliating your skin helps remove the outer layer of dead skin cells so that the newer, smoother skin cells underneath are revealed. You can do this with a physical exfoliant, like a scrub, or with a chemical exfoliant, a product containing something like glycolic acid or lactic acid. Over time, this will help your tan to fade, and it’s an important step before using a self-tanner, if that’s something you’re interested in. But be careful not to do this too often because exfoliating with products like these can irritate those with dry or sensitive skin.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nGlytone Exfoliating Body Wash ($32, Amazon)\r\n\r\nPaula’s Choice Weightless Body Treatment 2% BHA ($28, Paula’s Choice)\r\n\r\nShea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Skin Renewal Recipe Body Scrub ($11, Ulta)\r\n\r\n3. Moisturize and use self-tanner.\r\n\r\nAfter exfoliating in the shower, dry off well and load your fave moisturizer onto the already tanned areas to help create a barrier for when you apply the self-tanner. Then dip a makeup sponge into a quality self-tanning gel and blend color evenly into the paler skin; hang tight until it feels dry. You can use a self-tanning cream, but I like gel because it\'s easier to apply on smaller areas of skin. Repeat the exfoliate, lotion, tan routine daily until lines aren\'t noticeable.\r\n\r\nLung Cancer: Myth Vs.

Use body makeup.\r\n\r\nIf you’d prefer to cover your tan lines, try using body makeup. First, take off any clothes near tan lines to avoid staining your clothes and missing major areas. Then dip your index finger into a matte liquid bronzer or body foundation and tap a thin layer over the pale spots. Give it 15 seconds or so to dry, then reassess. If you need to go darker, add another layer. Once you nail your skin tone, gently sweep a bronzing powder over the entire area to help blend the faux with the glow, and finish with a spritz of makeup setting spray.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nDermablend Leg and Body Makeup ($34, Ulta)\r\n\r\nKKW Beauty Skin Perfecting Body Foundation ($45, Ulta)\r\n\r\nDior Backstage Face & Body Foundation ($40, Sephora)\r\n\r\n5. Try body products with vitamin C.\r\n\r\nIf those methods aren’t enough for you, you can also try using body products containing ingredients like vitamin C and niacinamide, which can help lighten hyperpigmentation. These are ingredients commonly used in skin-care products for the face aimed at reducing hyperpigmentation and just overall evening out skin tone. However, they generally take a few weeks to see a noticeable difference.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nM-61 Vitablast C Body Butter ($24, bluemercury)\r\n\r\nOne Love Organics Vitamin C Body Oil ($58, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nAveeno Positively Radiant Body Lotion ($28, Amazon)\r\n\r\n6. Wait it out.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get rid of tan lines is to just wait for them to naturally fade on their own while avoiding sun exposure as much as possible. In fact, your skin cells are constantly in a state of turning over, meaning the newer cells are pushed to the surface as the older skin cells die and flake off. So it’s estimated that, within about 7 to 10 days, your tan will fade significantly—as long as you’re not reexposing the skin to UV light.\r\n\r\nHow to prevent tan lines in the future:\r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent annoying tan lines in the future is to avoid getting a tan at all. That requires wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 anytime you’re exposed to the sun. But it also means trying to stay in the shade as much as possible, wearing clothing that covers your skin (and maybe even contains extra sun protection), and not spending extended time outdoors when the sun is at its strongest.\r\n\r\nTan lines certainly aren’t the most dangerous effect of sun exposure, but they can be annoying—and a sign that you may need to bump up your sun-safety habits.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:25:57', '2021-05-28 19:25:58', '/resources/images/wps12.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/beauty-how-to-fix-tan-lines', 0, 0);

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to keeping breakouts at a minimum, I have a handful of holy-grail skincare go-tos to help appease my finicky, combination skin. As a person who’s tried to do away with zits since the early days of middle school, I have a pretty clear understanding nowadays of the products that will work for me, from the moment they first touch my face. Since one of my long-term skin goals is to have the flexibility to just wear makeup for funsies instead of out of necessity, locking down an effective skincare routine as a foundation is key.\r\n\r\nAs the foundation of any good skincare routine, cleansing is a must, but finding a good cleanser has been the missing piece of my routine for a while. I typically rotate between a few that do the job, but don’t really check off all the boxes for my skin-care needs, which is why I was so surprised by how instantly I took to Space Wash, the new cleanser from buzzy skin-care brand, Starface.\r\n\r\nI’d become a fast fan of buzzy skin-care brand Starface (which was started by former ELLE beauty editor Julie Schott, who, it must be said, has amazing skin) after discovering how effective their cult-favorite Hydro-Stars were. The stars are the brand’s first- and best-sellers, hydrocolloid pimple patches in the shape of—you guessed it—stars, that make even the act of healing zits look cute, and their first-ever cleanser is similarly well-suited for my combination and acne-prone skin.\r\n\r\nSome cleansers have stung my eyes mid-wash, smelled overly perfumed, or left my skin feeling super tight and uncomfortable, but Space Wash is different—this cleanser truly gets me. Formulated with soothing ingredients like sage leaf and calendula flower extract, as well as white willow bark extract to help exfoliate skin, this cleanser has rewarded me with clarity and smoothness every time I use it. It has a barely-there scent with no added fragrance, feels very gentle on my skin, and doesn’t leave behind a sticky residue once it’s rinsed off. Not to mention, it’s comedogenic, dermatologist-tested, oil-free, and vegan.\r\n\r\nAfter rinsing my face, I squirt a nickel-size amount of the cleanser in one palm, add a hint of water, then rub my hands together to form a light, frothy lather. Space Wash is extra silky when I massage it on my face, and once it’s rinsed off, my skin feels clean but not stripped, a common characteristic of other acne-friendly cleansers I’ve used in the past. Not only is its formula absolutely everything for my skin, but the vibrant Space Wash tube (like all Starface products) is one of the best-looking beauty products on my shelf, and also completely recyclable once I’m done with it, which means it’s better for the environment, too.\r\n\r\nI’m so into this cleanser, that at this rate, I’m at a danger of overdoing it on my face washing routine. But if I do get a little heavy handed, I’m lucky that the product is also pretty affordable at $16 a tube and available for auto-refills, which I have to wager that you’ll want to do.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:26:20', '2021-05-28 19:26:21', '/resources/images/wps13.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/starface-space-wash-cleanser-review', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (128, 14, 'This Is Why Your Skin Is All Over the Place Right Now', 'Raise your hand if you’re breaking out!', '![img](/resources/images/wps14.png)\r\n\r\nNow that most of us are spending extra time at home thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, we’ve started to tune in to our skin in a way we didn’t necessarily have time for previously—and some of us aren’t too pleased with what we’re seeing.\r\n\r\nFor some, this time at home has finally allowed us to scale back on all those products, revealing clear skin with—surprise!—a minimalist routine. But others are finding themselves battling breakout after breakout, Carol Cheng, M.D., assistant clinical professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the Acne Procedure Clinic at UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, tells SELF. “I’ve seen it go both ways,” she says, “and I can see a number of reasons why.”\r\n\r\nWhether your skin is getting better these days or…not, here’s what might be behind those changes.\r\n\r\nThere are tons of factors that could be affecting your skin right now—for better or worse.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to remember that some acne triggers aren’t going to change right now, Dr. Cheng says, such as the hormonal influence on skin and acne. But here are a few things that might be making a difference on your skin.\r\n\r\nStress, sleep, diet. People’s skin may respond to things like changes in stress, diet, and sleep in different ways, and we don’t totally understand why, Dr. Cheng says. But if you notice that your skin is behaving badly right now, it makes sense that it might have something to do with these other big changes in your environment and behavior right now.\r\n\r\nUsing fewer skin-care products. “Part of what’s helping people is they are cleaning up their routine,” Mary L. Stevenson, M.D., assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. Not having to go into an office every day is giving us the freedom to cut back on our skin-care regimens and really take the time to be thoughtful about what we’re putting on our face—perhaps we’re even doing it over the course of a morning rather than in 30 seconds before rushing out the door!\r\n\r\nFor some, that minimalism might make them realize they didn’t actually need all those products and that some of them might have even been making their skin break out or irritated. But some of us really do rely on those products to keep our skin calm and clear, Dr. Stevenson says, so taking a break could have a detrimental effect on our skin.\r\n\r\nWorking out at home. If you, like many of us, have gone from working out at your favorite gym or studio class to exclusively working out at home, that could also be having an effect on your skin, Dr. Stevenson says. At home you have time to take off your makeup, you’re not working out in the same room as 25 other sweaty people, and you can clean off all that sweat immediately after you’re done rather than waiting a full subway ride to shower at home. Having that much newfound control over your fitness environment could lead to overall less irritated and less acne-prone skin.\r\n\r\nWearing less makeup. As with skin care, a lot of us are finding that there’s less of a need to wear makeup daily because we’re leaving home so much less often. Personally, outside of the occasional Zoom call, I basically don’t wear any makeup these days, and my skin has been pretty into it. That could be because the products I was wearing are irritating, or it could just be the simple fact of not having an extra layer of stuff on top of my skin helps prevent acne. “The most irritating thing we do is too much,” Dr. Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nSitting in front of screens constantly. Yes, if you are prone to hyperpigmentation, the blue light from your devices might exacerbate that, SELF explained previously. But the bigger risk of sitting idly in front of your laptop, phone, tablet, et cetera for hours on end is that you’re more likely to absent-mindedly pick at or touch your face, Dr. Cheng says, which can contribute to acne and interfere with the skin’s normal healing process.\r\n\r\nWearing face masks. If you’ve been wearing a face mask when in public (which, yes, you should be), you’ve probably noticed how quickly it can get hot and sweaty under there. You may have also noticed that you’re getting acne in the areas of your face that are under the mask. That could be thanks to acne mechanica, Dr. Cheng says, which is caused by something physically trapping that warmth and sweat on your skin.\r\n\r\nTake this opportunity to work on your relationship with your skin.\r\n\r\nOne of the few, tiny silver linings of having this time at home is being able to take the opportunity to more closely monitor your skin and how your products affect it, Dr. Stevenson says. But it’s also important to recognize when you’re paying too much attention to your skin, which can be especially difficult right now if you deal with OCD or a body-focused repetitive disorder that involves skin picking.\r\n\r\nIn general, Dr. Stevenson recommends checking in on your skin at three points during the day: when you wake up, when you get home from work, and before you go to bed. Right now, obviously, many of us don’t get home from work, we just are home and also working. So the blurring of that line can be a little difficult to navigate. It might require you to pick a time when your work day is usually over. Still, try to take those moments—and only those moments—throughout the day to tune in to your skin. And, as SELF explained previously, setting time limits like this is one crucial strategy to managing skin-fueled OCD symptoms.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it’s completely understandable that, with so many changes in our lives, our skin might be going through some changes too. And, for most of us, the changes will be relatively minor and easy to manage with our usual acne- and irritation-fighting strategies. But if your skin changes are causing extra stress or you don’t know what’s causing those changes, it’s worth checking in with a dermatologist about what you can do to deal with them.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:26:40', '2021-05-28 19:26:47', '/resources/images/wps14.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/skin-changes', 0, 0);

It looks like a magical dust that transforms into an even coat of paint. But it\'s completely different from nail polish. A regular manicure can chip immediately after you leave the salon, but most dip-powder manicures claim to last up to three weeks longer than gel manicures. So when my nail tech asked if I wanted to try it out, I was down. But I found out that it isn\'t a new technique at all, dip powder has actually been around since the ‘80s.\r\n\r\nThe name dip powder basically explains the process. First, a base coat is applied, and the nail is dipped into a powder. The process is repeated a couple of times depending on how many coats you want. Then, the rough, powdery layers are transformed into a smooth, glossy finish once a sealant is applied. The best part: You don\'t have to worry about the possibility of skin damage from UV lamps. Unlike the classic gel manicure, it dries instantly. And the powders don\'t pose any inhalation threats, according to chemist Doug Schoon, president of Schoon Scientific + Regulatory Consulting and co-chair of Nail Manufacturer’s Council. That\'s why it\'s being marketed with words like \"safe,\" \"natural,\" and \"organic.\" However those claims aren\'t regulated, and choosing the powders over gel manis isn\'t necessarily a better choice.\r\n\r\nRelated: If You Get Gel Manicures, This Is What You Need To Know About UV Lamps And Skin Cancer\r\n\r\nIn fact, gel manicures, dip powders, and traditional nail extensions have more in common than you think. They are all made up of an acrylic base. \"All of the ingredients used to make any type of artificial nail—whether they be glued, cured by UV, or mixed with a liquid and powder—are based on the acrylic family,\" Schoon says.\r\n\r\nSo, how do dip powders differ from acrylic nails and gel manicures? The grains are finer, which allows them to be created in more vibrant colors. Dip powders are bonded using a glue called cyanoacrylate, which is also the main ingredient in Krazy Glue. \"Acrylic nails\", on the other hand, are applied by combining a liquid with a powder to form a gel. Similarly, the ingredients in gel manicures are like pre-mixed acrylics, and they undergo a chemical reaction once they are cured with a UV lamp.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRelated: What Your Nails Can Tell You About Your Health\r\n\r\nSo, in theory they are all the same. But that doesn\'t mean that they are all bad for your nails. Schoon says that you could wear acrylics for years without harming your nails. You\'ll only see problems if the application, maintenance, or removal techniques are done incorrectly. That\'s why it\'s important to find a salon that doesn\'t rush during the removal process. The dip-powder manicures soak off just like gel manis but can take longer. \"One thing that people don’t understand is that if it says soak for fifteen minutes to remove, that’s the minimum time,\" Schoon says. And the longer you leave the acrylics on, the longer it will take to soak them off. \"It may be fifteen minutes if you take them off the same day, but if you wait two weeks or four weeks, it could take thirty minutes.\" The last thing you want to do is scrape off layers of your nails, so it\'s worth it to be patient. And there is no such thing as gently scraping. \"That\'s like saying I punched you gently in the nose,\" Schoon says.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to reserve dip powder and other acrylic-based manicures for special occasions. \"This may be great as a one time use when you want stronger nails,\" says celebrity nail stylist Elle. The acrylics will create a hard surface on your nails while you\'re wearing them. So, find a technician that won\'t rush through any steps, and one that can talk to you about how to properly take care of your nails in between appointments.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:12:14', '2021-05-28 19:12:17', '/resources/images/wps6.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/dip-powder-nail-polish-manicures', 0, 0);

But, she recently revealed, those manis come at a price. Rushmore-Perrin told the Daily Mail that she’s been getting acrylics for six years. She says she has them done professionally and usually has them removed by professionals, but she recently didn’t have time to visit the salon and decided to DIY. “One nail had come off, and I didn’t want to have nine nails on, so I started peeling and snapping them off,” she said. “I then soaked the remains off in acetone.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that didn’t end well. Rushmore-Perrin posted a photo on Twitter of her torn, cracked, and bleeding nails after she removed her acrylic manicure herself. In another tweet, she said the pain was excruciating. “Nearly cried in the shower at the hot water touching my nail beds and I\'m pretty sure there\'s still loads of shampoo left in my hair,\" she replied to the tweet. “Don’t even care how they look, it’s the physical PAIN dear lord.”\r\n\r\nRushmore-Perrin posted another photo of her much healthier-looking nails less than a week afterward. “Five days later, after taking two different kinds of biotin every day,” she captioned the photo. “Still not amazing or beautiful, but LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, biotin is necessary for the formation of fatty acids and glucose, which fuel the body. Biotin is also a B vitamin that helps provide the necessary building blocks for healthy hair and nail production, Joshua Zeichner, M.D., a New York City-based board-certified dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Rushmore-Perrin\'s case, doctors doubt biotin helped repair her nails. Your nails are only really alive at the base, Doris Day, M.D., a clinical associate professor of dermatology at the New York University Langone Medical Center, tells SELF. By the time nails grow beyond the cuticle, they’re just dead cells, similar to your hair. Therefore, any potential benefits from biotin supplements will be seen from the base on up, which is why Gary Goldenberg, M.D., medical director of the Dermatology Faculty Practice at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells SELF that although biotin is helpful in the development and growth of nails, it can take six to 12 months for people to see results. Day is skeptical Rushmore-Perrin\'s progress is due to the biotin, adding that the beauty blogger\'s nails likely got better because she stopped putting acrylics on and they had time to heal.\r\n\r\nAngelica Ross Gets a Buzz Cut, Talks Womanhood & Radical Blackness\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt\'s usually not necessary to take biotin for hair and nail benefits because it\'s rare for people to be deficient in biotin, Day says. That means people’s bodies typically make healthy hair and nails just fine without additional supplementation. If you do use a supplement, Zeichner says you won’t see any changes to hair and nails you already have. What you can expect, if your body is deficient in biotin, is new hair and nail growth that\'s potentially stronger and healthier than you\'re used to. Jill Waibel, M.D., founder and owner of The Miami Dermatology and Laser in Institute, tells SELF that biotin has been found to be especially helpful with brittle nails, which makes sense since that\'s a common sign of biotin deficiency.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to keep in mind: Supplements are unregulated and can definitely be dangerous or cause unpleasant side effects (many biotin-supplementing people complain of cystic acne online) if you take too many of them. Instead of popping a supplement, Goldenberg points out that it\'s better to get the vitamin from foods such as avocados, fish, and legumes.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re still intrigued, check in with your doctor or dermatologist—they\'ll be able to determine whether you have some sort of deficiency affecting your nails or hair, then be able to figure out an action plan from there.\r\n', 0, '2021-05-28 19:15:20', '2021-05-28 19:15:17', '/resources/images/wps7.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/biotin-nails-acrylics-repair', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (134, 14, 'What Is Dermaplaning and Should You Try It?', 'Here\'s what experts say you should know.', '![img](/resources/images/wps1-1622200668692.png) \r\n\r\nYou may have seen people on YouTube shaving their faces using small razors to exfoliate their skin or get rid of facial hair and wondered, “What is dermaplaning, and should I try it?”\r\n\r\nWhile those YouTube tutorials may make dermaplaning look like an easy “do it yourself” procedure, experts say you should avoid trying this at home for several reasons that we will explain. Plus, dermaplaning is not recommended for all skin types, so it’s best to consult with a dermatologist about whether it’s right for you. Below, dermatologists explain what you should know about dermaplaning, including the risks, benefits, and cost.\r\n\r\n***\\*What is dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nDermaplaning is a cosmetic procedure that involves scraping your face with a scalpel to remove the e pidermis—your top layer of skin—and small hairs, explains Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D., professor of dermatology, medicine, and nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Traditionally, people have the procedure done in a dermatologist’s office, however, you can find blades at the drugstore marketed for at-home dermaplaning use. That said, it’s safer for a professional to perform this. (We’ll get to all of that in a bit.) It’s also always a good idea to research any procedure you’re interested in, even if you delay the actual procedure itself because of the pandemic. (Here’s more information to help you navigate making medical appointments during COVID-19). \r\n\r\nDuring a dermaplaning session, the dermatologist uses a medical-grade scalpel to scrape across the surface of the skin. The treatment takes about 15 minutes, and it can cost anywhere from $40 to more than $150, depending on where you go.\r\n\r\n***\\*What are the benefits of dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nThe main reason people do it is to remove the vellus hairs on their faces, which some people refer to as peach fuzz. Everyone has these fine vellus hairs coating their bodies, and they serve a purpose: Vellus hairs keep us warm and add another layer of protection to the skin. But some people’s vellus hairs are thicker and more visible than others, and depending on how they feel about that, they might want to have it removed. Of course, dermaplaning is just one way to do that. There are many at-home hair removal kits that may get the job done, including the Glee Face Wax Hair Removal Strips for Women ($9, Walmart.com) that a SELF editor loves. However, dermatologist Rosemarie Ingleton, M.D., tells SELF that typical hair-removal methods like waxing and threading don’t always provide the results people are looking for, which makes dermaplaning an appealing option. You may have heard that shaving hair on your face makes hair grow back thicker—that’s technically not true. But it may look thicker or darker, thanks to having a blunter tip from shaving as it grows out, according to the Mayo Clinic.\r\n\r\nPeople might try laser hair removal for longer-lasting results, according to Jeanine Downie, M.D., a dermatologist in New Jersey. This method damages the hair follicles using heat, so your strands don’t grow back as easily. Although it is marketed as a permanent option, your hair may grow back after any hormonal changes (like menopause), according to the Cleveland Clinic. It also takes several sessions to see changes. The exact amount varies, and generally, people with dark skin need more sessions compared to people with light skin. This option also doesn’t work on gray hairs.\r\n\r\nDr. Ingleton says that the biggest reason she does dermaplaning in her practice is to remove vellus hairs, but that the blade also gets rid of a superficial layer of dead skin. This can make your skin look brighter, help your skin-care products sink in better, and make your foundation go on smoother. In Dr. Ingleton’s practice, dermaplaning is often an add-on done before other treatments like microdermabrasion or ablative lasers like Fraxel. When it comes to exfoliating, there are no studies showing how dermaplaning compares to other treatments like retinoids or chemical peels, says Dr. Kim. That’s one reason why Dr. Downie prefers to use peels over dermaplaning—even for sensitive skin—and doesn’t offer dermaplaning in her practice. “Peels help to improve texture, tone, acne, and fine lines,” she says. “They are not equivalent at all, and many peels give deeper exfoliation than a scalpel,” Dr. Downie says.\r\n\r\nIs it ok to try dermaplaning at home?\r\n\r\nWhile it might feel like getting rid of these hairs is easy to do at home with an inexpensive blade, professionals warn against it. Any blade you get over-the-counter won’t be as sharp—or as effective—as the medical-grade scalpel used at the office. Also, there’s always the chance you will cut yourself in the process, potentially causing scarring.\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nAnytime a sharp object goes near your face, there is a risk of damage to the skin. Dr. Downie says that she’s seen patients with scarring after a dermaplaning session gone wrong. Although some medical spas offer dermaplaning, Dr. Downie recommends seeing a professional board-certified dermatologist for this kind of procedure. Board certification is an extra certification step that shows a physician completed advanced training in their specialty. (You can find a board-certified specialist by visiting The American Academy of Dermatology website.)\r\n\r\n***\\*How often should you have dermaplaning done?\\****\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the hair away, you might have to get treated about once a month. (Of course, the exact timeline will look different for each person.) Dr. Kim says this is not a treatment you should do too frequently. Our epidermis helps protect us from allergens and other potential irritants in the outside world—dermaplaning too often may irritate or damage that top layer of protection, she says. Again, this is why it’s best to consult with a physician who can help you decide on the appropriate frequency for your skin and needs.\r\n\r\n***\\*When should you avoid dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nThere are a few instances where you should think twice before signing up for dermaplaning. If you have acne, there is a chance that the blade could nick a pimple, says Dr. Downie, which means it would take longer to heal. So if you have something like a serious cystic breakout happening, it might be best to postpone. Ideally, you want to consult with a doctor who has experience with acne-prone patients. Also, tell your dermatologist if you have a history of cold sores. “If you have a breakout of cold sores, you need to be on Valtrex, and the physician ne eds to avoid the area,” says Dr. Downie. Without the use of a preventive oral anti-herpes medication, the cold sores can spread due to microtears in the skin.\r\n\r\n***\\*Is there anything else to know about dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nAfter a dermaplaning treatment, you do need to take care of your skin. “You have to coat your skin with sunblock afterwards because you’re going to be more sensitive to the sun,” says Dr. Downie. “You also have to be cautious of retinol and glycolic acids.” Dermatologists recommend that people with sensitive skin use a light moisturizer like Vanicream ($36, Amazon) because it doesn’t contain fragrances or other irritants. If you do choose to try dermaplaning, just be sure to work with a professional dermatologist for the safest possible experience.\r\n\r\nAll products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (135, 14, 'How to Manage Retinization When Using Retinoids', 'The first month on retinoids can be brutal.', '![img](/resources/images/wps2.png)\r\n\r\nBeauty editors praise retinoids for being a skin-care ingredient that seemingly does it all. They’re powerful enough to decrease acne, pigmentation, and wrinkles. But first comes the retinization period, where you might experience reddened, peeling, and dry skin. During this time, your skin is adjusting to the medication, and let’s not mince words, it sucks.\r\n\r\nIf you previously tried retinoids but thought they weren’t for you because of the side effects, then we have some good news: You can try again if you want. “Almost everyone can use retinoids if you tailor it to yourself,” Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D, professor of Dermatology, Medicine, and Nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, tells SELF. The key is figuring out the right strength and how often you can use it, she says. Even most of her patients with rosacea or sensitive skin can generally use a mild retinoid sparingly, she explains.\r\n\r\nWe spoke to a few experts about what you should know about retinoids and tips to keep in mind.\r\n\r\n1. What are retinoids, and why should you use them?\r\n\r\nThere’s a good chance you’ve heard of “retinols,” and you might be wondering if they are different from retinoids. It’s easiest to think of retinoids as a family of compounds derived from vitamin A, explains Dr. Kim. Then, there are retinols, or a form of retinoids commonly found in over-the-counter skin care products, and retinoic acid, found in prescription medications. But again, these are all forms of vitamin A, which can help your skin cells turn over more quickly when applied topically.\r\n\r\n“It’s very confusing because people just call everything retinols, but there are differences,” says Dr. Kim. The most important thing for you to remember is that retinoic acid requires a prescription and retinols can be found in products at your drugstore. Retin-A, or tretinoin as it’s called generically, is one popular brand of prescription retinoic acid.\r\n\r\nRetinoids may reduce wrinkles because they activate your skin’s natural collagen and elastin (two fibers that keep it strong). They’re also good exfoliators since they force your skin cells to turn over more quickly, which helps reduce acne, says Dr. Kim. In six to eight weeks, retinoids can clear up and prevent acne, reduce the look of fine lines, and lighten hyperpigmentation until it disappears. But prescription retinoids are strong stuff, so your skin is likely to get sensitive and irritated as it gets used to their mechanisms of action. Over-the-counter retinols can cause light irritation, but it\'s less severe since they are formulated to be gentler than prescription options. Because retinols are weaker, you may not notice skin changes, e.g., less acne, for several months, Dr. Kim says.\r\n\r\n2. What is retinization?\r\n\r\nLike we said, retinization is that period where your skin is adjusting to the retinoids. Generally, your skin may feel irritated, dry, and begin peeling, explains Dr. Kim. It starts a few days after you first start applying the medication and can last about a month (give or take a couple weeks) while your skin builds up a tolerance. Even people with sensitive skin can generally use some form of retinoids, says Dr. Kim. However, they might need to try the following skin care strategies to help reduce irritation, especially if using a prescription retinoid. Or, people with sensitive skin may need to try over-the-counter retinols since these are less irritating. Dr. Kim likes Differin Gel ($16, Amazon.com) since it was previously available by prescription and has been well-tested. As with most health concerns, it is best to consult with a dermatologist who can help you develop a plan that works for your specific skin. Right now, many physicians are offering virtual appointments using video chat. (Here’s what you need to know about scheduling medical appointments during COVID-19).\r\n\r\n3. Prepare your skin before starting retinoids.\r\n\r\nThe best prep you can do for your new retinoid regimen is to make sure your face isn’t dehydrated. “Moisturized skin has a better barrier function,” meaning that it’s at peak protection for whatever you throw at it, Beverly Hills dermatologist and founder of SkinxFive Ava Shamban, M.D., tells SELF. She says that means starting on a solid moisturization routine—morning and night—at least a week or so before you begin using the medication.\r\n\r\n4. Apply moisturizer before your retinoid at night.\r\n\r\nLayering the retinoid over a gentle moisturizer will help temper any irritation. Look for a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, ceramides, antioxidants, or redness-relieving peptides. Finding the right moisturizer for your particular skin type isn’t always easy. You can read our guide on moisturizer if you need help finding a product you like. The CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Lotion ($18, Amazon.com) is one dermatologist-recommended pick that works well for combination skin, for instance.\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nNote: The skin around your eyes is extra sensitive, and you shouldn’t apply retinoids to the upper eyelids at the risk of getting product in your eye. Protect the entire eye area with a thick moisturizer before putting retinoids on the rest of your face.\r\n\r\n5. Don’t start by applying retinoids every day.\r\n\r\nRetinoids aren’t something you should apply every day from the start. You have to work your way up to regular use. “Start slowly applying twice per week and then gradually add another day until you have built up tolerance for daily use,” RealSelf dermatologist Michele Green, M.D., tells SELF. If your skin has an adverse reaction, such as excessive peeling, lay off the treatment for a couple days. Then, you can try again but decrease the amount of times you use it per week. For example, if you experienced irritation after using it four times in a week, then bump your frequency down to three and see how your skin reacts. Some people can only tolerate using retinoids about twice a week, explains Dr. Kim.\r\n\r\n6. Change to a simple skin-care routine.\r\n\r\nFor the first month of regular retinoid use, your skin is officially classified as “sensitive.” That means you need to change up your cleansing and exfoliating routine. “Using a gentle detergent cleanser will allow some natural oils to remain on the skin, reducing the likelihood of developing the irritant dermatitis,” says Dr. Shamban. She says to look for something that is cream-based like Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser ($10, Amazon.com).\r\n\r\nAlso give up your masks, peels, and exfoliating scrubs. “Retinol will naturally exfoliate the skin,” says Dr. Shamban. “There is no reason to do any kind of a manual dermabrasion or exfoliating.” Dr. Green adds that you should avoid applying any other skin-care products with retinol, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and glycolic acid as they can be too harsh on your skin during retinization.\r\n\r\n7. Treat dry patches with extra moisturizer.\r\n\r\nDry patches and peeling will likely happen when you use retinoids. Dr. Shamban recommends applying aloe gel or 1 percent hydrocortisone cream like CeraVe Anti-Itch Cream ($9, Amazon.com) during the day to help with flakiness and irritation.\r\n\r\n8. Be patient about your results.\r\n\r\n“In dermatology, people want to do something once and that’s it,” says Dr. Kim. However, she says that you need to be patient and play the long game when it comes to retinoids. “You want to use this for a long time to really see the benefit of what these can do for your skin,” she says. So if a prescription retinoid is irritating, then you may want to use a weaker retinol. Or your doctor may be able to prescribe you a lower-dose retinoid that your skin tolerates.\r\n\r\n9. Call your dermatologist if you’re in pain.\r\n\r\nYes, some redness and itchiness are expected, but if you have an extreme reaction, it needs professional attention. “If your face starts to look like a charred tomato, it’s time to back off and see a physician,” Dr. Shamban says. Dr. Green seconds this sentiment, “If the skin starts to crack and you have open lesions which are oozing, you should definitely stop using the product and see your dermatologist. Also, if you develop a rash, this could mean you are having an allergic reaction to the product.” Again, you may not feel comfortable with physical office visits right now. But your dermatologist may be able to provide care through a virtual session, so it’s worth calling their office to check.\r\n\r\nAdditional reporting by Melissa Matthews\r\n\r\nAll products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (136, 14, '10 Things to Know Before Trying Dermal Fillers', 'Read this before making your appointment.', '![img](/resources/images/wps3.png) \r\n\r\nOur bodies naturally change with age, and those differences might include new wrinkles on our faces or cheekbones that aren’t as high as they once were. Dermal fillers can help minimize these signs of aging if you’re unhappy with them.\r\n\r\nHowever, these changes are completely normal and occur when we lose some of the subcutaneous fat that supports our skin. Over time, the skin on the middle of our faces shifts down too, causing our cheeks to sag a bit, explains Mary Stevenson, M.D., dermatologist at NYU Langone Health. “Filler can be used to help lift and add support,” she tells SELF. It can also help soften wrinkles, Dr. Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nThere are several categories of dermal fillers, and they’re all generally administered in the same way (more on that in a bit). Before electing to have any type of cosmetic or medical procedure, it’s important to understand what the process entails and any potential risks. Understandably, you might also have concerns about visiting a doctor’s office during the pandemic. Our story about making medical appointments during COVID-19 can help you decide if now is the right time to schedule an elective procedure. But below, you’ll find information experts think you should know about dermal fillers\r\n\r\n1. What exactly are dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nFirst things first: Dermal fillers are not to be confused with Botox, injectable drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to smooth lines and wrinkles. The latter \"freezes\" muscles to reduce wrinkles, while dermal fillers are injectable implants approved by the FDA to help smooth skin and wrinkles. As the name implies, they are injected beneath your skin using a needle.\r\n\r\nAccording to the FDA, there are four categories of fillers. Each is named for the type of material they’re made with:\r\n\r\nHyaluronic acid is naturally produced by your body and already found in your skin and cartilage. Generally, fillers made with hyaluronic acid last between 6-12 months.\r\n\r\nCalcium hydroxylapatite is a mineral that is found in our bones. Fillers made with this material last up to 18 months.\r\n\r\nPoly-L-lactic acid is a biodegradable synthetic material that’s also used to make medical products like dissolvable stitches. These fillers may last up to two years.\r\n\r\nPolymethylmethacrylate beads are the only filler that can’t be absorbed by your body, meaning the results are permanent. They’re only used around the mouth.\r\n\r\nHyaluronic acid, which you may recognize as a common ingredient in some skincare products, is one of the most popular types of fillers, explains Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D, professor of dermatology, medicine, and nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Because it helps skin retain moisture, hyaluronic acid can make your face look more plump and hydrated. It\'s also used in lotions as a moisturizer, but no cream can restore lost volume—only injectable hyaluronic acid can do that. Juvéderm and Restylane are two popular name brand hyaluronic fillers that you may have heard of.\r\n\r\n2. How do I know which dermal filler to try?\r\n\r\nA good doctor will explain the ideal treatment plan for you, but know that the most natural-looking results may require more than one type of filler. There are many different brands of fillers within each category, and the products vary in how they should be used—like filling out cheeks—and concentration of the active ingredient, explains Dr. Kim. For example, Restylane, one brand of hyaluronic filler, has five different lines—and each is used for different reasons. \"Restylane Lyft has larger particle sizes—think of them like the bricks of a foundation,\" Whitney Bowe, M.D. a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, tells SELF. Those larger particles have the heft to \"rebuild\" thinned cheekbones, while a smaller particle size, as in Restylane Silk, works better for addressing fine lines and plumping lips.\r\n\r\n3. Why do people get dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nDr. Kim explains that patients come to her saying “they just want to look a little better,” without turning to cosmetic surgery. She uses dermal fillers to add in volume and smooth out wrinkles, which her patients are normally happy with, she says.\r\n\r\nWATCH\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nDermal fillers are particularly popular because patients see differences in their appearances before leaving her office, Dr. Kim says. Generally, people notice the desired changes from other non-surgical procedures, like Botox, after a few days.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note: Dermal fillers are not FDA-approved for body contouring procedures. In other words, they shouldn’t be used to increase the size of your breasts or butt.\r\n\r\n4. What precautions should I take before getting fillers?\r\n\r\nIt probably goes without saying, but safety should be your top priority when considering any medical procedure. Dr. Kim says visiting a board-certified dermatologist or a board-certified plastic surgeon is one way to ensure that your physician is experienced. This extra certification step shows that the doctor completed additional training in their particular specialty. (You can find a board-certified specialist by visiting The American Board of Plastic Surgery or the American Academy of Dermatology websites.) Even though dermal fillers are available at medical spas, you should see only licensed and trained physicians for any injectable treatment. There are risks for issues like infection, discoloration, and lumps if injections are done incorrectly.\r\n\r\nGiven that this is a cosmetic procedure, you understandably want to be satisfied with the results. One way to find a doctor whose work you like is by asking friends who have had this done for their recommendations. \"People are starting to be more open about injectables,\" Ava Shamban, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist in Los Angeles, tells SELF.\r\n\r\n5. What should I ask my doctor during the consultation?\r\n\r\n“I think as a patient you should always ask for a consultation first and then really talk about what your goal is and how they [the doctor] can help you,” says Dr. Kim. You may think you just want dermal fillers, but an expert could recommend another treatment—or a combination of treatments—based on your specific skin type and goals. For example, your doctor may suggest using laser therapy if you have a lot of pigmentation, she says.\r\n\r\nDr. Shamban advises requesting before-and-after photographs of real patients from the doctor’s office. Every practitioner has different philosophies, techniques, and levels of experience. And don\'t be afraid to ask about your doctor’s training and certification during the initial consultation.\r\n\r\nLastly, you and your physician should communicate about realistic results and your expectations—it\'s your face, after all.\r\n\r\n6. What are the possible side effects of fillers?\r\n\r\nEven non-surgical procedures have their risks. The most common side effects include bruising, redness, pain, or swelling, all of which should go away within two weeks, according to the FDA. Less frequently, people might get raised bumps under their skin that need to be treated with injections, medications, or even surgically removed, according to the FDA.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is rare, filler can accidentally be injected into a blood vessel and lead to blurred vision or permanent blindness. You should call your doctor or the emergency room if your skin turns blue and you’re in a lot of pain—these are two possible signs that filler is in your bloodstream. Again, this is why you want to see an experienced doctor who is skilled in performing the procedure.\r\n\r\n7. Who should avoid dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nAccording to the FDA, there’s no research showing that dermal fillers are safe for pregnant or breastfeeding people, so you may want to hold off if you’re expecting a baby or recently had a child. And here\'s one more thing to consider: Avoid getting filler right before a teeth cleaning or other dental treatment, Dr. Shamban says. These procedures require pressure and stretching of the face that could potentially misplace fillers. You can ask your doctor for their opinion regarding when it’s safe to get any future dental work during your consultation.\r\n\r\n8. How much do dermal fillers cost?\r\n\r\nIf the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. If you see a deal for inexpensive filler, be skeptical. \"You have to be careful,\" Dr. Shamban says, adding that counterfeit and diluted filler do exist. \"Ask to see the box, and look for a safety seal on it.\" The price of these fillers varies depending on the amount of product needed. In 2019, the average cost of hyaluronic acid fillers was $652 per syringe, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. They estimate that most patients need more than one syringe to achieve the results they’re looking for.\r\n\r\n9. Are dermal fillers permanent?\r\n\r\nIf you\'re unhappy with the way filler looks, don\'t panic—in most cases, you can have it adjusted. A dermatologist might inject additional filler for balance, or they can dissolve it altogether, depending on the type. \"The wonderful thing about hyaluronic acid fillers is that there\'s an enzyme that can be injected into the area to dissolve the product,\" Dr. Shamban says. \"It just goes away.\"\r\n\r\nBut when expertly injected, filler should look natural. \"The changes we can make are so subtle that nobody would notice,\" says Dr. Shamban. \r\n\r\n10. How long will the results last?\r\n\r\nSince the majority of fillers aren’t permanent, you\'ll have to keep going back to the doctor’s office if you love the results following your procedure. After about six months, your body naturally breaks down hyaluronic acid fillers. So, you have to get touch-ups once or twice a year to maintain the look. However, this is good news if you just want to try fillers once or twice, since the effects will fade away without any long-term risks.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:19:50', '2021-05-28 19:19:51', '/resources/images/wps3.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/dermal-fillers', 0, 0);

Whether it’s 100 degrees and humid or pouring rain, I make sure that my face is saturated with a healthy dollop of sun protection before leaving the house. I thought I’d discovered all my skin-care favorites—until I tried Supergoop! Play Everyday Lotion’s updated reef-safe sunscreen formula. \r\n\r\nI already count Supergoop!’s Unseen Sunscreen among my product ride-or-dies, but after emptying my last tube this summer, I decided to venture out of my comfort zone and test Supergoop! Play, which is suitable for both face and body. Typically I’m wary of two-in-one skin products (I don’t fully endorse the idea of body wash that also works for your face, for example). But I was willing to give this a shot because I love Supergoop!—and it didn’t disappoint.\r\n\r\nI totally get why this is called Everyday Lotion, since its consistency is just as creamy and lightweight as some of my favorite moisturizers. Although it goes on white, the sunscreen has an invisible finish once rubbed in, unlike a lot of lotions that leave a chalky cast. It’s nongreasy with a pleasantly mild scent, and my skin drinks this stuff up with little effort. Supergoop! Play\'s chameleon-like ability to work on both my face and body without triggering breakouts is truly a game changer, and I no longer have to bother switching between a bunch of sun-protection products on the regular. \r\n\r\nSince Supergoop! Play offers broad-spectrum SPF 50 protection, plus has a water- and sweat-resistant formula, I don’t worry about it wearing off during outdoor workouts. I can happily wear it in the ocean and actually feel good about it, as it is now officially a reef-safe sunscreen, meaning it doesn’t contain chemical UV filters like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are known to be harmful to coral reefs and other sea life. \r\n\r\nNow that I’ve added this new gold star to my list of skin-care go-tos, I’m ready to graduate from the handheld 2.4-ounce size right to the jumbo, easy-to-pump 18-ounce version.

INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (138, 14, 'Watch Shay Mitchell Get Her First Treatment for Post-Pregnancy Melasma ', 'A week later, she\'s already seeing results.', '![img](/resources/images/wps6.png) \r\n\r\nShay Mitchell, who gave birth to her daughter this past October, recently walked her Instagram followers through her first intense pulsed light therapy (IPL) treatment session. She sought out the treatment to help manage her melasma, a skin condition often associated with pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIn the IGTV post, Mitchell starts with a mirror selfie showing off her comfy outfit (and mask!). She announces that this is her first melasma treatment and offers some background information about melasma and IPL treatments. Then, after a quick shot of her face with numbing cream, Mitchell takes a moment to show the camera her “little melasma spot” just below her eye and points to a patch of melasma on her upper lip. “Especially for new moms,” she says. “We go out in the sun and this is what happens.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Mitchell says she was too nervous to take video during the actual treatment, immediately after it she reports that her face is numb and that the IPL felt like “a million little elastic bands hitting all over.” She also points out a few red areas on her face that the treatment had targeted. Her facial treatment continues with a soothing collagen mask.\r\n\r\nThen, Mitchell cuts to an update from a week after her first treatment. She seems happy with the results so far. Although she says it’s recommended to get another one or two treatments, after the first one she feels that “we’re on track to lightening these little guys up.”\r\n\r\nMelasma is a form of hyperpigmentation that frequently shows up during or after pregnancy. The condition is so frequently associated with pregnancy that it’s sometimes even called the mask of pregnancy, SELF explained previously. It usually causes patches of brown or grayish-brown skin on the cheeks, forehead, nose, upper lip, and chin. Those patches aren’t harmful or painful, and sometimes, they’ll fade away on their own. But some people may want to have them lightened or removed.\r\n\r\nFirst off, as Mitchell points out, melasma is exacerbated by UV exposure, so wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 is usually a mainstay of melasma treatment and maintenance. Plus, recent research suggests that those with melasma may benefit from using a sunscreen containing iron oxides, which help block visible light from the sun and devices, like your phone or laptop.\r\n\r\nFrom there, treatment usually involves topical medications, such as prescription hydroquinone, which can lighten skin, the American Academy of Dermatology explains. Tretinoin, a powerful retinoid that speeds up the cell turnover process, is another common choice, as are corticosteroid medications and azelaic acid. \r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nBut topical medications aren’t always enough, which is where treatments like the one Mitchell received come in. For more stubborn melasma, a dermatologist might recommend in-office procedures like microdermabrasion, chemical peels, or laser treatments. The specific treatment Mitchell got—IPL—is similar to laser treatments but involves the use of multiple light wavelengths to treat certain issues. It’s especially useful in managing hyperpigmentation, broken blood vessels sometimes seen in rosacea, and age spots.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that nonablative treatments like this stimulate the growth of new collagen by heating up the skin, SELF explained previously. However, for most skin conditions, multiple treatments are required for you to see noticeable results. Mitchell specifically mentions in her video that she’s hoping her melasma spots will look lighter after three sessions.\r\n\r\nAfter treatment, it’s normal for the skin to be a little red, swollen, and sensitive for a few hours or a few days, Baylor College of Medicine explains.

INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (139, 14, 'Here’s Why You Get Sun Spots on Your Face—And How to Treat Them', 'They’re usually harmless.', '![img](/resources/images/wps8.png) \r\n\r\nIf you’ve spent any time in the sun throughout your life, you may have developed some sun spots on your face. These spots (also called age spots, liver spots, or solar lentigines) appear as flat, smooth brown spots on areas of your skin that tend to get a lot of sun exposure.\r\n\r\nSun spots are generally harmless areas of pigmented skin, but they can be easily confused with other types of sun-related spots on the skin, including some that may actually be a sign of skin cancer. If you think you have sun spots on your face, it’s important to monitor them and to get anything that looks iffy checked out by a board-certified dermatologist.\r\n\r\nHere’s what you need to know about sun spots, how to prevent them, how dermatologists can treat or remove them, and signs to look for that may signal an issue.\r\n\r\nWhat causes sun spots on your face?\r\n\r\nSun spots on your face are a type of hyperpigmentation caused by UV exposure. Essentially, after being exposed to the sun, your skin increases production of melanin, the pigment that gives skin color. Over time, some areas of your skin may develop clumps of melanin or may overproduce that pigment, resulting in a sun spot, the Mayo Clinic explains.\r\n\r\nThese types of spots tend to show up on areas of your body where you get the most sun, which might include your face, shoulders, hands, chest, and the back of your hands, Mary L. Stevenson, M.D., assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. Sun spots tend to be flat rather than raised, are usually brown, and may appear in clusters.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to prevent sun spots?\r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent sun spots on your face is to develop and maintain solid sun safety habits. “They can be prevented with diligent sun protection including use of sunscreen on regular basis, and other forms of sun protection like hats, sun glasses, and clothing,” Nada Elbuluk, M.D., clinical assistant professor of dermatology (clinician educator), Keck School of Medicine of USC, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nThat includes using broad spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) every day, particularly on areas of your body that are prone to sun exposure, like your face, your shoulders, and the back of your hands. Sun spots are more likely to show up on people with lighter skin, Elbuluk says, but people with darker skin tones can still develop sun-related skin damage, so it’s important for everyone to wear sunscreen regularly.\r\n\r\nBut we know that it’s a bit difficult to stick to diligent sunscreen wearing (and reapplication) habits—and even perfect sunscreen usage doesn’t protect you from 100% of the sun’s rays. That’s why it’s crucial to also use other sun protection strategies, like wearing sun-protective clothing, sticking to the shade whenever possible, and wearing hats and sunglasses that block the sun.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nEltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 ($38, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nNeutrogena Ultra-Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreen SPF 30 ($10, Amazon)\r\n\r\nLa Roche Posay Anthelios Mineral Sunscreen Gentle Lotion SPF 50 ($22, Amazon)\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to treat sun spots?\r\n\r\nTrue sun spots are not harmful and don\'t need to be treated. If you do decide you want to have your sun spots treated or removed for cosmetic reasons, this is something you’ll likely have to see a professional about. Although you can certainly try some products containing the classic brightening ingredients, like hydroquinone, retinoids, or vitamin C, “over-the-counter products are typically not strong enough to have a significant effect on sun spots,” Elbuluk explains.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nAlthough some of those products can be helpful in preventing sun spots and generally evening out your skin tone, they aren’t likely to be enough once you have the spots, Stevenson says. So if you want to have a sun spot removed, you’ll need to talk to a board-certified dermatologist. They may recommend using a prescription-strength lightening cream or procedures such as professional chemical peels or laser treatments, Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nAfter a laser treatment, the spot will usually “turn a little white, crust, and then peel off,” Stevenson explains, so that you’re left with a subtly pink area that eventually fades. After doing all that work to have the spot removed, it’s really important to keep it from getting any more sun, she says, especially while it’s still healing, because laser treatments can make your skin more sensitive to sun exposure. In fact, Stevenson says she generally doesn’t treat sun spots during the summer because of this risk for more pigmentation after treatment. \r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes other types of spots (called seborrheic keratoses) are confused with sun spots, Stevenson says. Seborrheic keratoses, like sun spots, are harmless brown, tan, or black growths on the skin, the Mayo Clinic explains. However, unlike true sun spots, these marks tend to be slightly raised, which means they may need to be shaved down or destroyed with electrocautery. These procedures may then be combined with laser treatments to further remove the pigment. Many people who are prone to sun spots are also prone to seborrheic keratoses, so it’s common to have both Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nHyperpigmentation on the face might also be melasma, a condition that tends to appear in patches on the cheeks, forehead, nose, or chin, SELF explained previously.\r\n\r\nWhen should you talk to a dermatologist?\r\n\r\nAlthough true sun spots aren’t harmful, they are a result of sun damage and therefore can be a sign that you need to get better at protecting yourself from sun exposure.\r\n\r\nSometimes, cancerous spots on your skin can look like sun spots or seborrheic keratoses, the Mayo Clinic says. So if you have a lot of sun spots or you notice one that looks suspicious or odd, it’s always a good idea to get checked out by a dermatologist. \r\n\r\nIn particular, it’s important to take note of any spots that seem to be growing or changing rapidly. “If [you have] a brown spot that seems to be changing in size, color, or appearance, then it may not be a sun spot and should be examined by a board-certified dermatologist to rule out skin cancer,” Elbuluk says.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:20:57', '2021-05-28 19:20:59', '/resources/images/wps8.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/sun-spots-on-face', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (140, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Spider Veins and Varicose Veins', 'This isn’t a DIY situation.', '![img](/resources/images/wps9.png)\r\n\r\nIf you’re wondering how to get rid of spider veins, you’ve probably already come across a bunch of the internet’s suggestions. When I noticed a series of faint blue lines twisting around my thigh, some of the recommended home remedies I saw included ginger tea, massage, and even exercise. But here’s the honest truth: That’s all B.S. Visible veins aren’t something you can fix at home.\r\n\r\nSo I talked to dermatologists and surgeons who specialize in treating spider veins and varicose veins (the larger, raised visible veins that often appear on the legs). What I learned is that the underlying causes of these visible veins aren’t always preventable—and they can be a sign of a much deeper vein problem that no home remedy is likely to fix. Here’s how to get rid of spider veins for real—and why it’s so important to see a specialist to do so.\r\n\r\nWhat actually are spider veins?\r\n\r\nThere are two common types of visible veins: spider veins and varicose veins. “Spider veins are really small superficial veins that are in the outer layer of skin between the dermis and epidermis, so you can see them,” Christopher Hollingsworth, M.D., a general surgeon at NYC Surgical Associates, tells SELF. “If you live long enough, most people are going to get them.” These veins get their name because they look like thin, weblike, blue-and-purple lines on the legs.\r\n\r\nVaricose veins, on the other hand, are larger veins that are deeper in the body. “You won’t see them as a discoloration, you’ll see them when they get so stretched out that they kind of bulge,” Dr. Hollingsworth says.\r\n\r\nBecause these two issues are caused by similar blood-flow situations, varicose and spider veins commonly occur together. That means that people who have varicose veins almost always have spider veins too. However, some people get spider veins and never have a problem with varicose veins.\r\n\r\nWhat causes spider veins and other visible veins?\r\n\r\nTo understand why these visible veins develop, you’ve got to understand how blood flows through the body. Your heart pumps blood to your entire body through your blood vessels. From there, blood circulates outward toward the extremities (legs, arms, head) through the arteries and back inward to the heart through your veins.\r\n\r\n“Think of veins as being a hose that flows from bottom-up toward your heart,” says dermatologist Alicia Barba, M.D., of Barba Dermatology. “And there’s a little valve. When they work well, the blood shoots up and the valve closes. When it doesn’t work, the blood falls back down instead of moving north.”\r\n\r\nWhen blood flows in the wrong direction because of a valve problem, it can get backed up in the veins of the legs, which damages the walls of the vein, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) explains. That extra pressure on the vein walls gradually causes them to weaken and then bulge, creating veins we can actually see. In fact, the majority of people who have spider veins and/or varicose veins will be dealing with this type of “venous insufficiency,” Dr. Hollingsworth says.\r\n\r\nHowever, other factors can contribute to the likelihood that you’ll develop visible veins, including genetics, age, and your level of physical activity, the AAD says.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you have a job where you are standing still for long periods of time, gravity is at work pulling the blood back down toward the legs, causing the veins to get stretched out and the valves to weaken over time. If you sit all day at your job, you can also start to see visible veins because there is a lack of muscle movement. The muscles in the leg help the veins push the blood back up toward the heart, so moving around during the day can help prevent visible veins. (That rumor that crossing your legs can cause spider veins isn’t true, so go ahead and cross ’em if you like—just make sure that you get out of your chair and move around during the day to get the blood pumping.)\r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nThere is some research to suggest that carrying extra weight can impact the function of your veins and, therefore, also increase your risk for visible veins. Having more fat around your stomach (visceral fat) can increase the pressure in your abdomen, Dr. Hollingsworth says, which then creates an obstruction that blocks the flow of blood. “That increased pressure dilates the veins, which extends all the way through the lower vein bridge and all the way up to the veins in your skin,” he explains.\r\n\r\nA similar situation happens during pregnancy when the added pressure in the abdomen squeezes the veins. But the hormonal shifts that happen during pregnancy may also play a role. “When women are exposed to excess estrogen or progesterone, what it tends to do is make your soft tissue a little more flexible,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. “That same process, we think, is affecting the veins, making them predisposed to dilate and stretch out.” After pregnancy, the veins generally go away and everything returns to normal. This vein weakening can also happen if you’re taking hormonal birth control.\r\n\r\nAlthough visible veins may seem like a purely superficial issue, they can become painful when left untreated. “Spider and varicose veins make your legs sore because it’s an inflammatory process,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. “Those veins are getting dilated and stretched out. They’re trying to signal for help in the only way they know how, which is sending off a local inflammatory biochemical that causes your legs to swell and to be sore.” So preventing and treating spider veins can save you from a lot of discomfort.\r\n\r\nCan you do anything to prevent spider veins?\r\n\r\nThere are a few different underlying causes of vein issues that are preventable or reversible, while others aren\'t. For instance, if your visible veins are largely due to inherited factors, pregnancy, or how active you can be during the work day, that’s not likely something you have a ton of control over.\r\n\r\nBut there are some general things you can do to prevent them, such as maintaining physical activity during the day. If you sit at work all day, the AAD recommends getting up and walking around a bit every 30 minutes. Or, if you stand at work for long periods of time, the AAD recommends taking a break and sitting down every 30 minutes. And exercising in general, elevating your legs when possible, and avoiding soaking for long periods of time in hot baths can help prevent visible veins as well, the AAD says.\r\n\r\nHowever, these strategies can’t treat any visible veins you already have.\r\n\r\nYou’ll need to see a specialist to actually treat visible veins.\r\n\r\nIf you’re wondering how to get rid of spider veins for good, know that Dr. Hollingsworth says those wacky home remedies won’t work. Dry brushing? Nope. Fancy body lotions? Nah. Massage? It might feel good, but there won’t be a visible difference.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing really that you can do aside from the small minimally invasive treatments we have that is going to make spider veins look any better,” he says. “Creams, ointments, or rubbing aren’t going to make spider veins go away.”\r\n\r\nThe primary way that spider and varicose veins are treated is by using different surgical methods to close off the vein so that it collapses and the residual scar tissue stops the blood flow completely. These are all superficial veins, so other healthy veins just take over their circulation duties and the procedure won’t impact your overall health. Also, those with more serious, bulging varicose veins can have them removed completely once the vein is closed off.\r\n\r\nSclerotherapy: This is one of the more popular options for spider veins and varicose veins. A doctor injects a foamy detergent or concentrated saltwater solution into the problematic vein, which irritates the walls of the blood vessel, explains Neil Sadick, M.D., founder of Sadick Dermatology. This causes scar tissue to form, which leads the blood vessel to close. If someone is allergic to the sclerotherapy solution, there are other treatment options.\r\n\r\nLaser treatment: A vein surgeon or dermatologist might use a laser treatment to heat the vein, causing it to contract and scar over. Dr Hollingsworth uses a handheld Nd:YAG laser (the same machine that can be used in laser hair removal) on small spider veins. Or, if it’s a larger varicose vein, a laser may be inserted into the vein using a catheter to stop blood flow.\r\n\r\nMedical glue: For varicose veins, doctors might also use is the medical version of superglue. “Cyanoacrylate glue is a biologic glue that’s very similar to Krazy Glue,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. Surgeons close off a varicose vein by gluing it shut from the inside. “You inject it, wait for the glue to set, and move further down, and so on and so on.”\r\n\r\nRadio frequency ablation (RFA): This is another option for varicose veins that are so large that glue and sclero just float away. “RFA runs radio frequency through the inside of the vein and turns the inside of the vein into a lightbulb filament, heats it up, scars it, and kills it,” says Dr. Hollingsworth.\r\n\r\nTo prevent visible veins from getting worse, a surgeon might use RFA or internal laser techniques to close off a larger vein deeper in the leg that feeds the smaller varicose veins and spider veins. “There’s a central pipe in the leg called the saphenous vein; it’s the main superficial vein. Coming off those veins are truncal varicose veins,” Dr. Sadick says. Once the larger vein is taken care of, the smaller veins can be treated with sclerotherapy, glue, or a handheld laser.\r\n\r\nAll of these treatments are performed through tiny punctures in the skin, so you can likely schedule your procedure in the morning and go back to work in the afternoon. However, Dr. Barba warns about getting these treatments on darker skin tones, especially laser and RFA procedures, because those with darker skin tones have a higher risk for hyperpigmentation issues following the treatments. Plus, those pigmentation issues can be stubborn to treat. “Sometimes the pigmentation is a part of the healing process,” Dr. Barba says. “If you care about a little spider vein, you might care about the pigment that’s going to be there for a couple months.”\r\n\r\nWhatever treatment you go with, the key is to go to a doctor who specializes in vein treatments, whether that’s a dermatologist or a vein surgeon. “If you want have anything done, go to whoever does a lot of it,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. The good news is that insurance will cover many vein treatments. Without insurance, these treatments can cost $300 to $8,000. “Oftentimes, when it is a deeper vein problem, insurance covers it because it\'s not [just] a cosmetic issue,” Dr. Barba says.\r\n\r\nHow can you prevent spider veins from coming back?\r\n\r\nAlthough effective, all of these surgical treatments are really temporary fixes, Dr. Hollingsworth says. Spider and varicose veins can return in other nearby veins once the original veins are closed off or removed. So, if you decide not to treat them at all, they can multiply, Dr. Hollingsworth says. But if you stay on top of them—which will require repeated treatments every one to two years—you can keep them at bay.\r\n\r\nAfter treatment, one thing you can do to effectively prevent spider veins from returning is to wear compression stockings daily, which can be difficult to get on and uncomfortable to wear. \"Nobody likes wearing them,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. But, “if you wear stockings religiously during the day, they significantly reduce [the chance that] your spider veins [will come] back.” In some cases, your health insurance may actually cover the cost of medical-grade compression stockings, Medline Plus explains, so check with them before buying any.\r\n\r\nUltimately, if you’re dealing with spider veins or varicose veins, it’s important to check in with a doctor or dermatologist. They can help you understand how serious your particular issue is, talk about what may underlying issues may have caused it, and, if necessary, walk you through your treatment options.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:21:21', '2021-05-28 19:21:23', '/resources/images/wps9.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/spider-and-varicose-veins', 0, 0);

You’re probably not imagining it. Not only is it becoming offensively hot and humid this summer, but we’re also wearing masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19—both of which may contribute to acne and other skin issues.\r\n\r\nBreakouts, in particular, have become so common that mask acne has been dubbed “maskne” on the internet. While you can’t ditch the mask, there are steps you can take to prevent and treat mask-related acne to enjoy a safe summer with healthy skin.\r\n\r\nWhat causes mask acne?\r\n\r\nAcne usually develops when pores get clogged by oil, dead skin cells, makeup, dirt, or bacteria. This can lead to blackheads, whiteheads, or pimples that can vary in size and type, depending on how infected they get.\r\n\r\nAdopting a simple skin-care routine—including cleansing, exfoliating, moisturizing, and wearing sunscreen—helps manage acne because it helps with the skin’s natural shedding process. Regular cleansing and exfoliating ensures that all that gunk and dead skin cells are removed rather than clogging your pores. Moisturizing and wearing sunscreen helps ensure the skin’s protective outer layer functions properly.\r\n\r\nBut wearing a face mask can interfere with that process. Instead of those dead skin cells shedding “throughout the day, they now get clogged in your pores,” Carrie L. Kovarik, M.D., an associate professor of dermatology at University of Pennsylvania and a member of the American Association of Dermatology’s (AAD) COVID-19 task force, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nMasks also provide the perfect humid environment for bacteria to grow in our skin, which can lead to a breakout, Noelani Gonzalez, M.D., director of cosmetic dermatology at Mount Sinai, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nHow can you treat mask acne?\r\n\r\nIf you’re dealing with an active mask acne breakout there are ways to treat it—and the methods aren’t so different from the way you’d treat regular acne.\r\n\r\nFor milder cases, classic over-the-counter acne-fighting ingredients like benzoyl peroxide (which kills the bacteria associated with acne) and salicylic acid (a chemical exfoliant that helps unclog pores, should be your go-tos, Dr. Gonzalez says. You can try using a benzoyl peroxide-containing spot treatment, such as Neutrogena On-the-Spot Acne Treatment ($6, Amazon) or La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Acne Treatment ($30, Amazon). And for salicylic acid products, look for gentle acne cleansers, such as Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser ($11, Ulta) or First Aid Beauty Acne Clearing Charcoal Cleanser ($24, Dermstore).\r\n\r\nBut for more severe acne, meaning it’s inflamed or you’re dealing with deep, cystic pimples, a dermatologist might prescribe other treatments such as anti-inflammatory cortisone creams or retinoid medications, which speed up the skin’s natural cell turnover process.\r\n\r\nHowever, both prescription and over-the-counter acne remedies can be irritating, especially if you have sensitive skin or you’re also dealing with raw, red, inflamed areas of skin. In these cases, a dermatologist may recommend you use acne treatments less frequently or hold off on treating the acne altogether until the raw areas of your skin heals. So the right treatment for you may depend on the exact type of problem you develop and your skin type.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve tried over-the-counter options without success, then it’s best to check in with a board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Gonzalez says. Many dermatologists are now offering video consultations as well.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to prevent mask acne?\r\n\r\nSince we’re going to be wearing masks for a while, managing mask acne isn’t going to be a one-time deal. It will require developing both treatment and ongoing prevention habits to keep your skin clear. And, because mask-related acne doesn’t just affect those who tend to be more acne-prone in general, dermatologists recommend that everyone practice good mask-wearing hygiene.\r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nThe first step is to choose a mask that allows your skin (and you) to breathe while also protecting others and yourself from the spread of coronavirus. To accomplish that, the mask should sit snugly but comfortably on your face and should cover both your mouth and nose, SELF explained previously.\r\n\r\n“I recommend soft fabrics, something like cotton or silk,” Dr. Gonzalez says. “They are materials that tend to be more gentle and breathable on the skin, versus synthetic materials that tend to be harsher on the skin.” Here are a few cloth masks to check out as well as recommendations for those looking to work out in a mask.\r\n\r\nAfter choosing a well-fitting mask that doesn’t irritate your skin, it’s time to think about what you put under it. Choosing skin care and makeup products that are labeled non-comedogenic or oil-free underneath the mask can help reduce chances of breakouts. But Dr. Gonzalez suggests avoiding makeup under your mask entirely—especially heavy foundations and multiple layers of products, which can clog pores and lead to acne.\r\n\r\nInstead, wear a moisturizer with at least SPF 30, Dr. Gonzalez says. Not only will this protect your skin from UV rays, but wearing sunscreen can also help prevent other mask-related skin issues, such as tan lines. And the moisturizing helps reduce friction and chafing.\r\n\r\nAfter a long day of wearing your mask, use a gentle cleanser to wash your face to remove all the accumulated debris and oil, Dr. Kovarik says. But dry skin is another common face mask-related skin issue, so make sure to moisturize immediately after washing your face. Kovarik recommends using a moisturizer with ceramides, which help lock moisture into your skin, and/or hyaluronic acid, which has a hydrating effect.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re thinking about adding anything new to your daily skin-care routine, Dr. Gonzalez recommends against starting any new harsh treatments for your skin. Adding products like harsh chemical peels can make the skin more sensitive “and should be avoided because that’ll make your skin more prone to breaking out,” she says.\r\n\r\nHow to wash your mask:\r\n\r\nYour face isn’t the only thing you need to wash! In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend washing cloth masks after each use, which helps remove oils and dead skin that collect inside the mask. To do so, use warm water and a gentle detergent that doesn’t irritate the skin.\r\n\r\nLook for detergents that are free of added colors and fragrances, which are common skin irritants, Dr. Kovarik says. This will ensure that you’re being gentle on sensitive or irritated skin and will reduce the chances of developing a reaction like contact dermatitis.\r\n\r\nAcne isn’t the only mask-related skin issue you might experience.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other skin issues that may arise during the summer of face masks. For instance, you may need to take extra care with your lips to prevent irritation. Unless you have a cone-shaped mask, “the lips are going to be the first thing your mask is going to touch,” Dr. Kovarik says. She recommends using a lip balm or Vaseline ($9 for a pack of 3, Amazon) to protect them.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you have a skin condition like rosacea or eczema, the irritation from face masks may trigger your symptoms. To manage that, definitely keep up the treatment plan that your dermatologist recommended for you, but get in touch with your derm if that plan is no longer enough to manage the flares.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:21:39', '2021-05-28 19:21:37', '/resources/images/wps10.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/mask-acne', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (142, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Back Acne for Good', 'And when to talk to a dermatologist.', '![img](/resources/images/wps11.png) \r\n\r\nFace acne is a common—and frustrating—skin condition to manage. And figuring out how to get rid of back acne is no different. For some people, back acne causes small pimples, while others deal with large cystic acne zits, which can be deep, painful, and pus-filled. And because back acne can be caused by external factors, particularly working out and wearing sweaty clothes, it can be stubborn to treat with the usual acne remedies—even if they work for the pimples on your face.\r\n\r\nSo what actually is back acne? And how can you treat it effectively? Here’s what you need to know about how to get rid of back acne for good.\r\n\r\nWhat causes back acne?\r\n\r\n“Acne is caused by increased oil production, bacteria, pore blockage, and irregular skin cell turnover,” board-certified dermatologist Eric Meinhardt, M.D., tells SELF, and that goes for your face and your back. Sebaceous glands in the skin produce oil, which can collect along with dead skin cells in the pores, plugging them up and giving bacteria a perfect breeding ground, all of which can lead to redness, whiteheads, blackheads, and sometimes infection.\r\n\r\nHormones can play a large role, which is why you might break out more around your period, for instance. And if you’ve noticed that your breakouts pop up in similar places as it does for other family members, that could signal that your acne has a hereditary component, Dr. Meinhardt says.\r\n\r\nWhile the root causes of zits are basically the same in both places, the skin on your face is very different from the skin on your back, which has its upsides and downsides. The skin on the face has more blood supply, Dr. Meinhardt says, which helps acne heal faster and reduces scarring. But the skin on the back is much thicker than the skin on the face (specifically the second layer, called the dermis). That means that the back is more resilient and can handle stronger treatments, scrubs, and exfoliants that would be considered too harsh for the face.\r\n\r\nHowever, not everything that looks like acne on your back is actually acne. For instance, so-called fungal acne tends to appear on the back and chest area and forms uniform red bumps. But traditional acne treatments won’t help manage it at all. So if you’re not sure what your issue really is, get checked out by a professional.\r\n\r\nHow can you treat—and prevent—back acne?\r\n\r\nTreating back acne can be a challenge, but there are some straightforward steps you can take at home that will help manage it, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). Here’s how to get rid of back acne for good:\r\n\r\nLook for benzoyl peroxide. Of all the over-the-counter acne medication options you have, the AAD suggests starting with benzoyl peroxide. This ingredient works by killing bacteria that fuel acne. The AAD recommends using a wash containing benzoyl peroxide by letting it sit on your skin for two to five minutes in the shower daily and then rinsing it off. They also suggest starting with a concentration of 5.3% and only going higher than that if a lower concentration isn’t enough. Although the skin on your back isn’t as sensitive as the skin on your face, high concentrations of benzoyl peroxide can cause side effects, so it’s still smart to start at a lower level and work your way up only if needed.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nPaula’s Choice Clear Extra Strength Daily Skin Clearing Treatment, $19, Amazon\r\n\r\nSLMD BP Body Wash, $35, Target\r\n\r\nPanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash 10%, $11, Target\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nTry a retinoid. Retinoids, particularly adapalene, are another great OTC option for treating acne. They work by speeding up the skin’s natural cell turnover process, which helps unclog pores and resolve acne more quickly. “Retinoids not only treat the acne you have today, they also change the way the cells turn over, reducing your development of acne tomorrow,” Heidi Waldorf, M.D., the director of laser and cosmetic dermatology at the Mount Sinai Hospital, tells SELF. These are especially effective when used alongside benzoyl peroxide, the AAD says. To make sure you don’t miss a spot when applying topical creams and gels, Waldorf recommends using an applicator like the L’applique to help you reach those hard-to-get-to areas.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nDifferin Gel, $15, Amazon\r\n\r\nLa Roche Posay Effaclar Adapalene Gel 0.1%, $30, Amazon\r\n\r\nAcne Free Adapalene Gel 0.1%, $12, Amazon\r\n\r\nSalicylic acid might work too. This classic acne-fighting ingredient works as a chemical exfoliant, breaking down dead skin cells and getting deep into pores to clear them out. It’s a common ingredient in spot treatments, but those might be hard to use on your back. “Salicylic acid is attracted to the oil in the sebaceous glands, and once there, it helps to loosen the sticky cells and oil to clear clogged hair follicles,” Dr. Waldorf says.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nNeutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, $7, Target\r\n\r\nMurad Acne Body Wash, $44, Murad\r\n\r\nDermaologica Clearing Skin Wash, $62, Ulta\r\n\r\nDevelop good workout habits. Working out and sweating can contribute to body acne, so it’s important to be mindful when you’re engaging in those activities. The AAD recommends opting for looser fitting clothes made of sweat-wicking fabric or cotton to avoid sweat accumulating next to your skin. It’s also important to change out of sweaty workout clothes as soon as possible and to wash them after every use.\r\n\r\nBe gentle with your skin. If your skin has acne, it will require a gentle touch. That means using a gentle body wash or cleanser—not a harsh scrub. It also means avoiding the very tempting urge to pick your acne as much as possible.\r\n\r\nWear sunscreen. Sun exposure can actually worsen acne and cause post-acne dark spots to become darker. Although wearing sunscreen is always important, it’s especially important if you’re trying to manage back acne. Look for products that are non-comedogenic and oil-free, which means they won’t contribute to clogged pores.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nEltaMD UV Lotion Broad-Spectrum SPF 30, $36, Dermstore\r\n\r\nHawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch Lotion Sunscreen SPF 50, $19, Amazon\r\n\r\nClinique Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Mineral Sunscreen For Body, $32, Sephora\r\n\r\nAvoid anything that rubs your skin. The friction caused by a backpack or or shoulder bag can worsen acne, especially if you’re also sweaty. If you can, hold your purse in your hand or rest the strap on your arm.\r\n\r\nTake care when washing your hair. The way you wash your hair can have an impact on bacne. While the oils in hair treatments might be good for nourishing your strands, they can be bad news for the skin on your back. That’s why Debbie Palmer, D.O., tells SELF that you should rinse conditioner off to the side instead of letting it run down your back. Also, try waiting until you’ve completed all of your hair treatments before washing your body. That way you can wash off any oily residue, clearing the way for your acne treatments to do their thing.\r\n\r\nWhen should you see a dermatologist for back acne?\r\n\r\nYou can probably treat mild to moderate back acne at home with over-the-counter options. But if your acne is more severe, meaning you have deep, painful cysts, you should see a dermatologist for help. They may prescribe stronger medications, like prescription retinoids, that can help clear your acne.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not sure if your acne is actually acne, you should also see your dermatologist. There are other skin conditions, including “fungal acne,” that can look a lot like regular acne but that require more specialized treatments.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:25:22', '2021-05-28 19:25:23', '/resources/images/wps11.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/how-to-get-rid-of-back-acne', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (143, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Tan Lines—Without Any More Sun Exposure', 'You don\'t need to risk more sun!', '![img](/resources/images/wps12.png)\r\n\r\nWhen you get home from a long day in the sun, your first instinct might be to figure out how to get rid of those tan lines you accidentally picked up. Of course, you were wearing sunscreen and covering up as much as possible, but even those of us most dedicated to sun safety slip up every once in a while—and pay the price in sun damage and annoying tan lines.\r\n\r\nYou might assume that, to even out your skin tone, you need to get back in the sun or into a tanning bed. But that will only expose you to even more sun damage—and there are plenty of ways to get rid of tan lines without that. In fact, as SELF explained previously, tanning is the direct result of UV exposure to the skin. Over time, that kind of UV exposure can lead to more permanent damage to the skin as well as skin cancer, the CDC says.\r\n\r\nSo, while it’s understandable that you’d want to address the cosmetic concerns of tan lines, it’s important not to use intentional tanning—indoor or outdoor—to do that. Below, check out how to get rid of tan lines with a few safer tips. Not only will your skin tone even out, but your skin might also feel smoother, more moisturized, and more nourished after taking on some of these tips.\r\n\r\n1. Wear sunscreen.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to lighten a tan or even out your skin tone, sunscreen is undoubtedly the most important part of your skin-care arsenal. Wearing sunscreen every day—yes, every single day—will help protect you from UV damage and therefore prevent the parts of your skin that are already tan from continuing to get tan.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nLa Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Milk Sunscreen SPF 100 ($25, Amazon)\r\n\r\nCOOLA Mineral Body Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 ($32, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nBanana Boat Simply Protect Sensitive Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50+ ($8, Target)\r\n\r\n2. Gently exfoliate.\r\n\r\nExfoliating your skin helps remove the outer layer of dead skin cells so that the newer, smoother skin cells underneath are revealed. You can do this with a physical exfoliant, like a scrub, or with a chemical exfoliant, a product containing something like glycolic acid or lactic acid. Over time, this will help your tan to fade, and it’s an important step before using a self-tanner, if that’s something you’re interested in. But be careful not to do this too often because exfoliating with products like these can irritate those with dry or sensitive skin.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nGlytone Exfoliating Body Wash ($32, Amazon)\r\n\r\nPaula’s Choice Weightless Body Treatment 2% BHA ($28, Paula’s Choice)\r\n\r\nShea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Skin Renewal Recipe Body Scrub ($11, Ulta)\r\n\r\n3. Moisturize and use self-tanner.\r\n\r\nAfter exfoliating in the shower, dry off well and load your fave moisturizer onto the already tanned areas to help create a barrier for when you apply the self-tanner. Then dip a makeup sponge into a quality self-tanning gel and blend color evenly into the paler skin; hang tight until it feels dry. You can use a self-tanning cream, but I like gel because it\'s easier to apply on smaller areas of skin. Repeat the exfoliate, lotion, tan routine daily until lines aren\'t noticeable.\r\n\r\nLung Cancer: Myth Vs. Fact\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nSt. Tropez Self Tan Purity Bronzing Water Gel ($44, Ulta)\r\n\r\nSOL Body Gradual Sunless Tanning Lotion ($16, Ulta)\r\n\r\nTan Luxe THE BODY Illuminating Self Tan Drops ($59, Sephora)\r\n\r\n4. Use body makeup.\r\n\r\nIf you’d prefer to cover your tan lines, try using body makeup. First, take off any clothes near tan lines to avoid staining your clothes and missing major areas. Then dip your index finger into a matte liquid bronzer or body foundation and tap a thin layer over the pale spots. Give it 15 seconds or so to dry, then reassess. If you need to go darker, add another layer. Once you nail your skin tone, gently sweep a bronzing powder over the entire area to help blend the faux with the glow, and finish with a spritz of makeup setting spray.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nDermablend Leg and Body Makeup ($34, Ulta)\r\n\r\nKKW Beauty Skin Perfecting Body Foundation ($45, Ulta)\r\n\r\nDior Backstage Face & Body Foundation ($40, Sephora)\r\n\r\n5. Try body products with vitamin C.\r\n\r\nIf those methods aren’t enough for you, you can also try using body products containing ingredients like vitamin C and niacinamide, which can help lighten hyperpigmentation. These are ingredients commonly used in skin-care products for the face aimed at reducing hyperpigmentation and just overall evening out skin tone. However, they generally take a few weeks to see a noticeable difference.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nM-61 Vitablast C Body Butter ($24, bluemercury)\r\n\r\nOne Love Organics Vitamin C Body Oil ($58, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nAveeno Positively Radiant Body Lotion ($28, Amazon)\r\n\r\n6. Wait it out.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get rid of tan lines is to just wait for them to naturally fade on their own while avoiding sun exposure as much as possible. In fact, your skin cells are constantly in a state of turning over, meaning the newer cells are pushed to the surface as the older skin cells die and flake off. So it’s estimated that, within about 7 to 10 days, your tan will fade significantly—as long as you’re not reexposing the skin to UV light.\r\n\r\nHow to prevent tan lines in the future:\r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent annoying tan lines in the future is to avoid getting a tan at all. That requires wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 anytime you’re exposed to the sun. But it also means trying to stay in the shade as much as possible, wearing clothing that covers your skin (and maybe even contains extra sun protection), and not spending extended time outdoors when the sun is at its strongest.\r\n\r\nTan lines certainly aren’t the most dangerous effect of sun exposure, but they can be annoying—and a sign that you may need to bump up your sun-safety habits.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:25:57', '2021-05-28 19:25:58', '/resources/images/wps12.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/beauty-how-to-fix-tan-lines', 0, 0);

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to keeping breakouts at a minimum, I have a handful of holy-grail skincare go-tos to help appease my finicky, combination skin. As a person who’s tried to do away with zits since the early days of middle school, I have a pretty clear understanding nowadays of the products that will work for me, from the moment they first touch my face. Since one of my long-term skin goals is to have the flexibility to just wear makeup for funsies instead of out of necessity, locking down an effective skincare routine as a foundation is key.\r\n\r\nAs the foundation of any good skincare routine, cleansing is a must, but finding a good cleanser has been the missing piece of my routine for a while. I typically rotate between a few that do the job, but don’t really check off all the boxes for my skin-care needs, which is why I was so surprised by how instantly I took to Space Wash, the new cleanser from buzzy skin-care brand, Starface.\r\n\r\nI’d become a fast fan of buzzy skin-care brand Starface (which was started by former ELLE beauty editor Julie Schott, who, it must be said, has amazing skin) after discovering how effective their cult-favorite Hydro-Stars were. The stars are the brand’s first- and best-sellers, hydrocolloid pimple patches in the shape of—you guessed it—stars, that make even the act of healing zits look cute, and their first-ever cleanser is similarly well-suited for my combination and acne-prone skin.\r\n\r\nSome cleansers have stung my eyes mid-wash, smelled overly perfumed, or left my skin feeling super tight and uncomfortable, but Space Wash is different—this cleanser truly gets me. Formulated with soothing ingredients like sage leaf and calendula flower extract, as well as white willow bark extract to help exfoliate skin, this cleanser has rewarded me with clarity and smoothness every time I use it. It has a barely-there scent with no added fragrance, feels very gentle on my skin, and doesn’t leave behind a sticky residue once it’s rinsed off. Not to mention, it’s comedogenic, dermatologist-tested, oil-free, and vegan.\r\n\r\nAfter rinsing my face, I squirt a nickel-size amount of the cleanser in one palm, add a hint of water, then rub my hands together to form a light, frothy lather. Space Wash is extra silky when I massage it on my face, and once it’s rinsed off, my skin feels clean but not stripped, a common characteristic of other acne-friendly cleansers I’ve used in the past. Not only is its formula absolutely everything for my skin, but the vibrant Space Wash tube (like all Starface products) is one of the best-looking beauty products on my shelf, and also completely recyclable once I’m done with it, which means it’s better for the environment, too.\r\n\r\nI’m so into this cleanser, that at this rate, I’m at a danger of overdoing it on my face washing routine. But if I do get a little heavy handed, I’m lucky that the product is also pretty affordable at $16 a tube and available for auto-refills, which I have to wager that you’ll want to do.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:26:20', '2021-05-28 19:26:21', '/resources/images/wps13.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/starface-space-wash-cleanser-review', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-cn` VALUES (145, 14, 'This Is Why Your Skin Is All Over the Place Right Now', 'Raise your hand if you’re breaking out!', '![img](/resources/images/wps14.png)\r\n\r\nNow that most of us are spending extra time at home thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, we’ve started to tune in to our skin in a way we didn’t necessarily have time for previously—and some of us aren’t too pleased with what we’re seeing.\r\n\r\nFor some, this time at home has finally allowed us to scale back on all those products, revealing clear skin with—surprise!—a minimalist routine. But others are finding themselves battling breakout after breakout, Carol Cheng, M.D., assistant clinical professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the Acne Procedure Clinic at UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, tells SELF. “I’ve seen it go both ways,” she says, “and I can see a number of reasons why.”\r\n\r\nWhether your skin is getting better these days or…not, here’s what might be behind those changes.\r\n\r\nThere are tons of factors that could be affecting your skin right now—for better or worse.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to remember that some acne triggers aren’t going to change right now, Dr. Cheng says, such as the hormonal influence on skin and acne. But here are a few things that might be making a difference on your skin.\r\n\r\nStress, sleep, diet. People’s skin may respond to things like changes in stress, diet, and sleep in different ways, and we don’t totally understand why, Dr. Cheng says. But if you notice that your skin is behaving badly right now, it makes sense that it might have something to do with these other big changes in your environment and behavior right now.\r\n\r\nUsing fewer skin-care products. “Part of what’s helping people is they are cleaning up their routine,” Mary L. Stevenson, M.D., assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. Not having to go into an office every day is giving us the freedom to cut back on our skin-care regimens and really take the time to be thoughtful about what we’re putting on our face—perhaps we’re even doing it over the course of a morning rather than in 30 seconds before rushing out the door!\r\n\r\nFor some, that minimalism might make them realize they didn’t actually need all those products and that some of them might have even been making their skin break out or irritated. But some of us really do rely on those products to keep our skin calm and clear, Dr. Stevenson says, so taking a break could have a detrimental effect on our skin.\r\n\r\nWorking out at home. If you, like many of us, have gone from working out at your favorite gym or studio class to exclusively working out at home, that could also be having an effect on your skin, Dr. Stevenson says. At home you have time to take off your makeup, you’re not working out in the same room as 25 other sweaty people, and you can clean off all that sweat immediately after you’re done rather than waiting a full subway ride to shower at home. Having that much newfound control over your fitness environment could lead to overall less irritated and less acne-prone skin.\r\n\r\nWearing less makeup. As with skin care, a lot of us are finding that there’s less of a need to wear makeup daily because we’re leaving home so much less often. Personally, outside of the occasional Zoom call, I basically don’t wear any makeup these days, and my skin has been pretty into it. That could be because the products I was wearing are irritating, or it could just be the simple fact of not having an extra layer of stuff on top of my skin helps prevent acne. “The most irritating thing we do is too much,” Dr. Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nSitting in front of screens constantly. Yes, if you are prone to hyperpigmentation, the blue light from your devices might exacerbate that, SELF explained previously. But the bigger risk of sitting idly in front of your laptop, phone, tablet, et cetera for hours on end is that you’re more likely to absent-mindedly pick at or touch your face, Dr. Cheng says, which can contribute to acne and interfere with the skin’s normal healing process.\r\n\r\nWearing face masks. If you’ve been wearing a face mask when in public (which, yes, you should be), you’ve probably noticed how quickly it can get hot and sweaty under there. You may have also noticed that you’re getting acne in the areas of your face that are under the mask. That could be thanks to acne mechanica, Dr. Cheng says, which is caused by something physically trapping that warmth and sweat on your skin.\r\n\r\nTake this opportunity to work on your relationship with your skin.\r\n\r\nOne of the few, tiny silver linings of having this time at home is being able to take the opportunity to more closely monitor your skin and how your products affect it, Dr. Stevenson says. But it’s also important to recognize when you’re paying too much attention to your skin, which can be especially difficult right now if you deal with OCD or a body-focused repetitive disorder that involves skin picking.\r\n\r\nIn general, Dr. Stevenson recommends checking in on your skin at three points during the day: when you wake up, when you get home from work, and before you go to bed. Right now, obviously, many of us don’t get home from work, we just are home and also working. So the blurring of that line can be a little difficult to navigate. It might require you to pick a time when your work day is usually over. Still, try to take those moments—and only those moments—throughout the day to tune in to your skin. And, as SELF explained previously, setting time limits like this is one crucial strategy to managing skin-fueled OCD symptoms.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it’s completely understandable that, with so many changes in our lives, our skin might be going through some changes too. And, for most of us, the changes will be relatively minor and easy to manage with our usual acne- and irritation-fighting strategies. But if your skin changes are causing extra stress or you don’t know what’s causing those changes, it’s worth checking in with a dermatologist about what you can do to deal with them.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:26:40', '2021-05-28 19:26:47', '/resources/images/wps14.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/skin-changes', 0, 0);

Metalowy ręcznik podłogowy i kosz do przechowywania\r\n\r\n![Metal Floor Towel And Storage Basket](/resources/images/16b-farmhouse-storage-ideas-homebnc-v2.jpg)\r\n\r\nJeśli masz kilka ręczników, które musisz przechowywać w domu, będziesz potrzebować czegoś nieco większego niż uchwyt. Metalowy kosz, który może pomieścić kilka ręczników i innych przedmiotów jednocześnie, jest ogólnie dobrym rozwiązaniem, gdy próbujesz znaleźć pomysł na przechowywanie, który dobrze się do tego nadaje. Możesz także zmienić kolor metalu, aby lepiej pasował do ogólnego motywu i schematu kolorów, do którego się wybierasz.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 19:29:09', '2021-03-10 11:27:08', '/resources/images/farmhouse-storage-ideas-featured-homebnc-351x185.jpg', 'https://homebnc.com/best-farmhouse-storage-ideas/', 1, 0);

The holidays are upon us, and if you’re like most of us, you are looking forward to them with equal parts trepidation and joy. Yes, this is the season to spend time with friends and family, but it is also the season your relatives conduct their thinly veiled semi-annual home inspection. Between extra decorations and extra people, your home can start to feel like a hobbit hole. Save your sanity and keep your guest comfortable by taking the time to invest in simple hacks that help you organize your home or apartment now before the holidays arrive.', '﻿## 16 sprytnych i sprytnych pomysłów na organizację każdego pomieszczenia w domu\r\n\r\n![Organization Ideas for Every Space](/resources/images/organization-ideas-for-every-space-pinterest-share-homebnc-v4.jpg)\r\n\r\nTak, zorganizowanie się może być niełatwą propozycją, zwłaszcza jeśli mieszkasz w mniejszym domu lub mieszkaniu. Jednak korzystając z kilku prostych wskazówek, możesz nauczyć się, jak posprzątać bałagan, dorosnąć asa i zmaksymalizować przestrzeń, mając dużo czasu na przycięcie drzewa. Czytaj dalej, aby poznać 16 genialnych pomysłów na organizację, z których nie musisz być Marthą Stewart, aby w pełni wykorzystać.\r\n\r\n## 1. Zmaksymalizuj przestrzeń na półce za pomocą słoików Mason\r\n\r\n![Maximize Shelf Space with Mason Jars](/resources/images/01c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nMateriały biurowe, takie jak pinezki, spinacze do segregatorów i pisaki, z czasem gubią się. Zapobiegaj przesuwaniu się małych i średnich przedmiotów po szufladach biurka, przechowując je w słoikach z masonem. Nie zapomnij nałożyć pokrywki na słoiki, w których znajdują się mniejsze przedmioty, takie jak koraliki i spinacze do papieru.\r\n\r\n## 2. Dokręć obszar pod zlewem za pomocą prętów napinających\r\n\r\n![Tighten Up Under Sink Area with Tension Rods](/resources/images/02c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nObszar pod zlewem to jedno z najtrudniejszych miejsc do utrzymania porządku. Instalując drążek napinający, masz miejsce na powieszenie sprayów czyszczących, dodatkowych ścierek do naczyń i ręczników barowych. Dodaj kilka pojemników do przechowywania butów lub pokrowiec pod prysznic, aby utrzymać porządek w większych butelkach, a będziesz mieć miejsce, w którym nawet twoja teściowa nie może się zarzucić.\r\n\r\n## 3. Różowy Pegboard na narzędzia i nie tylko\r\n\r\n![Pink Pegboard for Tools and More](/resources/images/03c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nZamiast nieporęcznej skrzynki narzędziowej, którą należy ukryć poza zasięgiem wzroku, dlaczego nie użyć tablicy z narzędziami do wyświetlania i przechowywania przedmiotów? Pegboardy są świetne, ponieważ sposób, w jaki możesz wykorzystać ten pomysł organizacyjny, jest nieskończony. Miej klucze w zasięgu wzroku, a narzędzia pod ręką, kupując różne haczyki, które będą towarzyszyć Twojej desce.\r\n\r\n## 4. Przechowywanie nad drzwiami sprawia, że pakowanie prezentów to pestka\r\n\r\n![Over Door Storage Makes Giftwrap a Snap](/resources/images/04c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nLubię dostawać pięknie zapakowane prezenty tak samo jak kolejna dziewczyna, ale nie lubię kupować rolek na rolkach wstążki i papieru, których zużyję tylko w połowie i które zginą lub zostaną zniszczone o tej samej porze w przyszłym roku. Ten hack organizacyjny maksymalizuje przestrzeń w szafie i minimalizuje potencjalne uszkodzenia delikatnego papieru.\r\n\r\n## 5. Druciane kosze posortują wszystko\r\n\r\n![Wire Baskets Get You All Sorted](/resources/images/05c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.jpeg)\r\n\r\nWygląda na to, że w okresie świątecznym otrzymasz dodatkowe okólniki. Utrzymuj porządek na stołach, natychmiast sortując pocztę. Nie musi to być skomplikowany system, w rzeczywistości prostota jest lepsza. Kosze druciane na pocztę wychodzącą, rachunki i kupony to wiele na początek. Wszystko, co nie pasuje do tych kategorii, prawdopodobnie można bezpiecznie wyrzucić!\r\n\r\n## 6. Uporządkuj szuflady na herbatę\r\n\r\n![Keep Drawers Organized to a Tea](/resources/images/06c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nOto fajny hack. Wytnij lub wsuń górną część pudełka z herbatą i przechowuj herbatę w małym plastikowym pojemniku, aby zachować porządek. Możesz zostawić to na blacie lub wsunąć do szuflady kuchennej, aby mieć herbatę pod ręką w miesiącach zimowych, kiedy będziesz robił więcej gorących napojów.\r\n\r\n## 7. Magnetyczne paski do lodówki oszczędzają miejsce\r\n\r\n![Magnetic Refrigerator Strips Save Space](/resources/images/07c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nPomysły na organizację, które maksymalizują przestrzeń w lodówce, są zawsze niezbędne w okresie świątecznym. Zrób więcej miejsca dla Turcji dzięki tym paskom magnetycznym, które pozwalają wieszać butelki po piwie i napojach gazowanych na górnej półce, oszczędzając drzwi lodówki i miejsce na półkach w czasie, gdy przestrzeń jest na wagę złota.\r\n\r\n## 8. Unikaj bałaganu, organizując torby\r\n\r\n![Avoid Clutter by Keeping Bags Organized](/resources/images/08c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nMoże trzymasz się toreb na zakupy, aby ponownie wykorzystać je do mniejszych pojemników na śmieci. Problem polega na tym, że z biegiem czasu kończą na całym moim piętrze lub chowają się w rogach, a ty jesteś sfrustrowany i wyrzucasz je wszystkie. Ta wskazówka pomaga utrzymać porządek i porządek w torbach, jednocześnie utrzymując je w zasięgu wzroku, co ułatwia dostęp.\r\n\r\n## 9. Odpicuj swoją spiżarnię\r\n\r\n![Pimp Your Pantry](/resources/images/09c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nWdrożenie wszystkich tych pomysłów organizacyjnych w życie zajmie trochę czasu, ale warto się postarać, aby wiedzieć, że masz nieskazitelnie zorganizowaną spiżarnię. Czarny samoprzylepny list na szklanych pojemnikach do przechowywania ułatwia odwiedzanie przyjaciół i rodziny, aby wiedzieć, jak odłożyć wszystko na właściwe miejsce.\r\n\r\n## 10. Dodaj nowy obrót na stojakach na przyprawy\r\n\r\n![Put a New Spin on Spice Racks](/resources/images/10c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nRegały na przyprawy zajmują dużo miejsca w szafce i są trudne do utrzymania w porządku. Niektóre z przypraw, których używasz najczęściej, gubią się w tylnej części szafki. To magnetyczne „koło przyprawowe” pozwala zaoszczędzić miejsce i frustrację, zapewniając łatwy dostęp do często używanych składników.\r\n\r\n## 11. Klipsy do segregatorów do małych rozwiązań przestrzennych\r\n\r\n![Binder Clips for Small Space Solutions](/resources/images/11c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.png)\r\n\r\nNaprawdę istnieje milion sposobów wykorzystania spinaczy do segregatorów. Wszystko, czego potrzebujesz, to klips na segregator i haczyk, aby zamienić każdą dostępną powierzchnię w miejsce do przechowywania. Śledź duże paczki z przyprawami po otwarciu, zaciskając je spinaczami i zawieszając w spiżarni lub szafce na przyprawy.\r\n\r\n## 12. Pojemniki Rubbermaid z możliwością układania w stosy sprawiają, że piwnice są piękne\r\n\r\n![Stackable Rubbermaid Bins Keep Basements Beautiful](/resources/images/12c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nZaoszczędź miejsce, pakując letnie ubrania i materiały, takie jak przenośne lodówki i wentylatory. Jeśli masz starą ramę łóżka piętrowego, z łatwością zamieni się ona w miejsce na półkę, na którym możesz układać skrzynie do przechowywania. Jeśli nie, jest to łatwy i niedrogi projekt DIY, który wymaga tylko kilku gwoździ, wiertła, drewna i czasu.\r\n\r\n## 13. Toczące się wózki sprawiają, że rzeczy poruszają się do przodu\r\n\r\n![Rolling Carts Keep Things Moving Forward](/resources/images/13c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nWózki na kółkach to coś więcej niż tylko serwowanie koktajli o tematyce świątecznej. Mogą służyć do przechowywania i sortowania ważnych dokumentów lub materiałów biurowych. Dodając kilka ozdobnych kartonów i składanych pudełek z tkaniny, możesz łatwo zminimalizować bałagan i zamienić prosty wózek na kółkach w biuro na kółkach.\r\n\r\n## 14. Uproszczone środki czyszczące\r\n\r\n![Cleaning Supplies Simplified](/resources/images/14c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nZimowy śnieg i sól drogowa na butach innych ludzi mogą zrujnować podłogę, dlatego przez cały czas musisz mieć przy sobie środki czystości. Zamiast przechowywać środki czystości w wielu pokojach, uprościć i uporządkować, tworząc stację sprzątającą? Paski dowodzenia utrzymują mop, miotłę i szufelkę z dala od drogi, ale nadal są łatwe do znalezienia.\r\n\r\n## 15. Utrzymuj zęby i ręczniki w porządku dzięki stojakowi do organizowania DIY\r\n\r\n![Keep Teeth and Towels Neat with a DIY Organizing Rack](/resources/images/15c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.png)\r\n\r\nJeśli masz dom pełen ludzi, prawdopodobnie masz blat w łazience pełen szczoteczek do zębów, pasty do zębów i maszynek do golenia. Zmień przeznaczenie stojaka na świeczniki, dodając haczyki, których możesz użyć do przechowywania ręczników. Nie możemy zagwarantować, że to powstrzyma dziadka przed pożyczeniem twojej brzytwy, ale zdecydowanie warto spróbować.\r\n\r\n## 16. Zmaksymalizuj przestrzeń w apteczce za pomocą magnesów\r\n\r\n![Maximize Medicine Cabinet Space using Magnets](/resources/images/16c-organization-ideas-for-every-space-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nMagnesy to doskonały sposób na śledzenie łatwo zgubionych przedmiotów, takich jak szpilki, zalotki i pęsety. Dodaj szufladę lub uchwyt z gałką biurka do swojej apteczki, aby śledzić uchwyty na kucyk. Inne drobne przedmioty, takie jak pędzle do makijażu i tubki do tuszu do rzęs, pasują do starych słoików po galarecie.\r\n\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 19:29:48', '2021-03-10 11:28:29', '/resources/images/organization-ideas-for-every-space-featured-homebnc-351x185.jpg', 'https://homebnc.com/best-organization-ideas-for-every-space/', 0, 0);

They are stylish, versatile, and budget-friendly. As do-it-yourself projects go, they’re also rather simple to create and install. Your biggest challenge will be choosing just one DIY pipe shelf idea to stick to!', '﻿## 17 niesamowitych półek na fajki dla majsterkowiczów do organizacji przyjaznej dla budżetu\r\n\r\n![DIY pipe shelves](/resources/images/best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-pinterest-share-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nNa wypadek, gdybyś ostatnio nie angażował się w przestrzeń DIY do dekoracji domu, pozwól nam opowiedzieć o tych perełkach projektowych. Półki na rury DIY wykorzystują metalowe rury i złączki w połączeniu z (zwykle) drewnem do tworzenia regałów. Jednostki te mogą stać na podłodze lub być montowane do sufitu lub ściany. Projekt jest inspirowany przemysłem i wygląda absolutnie idealnie z minimalistycznym wystrojem, boho-chic designem i eklektyczną estetyką, ale można go również wykorzystać w prawie każdym motywie projektowym. Dzieje się tak, ponieważ istnieje tak duża wszechstronność w kolorze i kształcie użytego metalu i drewna.\r\n\r\nJeśli szukasz surowego, kanciastego wyglądu, sprawdź pomysły z czarną fajką i surowym lub ciemnym wykończonym drewnem. Jeśli chcesz bardziej miękkiej, bardziej wyrafinowanej wersji, spójrz na projekty postarzane lub te z bardziej strukturalnymi elementami. Aby uzyskać bardziej kreatywny styl, wypróbuj miedziane rury lub w pełni pomalowane drewniane półki. Możesz naprawdę mieszać i dopasowywać możliwości, aż wymyślisz wygląd, który absolutnie pokochasz.\r\n\r\nPorozmawiajmy o montażu na ścianie, ludzie. Te projekty tworzą niesamowite regały wiszące i pływające. Możesz także zamontować półki na suficie, aby uzyskać wyjątkowy sposób na temat. W przypadku elementów na podłodze możesz użyć łączników rurowych lub zamienić je na koła, aby stworzyć ruchomą jednostkę.\r\n\r\nZastanów się, gdzie chcesz umieścić swoje półki, co planujesz na nich umieścić i jak chcesz, aby wyglądały w kontekście reszty pomieszczenia. Może to ułatwić proces projektowania DIY i zapewnić, że wybierzesz dla siebie idealne półki na rury DIY!\r\n\r\n## 1. Prosta i stylowa półka ścienna na rury\r\n\r\n![Simple and Stylish Pipe Wall Shelf](/resources/images/01-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTa meblościanka do samodzielnego montażu jest prosta, wytrzymała i wygląda niesamowicie. Jeśli chcesz czegoś, co poradzi sobie z większymi obciążeniami, takimi jak te drukarki, to mocowanie do ściany w ten sposób jest świetnym pomysłem. Nie musisz się martwić, że wpadniesz na rzeczy. Kosze plecione to wspaniały pomysł na uporządkowanie drobiazgów w takim regale na rury i drewno. Dodaj kilka czysto dekoracyjnych elementów, aby złagodzić wygląd i uczynić go bardziej przytulnym. Kolejną wspaniałą cechą tego typu projektu jest to, że możesz go ustawić tak szeroko lub tak wysoko, jak potrzebujesz. Możliwości są nieskończone!\r\n\r\n## 2. Minimalistyczne półki z pływającymi prętami ze wspornikami do rur żelaznych\r\n\r\n![Minimalist Floating Bar Shelves with Iron Pipe Brackets](/resources/images/02-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChcesz mieć w domu bar, ale brakuje Ci miejsca? Ten pomysł na pływającą półkę to stylowe rozwiązanie! W rzeczywistości wygląda to tak niesamowicie, że możesz zdecydować się na pomysł pływającej półki z rurami DIY na bar, bez względu na to, jak duży lub mały jest Twój dom. Taki projekt nie może być prostszy. Zapomnij o weekendzie – możesz to zrobić w godzinę! Wszystko czego potrzebujesz to niezbędne rury i wsporniki, bezpieczny uchwyt ścienny i kawałek gotowego drewna. Ułóż szklanki i alkohole na półce i masz sobie bar. Twoje zdrowie!\r\n\r\n## 3. Półki z rurami w kształcie litery L i drewniane półki ścienne\r\n\r\n![L-Bracket Pipe and Wood Wall Shelving](/resources/images/03-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNie jest to do końca pływająca półka, ale daje ten sam efekt, jednocześnie pokazując odrobinę surowego, industrialnego stylu. Korzystanie z rury skonfigurowanej we wsporniku L zapewnia super bezpieczną półkę. Trudno uwierzyć, że coś tak ładnego można zrobić za pomocą kilku fajek i dwóch na cztery, ale oto twój dowód! Możesz bawić się kolorem fajki – wybierając inny metal lub go malując – aby dopasować go do swojego wystroju. Możesz to również pomieszać, wykańczając drewno w inny sposób. Ciemniejsze wykończenie wyglądałoby ciepło i męsko. Wybielanie świetnie wyglądałoby z wystrojem wiejskiego domu.\r\n\r\n## 4. Hip przenośny regał na rury i drewno\r\n\r\n![Hip Portable Pipe and Wood Shelving Unit](/resources/images/04-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO rany, ten ruchomy regał wzbudza zazdrość w projektowaniu! To wspaniały przykład na to, jak (prawie) surowe drewno i meble z rur ocynkowanych mogą doskonale uzupełniać eklektyczny wystrój. Ten konkretny zestaw półek na rury DIY jest szczególnie genialny, ponieważ jest na kółkach! Jeśli chcesz mieć możliwość przenoszenia rzeczy w domu (np. dla gościa przebywającego w pokoju lub w pokoju wielofunkcyjnym), jest to niezwykle łatwe. Po prostu zwiń regał w dowolne miejsce! Możesz go odsunąć, wykorzystać jako przegrodę pokoju lub w mgnieniu oka zamienić go na inny mebel.\r\n\r\n## 5. Ciepłe i przyjazne półki z cyny i drewna\r\n\r\n![Warm and Welcoming Pewter and Wood Shelves](/resources/images/05-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJedną z najlepszych rzeczy na temat półek na rury DIY jest to, że można je dostosować jak żadne inne. Po prostu przytnij kawałki drewna na długość i szerokość, aby pasowały do Twojej przestrzeni życiowej i dopasuj rury. Wystarczy spojrzeć na to urocze rozwiązanie do pływających półek łazienkowych. Łazienki mogą być pełne dziwnych zakamarków, zakamarków i pustych ścian, które mogą wyglądać niezręcznie, gdy są nagie. Dodaj kilka pływających półek i sprytnie zamaskowane dekoracje do przechowywania, aby ożywić przestrzeń.\r\n\r\n## 6. Przemysłowe półki pływające z żelaza i drewna Boho\r\n\r\n![Boho Industrial Iron and Wood Floating Shelves](/resources/images/06-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCzęsto projekt półki na rury DIY jest klasyfikowany jako wystrój „przemysłowy”, ale to nie znaczy, że musisz mieszkać na poddaszu w Nowym Jorku, aby to zadziałało. Tylko spójrz, jak cudownie ta miękka i plisowana ceramika wygląda na industrialnych drewnianych i żelaznych, pływających półkach! Ten szczególny styl może dodać odrobinę nowoczesności do stylu wiejskiego lub shabby chic, który czasami może wyglądać na nieco przestarzały. Prostota i skromność sprawi, że ten wystrój będzie wyglądał bardziej stylowo. Jeśli lubisz minimalizować rzeczy – lub po prostu nie stać Cię na wiele rzeczy – ten motyw dekoracyjny będzie dla Ciebie szczególnie odpowiedni, ponieważ minimalistyczna prostota to nazwa gry industrialnej.\r\n\r\n## 7. Gotowa do pracy w biurze profesjonalna półka na rury zrób to sam\r\n\r\n\r\n![Office-Ready Professional DIY Pipe Shelf Design](/resources/images/07-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNiezależnie od tego, czy Twoje biuro znajduje się w domu, czy w miejscu pracy, ten pomysł na półkę na rury DIY będzie wyglądał profesjonalnie i wykona pracę. Użycie cieńszej rury i zaokrąglenie rogów drewnianych półek dodaje nieco wyrafinowania temu rustykalnemu stylowi. Ciemne wykończenie drewna również świetnie pasuje do profesjonalnego środowiska. Jest to o wiele bardziej atrakcyjny, modny i niepowtarzalny projekt niż regał z płyt wiórowych. Ponieważ półki są odsłonięte, uporządkuj swoje przedmioty za pomocą koszy, końcówek książek i pudełek na czasopisma.\r\n\r\n## 8. Kompletna jednostka ścienna zrób to sam z łączoną rurą i drewnianymi półkami\r\n\r\n![Complete DIY Wall Unit with Jointed Pipe and Wood Shelves](/resources/images/08-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPółka ścienna z drewna i rur może być funkcjonalna i modna. Wystarczy spojrzeć na ten oszałamiający projekt. Prefabrykowany regał tej wielkości z łatwością kosztowałby pięć lub sześć razy więcej niż ta wersja zrób to sam. Prosty, symetryczny wzór stanowi idealne tło dla kolekcji Twoich ulubionych rzeczy. Jest to absolutnie idealne rozwiązanie do pomieszczeń z dużymi, pustymi ścianami, które proszą o efektowny element. Umieść większe kawałki na wyższych półkach, a mniejsze na niższych półkach, aby idealnie zrównoważyć przestrzeń. Gorąca wskazówka: kolorowe szkło dodaje ciekawego koloru i faktury, a jednocześnie wydaje się przestronne i przepuszcza światło.\r\n\r\n## 9. Rustykalne półki z drewna i rur montowane na suficie\r\n\r\n![Rustic Ceiling-Mounted Wood and Pipe Craft Shelves](/resources/images/09-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOdwróć i odwróć! Twórz półki na rury DIY, które wychodzą z sufitu zamiast z podłogi, aby powiększyć przestrzeń roboczą i magazynową. To genialne rozwiązanie dla takiego pokoju rzemieślniczego, biura, pralni, kuchni – każdego pomieszczenia, w którym masz meble na podłodze, potrzebujesz miejsca do przechowywania i masz niewykorzystaną przestrzeń na ścianach. Oprócz użycia drabiny jest to tak proste, jak montaż półek na rury DIY z podłogi. Wygląda niesamowicie i daje bardzo praktyczne rozwiązanie do przechowywania twoich rzeczy.\r\n\r\n## 10. Wspaniały wyświetlacz z wymiarowymi półkami rurowymi od podłogi do sufitu\r\n\r\n![Gorgeous Floor-to-Ceiling Dimensional Pipe Shelving Display](/resources/images/10-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWykaż się kreatywnością w swoim projekcie dzięki temu eleganckiemu rozwiązaniu. Jedną z największych zalet pomysłu na półki na rury DIY jest to, że możesz mieszać i dopasowywać szerokość i wysokość tak, jak chcesz. Taka meblościanka to doskonały przykład. Możesz zaplanować swoje półki tak, aby pomieścić dzieła sztuki lub inne przedmioty dekoracyjne. Posiadanie różnych wysokości półek dodaje również artystycznego wyglądu, który jest mniej użytkowy i bardziej skoncentrowany na projektowaniu. Ten szczególny pokój jest niesamowitym przykładem eklektycznego, artystycznego designu idealnie komponującego się z ciepłym, industrialnym wzornictwem półek na rury.\r\n\r\n## 11. Solidna, niedroga i elegancka półka na fajki\r\n\r\n![Sturdy, Affordable, and Chic Pipe Bookshelf](/resources/images/11-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKonstrukcja półki do samodzielnego montażu jest niezwykle wytrzymała. Możesz bez problemu załadować te półki super ciężkimi przedmiotami, takimi jak kolekcja książek lub płyt. Ta półka jest dowodem na nośność tego wyboru projektu. Jeśli kiedykolwiek marzyłeś o posiadaniu osobistej biblioteki, jest to świetny sposób na jej wyeksponowanie. Posiadanie jednostki do tych bardzo ciężkich przedmiotów najlepiej jest umieścić na podłodze. Prawidłowo zamontowana półka ścienna z rurami również zniesie wiele, ale uchwyt do podłogi to najbezpieczniejszy wybór.\r\n\r\n## 12. Pomysł na transformację rur miedzianych DIY\r\n\r\n![DIY Copper Pipe Transformation Idea](/resources/images/12-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW zależności od projektu domu, możesz zdecydować się na inny odcień metalu na półkach na fajki DIY. Bez problemu można znaleźć fajki w kolorze czarnym, srebrnym lub miedzianym. Różnice cenowe w tych materiałach mogą być znaczne, więc aby zmienić kolory w ograniczonym budżecie, możesz po prostu pomalować rury natryskiem. Wystarczy wziąć do ręki puszkę metalicznej farby w sprayu w wybranym przez siebie kolorze. Spryskaj rury i pozwól im wyschnąć przed ich zamontowaniem. Ponieważ są to ogólnie nieruchome obiekty, nie ma dużego ryzyka odpryskiwania lub zużycia farby.\r\n\r\n## 13. Prosta miedziana rura i pływające półki z białego drewna\r\n\r\n![Simple Copper Pipe and White Wood Floating Shelves](/resources/images/13-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUżycie miedzi zamiast czarnych lub ocynkowanych rur stalowych może całkowicie zmienić wygląd projektu półki na rury DIY. Wygląd jest jaśniejszy i jaśniejszy. Pięknie komponuje się z białymi półkami takimi jak te lub z drewnianymi półkami. Jeśli chcesz uzyskać prawie niewidoczny wygląd, pomaluj półki tak, aby pasowały do ściany, na której są zamontowane. Błyszczące wykończenie ładnie komponuje się również z jasnością miedzianego koloru. Możesz również powiązać miękkie, ciepłe metaliczne przedmioty z przedmiotami, które wystawiasz na półkach, takimi jak wazon w kolorze miedzi i metalowa rama.\r\n\r\n## 14. Ciepłe przemysłowe półki na rury od podłogi do sufitu\r\n\r\n![Warm Industrial Floor-to-Ceiling DIY Pipe Shelves](/resources/images/14-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMożesz sprawić, że sufity będą wyglądały na wyższe i stworzyć atrakcyjną ekspozycję i przestrzeń do przechowywania, przenosząc półkę ścienną na rury od podłogi do sufitu. Pionowe linie tworzą optyczną iluzję wysokości, która naprawdę może otworzyć Twoją przestrzeń. Możesz także podwoić, zmieniając wysokość półek. Dodanie podwójnej wysokiej półki dodaje więcej otwartej przestrzeni i przyczynia się do wizualnego efektu większej wysokości. Dodaj kolekcję pięknych rzeczy, książek i pamiątek, aby stworzyć naprawdę wspaniały projekt. Szykowny, industrialny wygląd naprawdę nadaje się do wyeksponowania eklektycznego wystroju.\r\n\r\n## 15. Ogród wewnętrzny na półkach z rur i drewna\r\n\r\n![Indoor Garden on Shelves Made of Pipe and Wood](/resources/images/15-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSztuka, książki i naczynia to nie jedyne rzeczy, które mogą trafić na Twoje półki. A co powiesz na niektóre rośliny? Po prostu sprawdź ten genialny projekt półki na rury DIY do ogrodu w domu! Półki trzymają rośliny, a światła są zamontowane na dole każdej półki, aby świeciły na powierzchni poniżej. Jest to świetny sposób na hodowanie takich rzeczy jak zioła i mikrozieleń w pomieszczeniach, a nawet na przechowywanie roślin na zewnątrz w miesiącach zimowych. Możesz nawet pomalować oprawy oświetleniowe, aby dopasować je do regału – lub dodać kreatywny projekt.\r\n\r\n## 16. Jasne, ciepłe miedziane rury i mahoniowe półki\r\n\r\n![Bright, Warm Copper Pipe and Mahogany Shelves](/resources/images/16-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo po prostu niesamowite, jak bardzo kolor metalowych rur, które wybierzesz na swoje półki na fajki DIY, może zmienić ich wygląd. Nie wierzysz nam? Wystarczy spojrzeć na ten pomysł na półki z rur miedzianych. Ciepły kolor miedzi niemal wtapia się w kolor drewna. Jest znacznie bardziej miękki niż czarne rury, ale równie funkcjonalny. Użycie drewnianego wykończenia z czerwonawą plamą to świetny pomysł na miedziane rurki. To tylko pokazuje, że odcień drewna lub metalu użyty w tych projektach może radykalnie zmienić wygląd końcowy. Warto również wiedzieć, że jeśli nie jesteś zadowolony ze swojego projektu, możesz go dość łatwo zmienić za pomocą puszki z farbą!\r\n\r\n## 17. Rozwiązanie dla domowego biura do samodzielnego projektowania półek\r\n\r\n![DIY Pipe Shelf Design Home Office Solution](/resources/images/17-best-diy-pipe-shelves-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTen projekt ma niemal antyczny wygląd. Czarna fajka przypomina żeliwo, a w połączeniu z wyblakłym drewnem ma staromodny wygląd w najlepszym tego słowa znaczeniu. Ten styl będzie wyglądał pięknie w bardziej tradycyjnym domu lub w stylu rustykalnym. Jest prosty, elegancki i jednocześnie funkcjonalny. Ten mebel świetnie sprawdza się w domowej przestrzeni biurowej, ale równie dobrze może pomieścić przedmioty w kuchni lub służyć jako stolik nocny.\r\n\r\n## 17 niesamowicie wyglądających półek na fajki DIY na każdą kieszeń\r\n\r\nCóż za niesamowita kolekcja kreatywnych pomysłów na projekt! Aż trudno uwierzyć, że tylko dwa elementy – rura i drewno – mogą stworzyć tak różnorodne style i pomysły. Jeśli nie masz pewności, od czego zacząć, każdy pracownik lokalnego sklepu ze sprzętem lub majsterkowicza może przeprowadzić Cię przez podstawy łączenia rur i osprzętu, aby uzyskać pożądany kształt. Mogą również pomóc w ustaleniu, jakie rodzaje śrub lub innego sprzętu będą potrzebne do przymocowania rur do drewna, a także do ścian lub sufitu, jeśli robisz wersję montowaną.

Ten ładny wzór sprawdza się dobrze w domach, które mają lekki i płynny styl dekoracyjny bez zbytniej struktury i sztywności.

Dzięki bardzo rozsądnym kosztom, możesz zamówić kompletną półkę w takiej postaci, w jakiej jest, a dostaniesz ją w postaci gotowej do przekształcenia. Możesz iść naturalnie i trzymać się pomysłu motyla lub możesz wybrać się na intergalaktykę z motywem Gwiezdnych Wojen.

Proste meble do majsterkowania na narożniki\r\n\r\nJeśli chcesz czegoś czystego i prostego, ta pięciokątna półka jest najlepszym wyborem. Dzięki bardzo wyraźnym wymiarom wymienionym w ich sklepie, możesz łatwo odczytać pomiary ich czterech różnych opcji rozmiaru i sprawdzić, czy będą działać z twoim układem narożników i planami. Prawdopodobnie będziesz potrzebować więcej niż jednego, więc pamiętaj o rozstawieniu i zmierz ich układ na ścianie, aby zobaczyć, jak daleko w górę lub w dół chcesz, aby zaszły. Zwykle trzy lub cztery półki to idealna ilość, aby stworzyć wystarczająco dużo miejsca do przechowywania bez przepełnienia.\r\n\r\n## 18. Steampunk spotyka pływające półki narożne DIY\r\n\r\nProjektowanie pomieszczenia z wyeksponowanymi rurami – nawet jeśli są czysto dekoracyjne, a nie funkcjonalne – stało się modnym sposobem na połączenie industrialnej wytrzymałości z nowoczesnym stylem wnętrz. Dzięki temu zestawowi dopasowanych półek narożnych, gustowne dodanie rurki pod każdą półką podnosi zwykłą drewnianą deskę do czegoś, co jest atrakcyjne wizualnie i całkowicie na miejscu. Para jest swoim lustrzanym odbiciem, z jedną rurą biegnącą w prawo, a drugą w lewo. Możesz też wykazać się kreatywnością w rozmieszczaniu: umieść dwa w tym samym rogu lub kup kilka zestawów, aby ozdobić wszystkie cztery rogi pokoju.\r\n\r\n## 19. Pojedyncza pływająca półka z naturalnego drewna\r\n\r\nInspirowane naturą półki narożne dla majsterkowiczów to świetny sposób na wprowadzenie do domu przestrzeni na zewnątrz. Ten duży kawałek sosny ponderosa jest pięknym akcentem każdego domu lub kabiny. Jest wycięty i wykończony zagłębionym wspornikiem z dziurką od klucza, co oznacza, że ​​wystarczy dodać kilka śrub i będziesz gotowy do skonfigurowania go do wyświetlania. Dzięki bardzo rozsądnej cenie możesz zamówić kilka, aby wypełnić przestrzeń, lub możesz to zrobić w prosty sposób za pomocą tylko jednego. Bez względu na to, ile dostaniesz, ta półka jest wyjątkowa i każdy z pewnością zapyta, gdzie ją znalazłeś.\r\n\r\nJeśli ostatnio oglądałeś Dirty Dancing, wiesz, że nikt nie stawia Baby w kącie. Tego samego nie można jednak powiedzieć o większości przedmiotów w twoim domu. Naprawdę mogą wyglądać całkiem nieźle w kącie, zakładając, że masz odpowiednie miejsce, aby je umieścić. A ponieważ mogą być atrakcyjne i użyteczne stoliki końcowe, nie chcesz zaśmiecać swojego domu stolikami końcowymi w każdym rogu każdego pokoju.\r\n\r\nWejdź na półkę narożną. Dzięki półce narożnej możesz nieco zmienić wygląd pokoju bez zmiany jego wszystkich wnętrzności lub zajmowania nadmiernej ilości miejsca. Opcje na tej liście dają również wyobrażenie o różnorodności regałów. Z pewnością nie jest tak, że wszystkie półki są sobie równe, a niektóre opcje z pewnością będą lepiej pasować do wystroju i estetyki Twojego domu niż inne.\r\n\r\nOczywiście nie ma lepszego sposobu na dopasowanie nowych półek narożnych do swojej estetyki niż samodzielne wykonanie cery. Chociaż opcje na tej liście są do kupienia (i nikt nie będzie cię obwiniał, jeśli pójdziesz tą drogą), możesz również użyć ich jako inspiracji do następnego projektu DIY. Albo zapłać za to, albo zrób to, a potem wystarczy go wyświetlić!\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 19:31:06', '2021-03-10 11:30:03', '/resources/images/best-diy-corner-shelves-design-ideas-featured-homebnc-351x185.jpg', 'https://homebnc.com/best-diy-corner-shelves-design-ideas/', 0, 0);

You may dread opening it because you fear being buried under the mound of everything you have stuffed into it and never being heard from again.', '﻿## 24 pomysły na półki w spiżarni, które zwiększą produktywność w kuchniKitchen\r\n\r\n![Pantry Shelving Ideas](/resources/images/best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-pinterest-share-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSpiżarnie są wypchane różnymi rzeczami, takimi jak żywność w puszkach i pakowana; przekąski; Aromaty, takie jak przyprawy, zioła i octy kuchenne, oleje i wina; małe urządzenia; Książki kucharskie; miski do mieszania; naczynia do pieczenia; drobne przedmioty, takie jak foremki do ciastek i belgijskie gofrownice; serwetki, talerze papierowe i kubki papierowe; a jeśli zlewozmywak nie miał jeszcze swojego miejsca w kuchni, może być wepchnięty również do spiżarni. Jednak spiżarnie nie mają na celu udaremniania nam ilości niezorganizowanych rzeczy, które w nich wkładamy. Spiżarnie mają pomóc nam szybko i łatwo zlokalizować rzeczy, które w nich przechowujemy, abyśmy mogli kontynuować przygotowywanie jedzenia, które chcieliśmy przygotować lub przygotowywanie listy zakupów rzeczy, które musimy kupić.\r\n\r\nKiedy otworzysz spiżarnię, powinieneś być w stanie sięgnąć i złapać to, czego potrzebujesz w ciągu kilku sekund lub zobaczyć, co musisz dodać do swojej listy zakupów za minutę lub dwie. Nie musisz przesuwać rzeczy, aby zobaczyć, co jest za nimi, ani podnosić rzeczy, które spadają na podłogę, gdy sięgasz po coś innego.\r\n\r\nTwoje problemy ze spiżarnią mogą wynikać tylko z dezorganizacji. W takim przypadku pomocne może być użycie koszy lub pojemników do trzymania małych przedmiotów, większych pojemników do przechowywania nieporęcznych przedmiotów, wielopoziomowych półek, aby przedmioty były widoczne, a także systemu etykietowania, aby cała rodzina wiedziała, gdzie wszystko należy.\r\n\r\nZ drugiej strony możesz próbować zbyt wielu rzeczy na półce w swojej spiżarni. W takim przypadku może być konieczne poszukanie sposobów na zwiększenie przestrzeni do przechowywania w spiżarni. Możesz stworzyć więcej miejsca do przechowywania z tyłu drzwi lub na ścianach wokół spiżarni. Możesz także stworzyć więcej miejsca do przechowywania w szafie, szubienicy, w innym miejscu w kuchni lub domu i przenieść niektóre rzeczy, które masz w spiżarni do nowej przestrzeni.\r\n\r\n## 1. Pomysł na organizację spiżarni kontroli produktów i zapasów\r\n\r\n![Product and Inventory Control Pantry Organization Idea](/resources/images/01e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: seevanessacraft.com\r\n\r\nJeśli jesteś jak większość z nas, Twój system organizacji spiżarni prawdopodobnie polega na tym, że masz określone półki przeznaczone na określone rodzaje produktów, a te produkty są prawdopodobnie ułożone według rozmiaru. Przy odrobinie większej organizacji możesz zaoszczędzić czas podczas gotowania lub tworzenia listy zakupów, a także zapewnić lepszą kontrolę zapasów. Ten pomysł na organizację spiżarni zapewnia więcej miejsca do przechowywania dzięki regulowanym półkom na drzwiach, wychwytuje małe przedmioty w wysuwanych pojemnikach i wykorzystuje przezroczyste pojemniki na produkty dostarczane w torebkach, takie jak mąka i cukier. Kanistry eliminują wycieki z podartych worków i pozwalają jednym rzutem oka zobaczyć, co jest nisko.\r\n\r\n## 2. Dodatkowe rozwiązanie z półkami w spiżarni\r\n\r\n![Additional Pantry Space Shelving Solution](/resources/images/02e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpeg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:elevengables.com\r\n\r\nNiezależnie od tego, czy nie masz istniejącej spiżarni, czy potrzebujesz więcej miejsca w spiżarni, pomysły na spiżarnię kuchenną można stworzyć przy użyciu innych półek, takich jak regały na książki. Te dwa regały można było wbudować, wstępnie zmontować regały na książki i dodać drzwi. Przezroczyste słoiki i kosze również pomagają uporządkować przestrzeń spiżarni. Pokazany tutaj dodatkowy pomysł na przechowywanie w spiżarni to plastikowe pojemniki na puszki. Kosze są wykonane z drucianej siatki, która jest niższa z przodu, dzięki czemu można łatwo zobaczyć i wyjąć zawarte w nich przedmioty. Puszki są ułożone na bokach, aby się nie przewróciły.\r\n\r\n## 3. Pomysły na półki w spiżarni w jadalni\r\n\r\n![Pantry Shelving Ideas for the Dining Room](/resources/images/03e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: asavoryfeast.com\r\n\r\nDzięki półszklanym drzwiom dodanym do tego regału Billy z Ikei, możesz umieścić swoją spiżarnię w jadalni. Możesz nawet mieć miejsce na umieszczenie dwóch z nich obok siebie. Ten pomysł na organizację spiżarni nie tylko pomoże Ci przechowywać przedmioty ze spiżarni, ale może również pełnić funkcję kredensu i zapewnić miejsce do przechowywania naczyń, które ładnie będą się prezentować za drzwiami. Półki tego regału są regulowane, co ułatwia przechowywanie wysokich przedmiotów. Dodaj kosze, kosze i przezroczyste słoiki, a stworzysz nową lokalizację dla pomysłu na przechowywanie spiżarni.\r\n\r\n## 4. Używanie elementów organizacyjnych do maksymalizacji przestrzeni dyskowej\r\n\r\n![Using Organizational Items to Maximize Storage Space](/resources/images/04e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: cassandrajed-cassadiva.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nZamiast szklanych kanistrów, ten pomysł na przechowywanie w spiżarni wykorzystuje plastikowe pojemniki do układania w stosy, aby zmniejszyć marnowaną przestrzeń. Umieść większe pojemniki na górnej półce i pociągnij je do przodu, aby mieć do nich łatwy dostęp. Wykorzystaj przestrzeń za tymi pojemnikami do przechowywania przedmiotów, które nie są często używane. Mniejsze pojemniki na następnej półce są odsuwane, ponieważ jest ich tak dużo, że nie chcesz ich przesuwać, aby dostać się do innych przedmiotów. Na kolejnej półce trzypoziomowy regał z miejscem pod folią, folią i workami do przechowywania świetnie wykorzystuje przestrzeń pionową. Wysuwane pojemniki przechowują przedmioty, ale zapewniają łatwy dostęp. Na koniec zawieś małe druciane kosze powlekane plastikiem w dowolnych rozmiarach, jakich potrzebujesz, konserwy, przyprawy i inne przedmioty.\r\n\r\n## 5. Etykietowanie może być kluczem do utrzymania organizacji\r\n\r\n![Labeling Can be Key to Maintaining Organization](/resources/images/05e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: stacygravesinteriors.com\r\n\r\nTen pomysł na organizację spiżarni wykorzystuje przezroczyste plastikowe pojemniki z uchwytami. Kosze mają kwadratowe krawędzie, dzięki czemu leżą obok siebie, nie marnując miejsca. Tylko upewnij się, że zostawiłeś między nimi wystarczająco dużo miejsca, aby można je było łatwo usunąć. Uchwyty pomagają zachować kontrolę nad pojemnikiem. Wielopoziomowy regał zapewnia dostęp do żywności w puszkach. Wiszące kosze pod półką tworzą pionowe przechowywanie bielizny. Jednak najlepszym pomysłem może być oznakowanie pojemników, aby członkowie rodziny wiedzieli, do jakich pojemników należą przedmioty, kiedy już z nimi skończą. Pomaga to w utrzymaniu zorganizowanego projektu spiżarni.\r\n\r\n## 6. Stwórz projekt spiżarni dla szafy\r\n\r\n![Create a Pantry Design for a Closet](/resources/images/06e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:thevintagewren.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nJeśli nie masz spiżarni w swoim domu, możesz skorzystać z pomysłów na półki ze spiżarni wygenerowanych przez ten obraz i stworzyć spiżarnię w szafie, pralni, piwnicy, piwnicy lub garażu. Jedyną ostrożnością przy korzystaniu z niektórych obszarów są obawy dotyczące kontroli temperatury i wilgotności. Obawy te zależą od rodzaju żywności, którą chcesz przechowywać. Nawet towary w puszkach powinny być przechowywane w temperaturze 70° F lub niższej. Jeśli zamierzasz skorzystać z szafy, zmierz jej szerokość i kup wsporniki oraz półki z siatki, drewna lub deski, które zmieszczą się w poprzek szafy. Możesz również wybrać gotowe do montażu regały z siatki lub metalu, które pasują do Twojej przestrzeni.\r\n\r\n## 7. Poszukiwanie mniej intensywnych pomysłów na organizację spiżarni\r\n\r\n![Looking for Less Intensive Pantry Organization Ideas](/resources/images/07e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: crazy-wonderful.com\r\n\r\nJeśli potrzebujesz tylko trochę prostowania w swojej spiżarni, zamiast pełnej reorganizacji z mnóstwem specjalnych pojemników, wypróbuj pomysły z tej spiżarni. Kosze zawierają duże przedmioty, a etykietowanie pomaga Tobie i Twojej rodzinie wiedzieć, gdzie są rzeczy. Regały druciane pomagają stworzyć drugi poziom półek na krótszych przedmiotach. Przenoszenie przypraw do koszy na pustej przestrzeni z tyłu drzwi wykorzystuje tę pionową przestrzeń i oczyszcza zagraconą przestrzeń na półkach, udostępniając ją na inne przedmioty. Ten szybki, tańszy pomysł na spiżarnię kuchenną nadal zapewni lepiej zorganizowaną spiżarnię.\r\n\r\n## 8. Pomysły na spiżarnie kuchenne do tworzenia większych spiżarni\r\n\r\n![Kitchen Pantry Ideas for Creating Larger Pantries](/resources/images/08e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:willscasa.com\r\n\r\nDuża spiżarnia umożliwia przechowywanie artykułów spożywczych i urządzeń w spiżarni, co nie jest możliwe w większości domów. Jeśli chcesz mieć większą spiżarnię, możesz rozważyć przekształcenie garderoby z kuchni, zamknięcie przestrzeni w kuchni lub wykorzystanie przestrzeni pod schodami na drugim piętrze, tak jak robi to ta spiżarnia. W większości domów przestrzeń pod schodami to mała, ciasna pół-wanna dla gości na pierwszym piętrze. Wykorzystanie tej przestrzeni wymagałoby przeniesienia łazienki dla gości do potencjalnie przestronniejszej przestrzeni na pierwszym piętrze. Jeśli naprawdę chcesz mieć większą spiżarnię, rozejrzyj się po domu i rozważ swoje opcje.\r\n\r\n## 9. Rozważ pomysły na niestandardowe półki w spiżarni\r\n\r\n![Consider Custom Pantry Shelving Ideas](/resources/images/09e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: homeonpoplarcreek.com\r\n\r\nW przypadku spiżarni, która naprawdę Ci odpowiada, możesz zaprojektować i zbudować niestandardową spiżarnię lub zlecić jej budowę. Pozwoliłoby to na podzielenie spiżarni na sekcje przeznaczone na określone przedmioty. To zdjęcie pokazuje półkę, która ładnie trzyma mikser. Posiada również miejsce na przechowywanie arkuszy ciastek oraz dwa wysuwane kosze. Pomyśl o przedmiotach, których często używasz, przedmiotach, które trudno zmieścić w szafkach oraz przedmiotach, które leżą na blacie, i zdecyduj, czy dostosowana spiżarnia może poprawić wydajność Twojej kuchni.\r\n\r\n## 10. Sprytne sposoby na zwiększenie przestrzeni dyskowej\r\n\r\n![Clever Ways to Add More Storage Space](/resources/images/10e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:eclecticrecipes.com\r\n\r\nPrzydałaby się ta spiżarnia z półkami po obu stronach, ale w tej spiżarni i na innych zdjęciach po kliknięciu linku źródłowego są pewne pomysły na zwiększenie przestrzeni. Po pierwsze, dodanie tablicy perforowanej do dowolnej przestrzeni na ścianie w spiżarni lub z tyłu drzwi pozwala powiesić przybory, foremki, patelnie lub kosze. Na stronie źródłowej zobaczysz spiżarnię, w której półki znajdują się tylko częściowo, aby można było zainstalować wysuwaną półkę zwiększającą przestrzeń do przechowywania. Innym pomysłem na przechowywanie w spiżarni jest przekształcenie szafki w poszerzoną szafkę na przyprawy. Krótkie półki na przyprawy znajdują się z tyłu, a z przodu wysuwany regał na przyprawy.\r\n\r\n## 11. Kolejna konwersja garderoby za pomocą skrzynek\r\n\r\n![Another Coat Closet Conversion Using Crates](/resources/images/11e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: momhomeguide.com\r\n\r\nTo kolejna garderoba przerobiona na spiżarnię. Mając w całym domu schowek i inne schowki, można było przenosić rzeczy w szafie na ubrania. Ta konwersja została następnie wykonana w mniej kosztowny i bardziej tymczasowy sposób, aby w razie potrzeby można ją było łatwo przekształcić z powrotem w garderobę lub do innego zastosowania. Zamiast kupować i instalować półki lub kupować regały, zmontowano skrzynki, aby stworzyć potrzebne półki. Możesz także wykorzystać przestrzeń na ścianie i niektóre z poprzednich pomysłów organizacyjnych, aby jak najlepiej wykorzystać tę przerobioną spiżarnię w szafie.\r\n\r\n## 12. Przekształcenie głębokiej spiżarni w zawijane półki\r\n\r\n![Converting a Deep Pantry to Wrap-around Shelves](/resources/images/12e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:vickiliston.com\r\n\r\nSpiżarnia z głębokimi półkami, zapewniająca dużo miejsca do przechowywania, stwarza problemy z dostępem i inwentaryzacją produktów z tyłu. Problemy te można rozwiązać, nie tracąc zbyt dużej ilości miejsca do przechowywania, tworząc owijane półki. Zmniejszenie głębokości obecnych półek o połowę umożliwia dodanie półek po obu stronach, dzięki czemu można wejść i uzyskać lepszy widok i dostęp do przedmiotów na półkach. Pozwala również na dotarcie większej ilości światła do przedmiotów z tyłu półek, dzięki czemu nie są one ukryte.\r\n\r\n## 13. Reorganizacja, która przypomina pomysły na spiżarnię kuchenną\r\n\r\n![A Reorganization that Recaps Kitchen Pantry Ideas](/resources/images/13e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:livingletterhome.com\r\n\r\nTa spiżarnia daje możliwość podsumowania wielu pomysłów wykorzystanych w powyższych spiżarniach. Główną zmianą w tej spiżarni było to, że półki z siatki zostały zastąpione półkami drewnianymi. To poważnie tworzy inny stosunek do utrzymywania porządku w spiżarni. Pojemniki do przechowywania zawierają przezroczyste słoiki, które ułatwiają inwentaryzację. Kosze pomagają uporządkować produkty i zmniejszyć bałagan. Zamiast kupować trzypoziomowe półki, możesz zrobić własne drewniane podstopnice, a Leniwa Susan pomaga uzyskać dostęp do przedmiotów. Skrzynie na kółkach pod dolną półką są wyposażone w uchwyty, dzięki którym świetnie sprawdzają się podczas dostępu do cięższych przedmiotów.\r\n\r\n## 14. Wykorzystanie miejsca w szafce do przechowywania przedmiotów w spiżarni\r\n\r\n![Using Cupboard Space for Storing Pantry Items](/resources/images/14e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:crayonsandcravings.com\r\n\r\nCzasami nie masz wyboru, musisz wykorzystać przestrzeń w szafce na rzeczy ze spiżarni, a wtedy porządek jest naprawdę ważny. Korzystanie z jednego rodzaju przezroczystych pojemników, które są przeznaczone do układania w stosy, pozwala najlepiej wykorzystać przestrzeń, pomaga w ekwipunku i utrzymuje świeżość żywności niż opakowanie sklepowe. Kosze pomagają trzymać podobne przedmioty, zapewniają jednolity wygląd i można je wyciągnąć, aby mieć łatwy dostęp do ich zawartości. Ostatnim krokiem jest oznaczenie pojemnika nazwą jego zawartości. Mniejsza dodatkowa etykieta może być używana na wszystkich produktach, aby śledzić datę ważności.\r\n\r\n## 15. Projekt otwartej spiżarni odpowiedni dla szefa kuchni\r\n\r\n![Open Pantry Design Fit for a Chef](/resources/images/15e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:gingerandthehuth.com\r\n\r\nPomysły na półki w spiżarni zwykle nie są wizytówką, ale ten jest i pokazuje, jak zorganizowana spiżarnia może sprawić, że kuchnia będzie bardziej wydajna. Wystarczy na to spojrzeć i wyobraź sobie, że zbierasz to, czego potrzebujesz do przygotowania posiłku. Pierwszym krokiem jest rozważenie, co chcesz umieścić w swojej spiżarni, na przykład Kegorator i kawiarnia. Następnie musisz zdecydować, czy zatrudniasz budowniczego, czy sam go budujesz. Mierzenie, rysowanie planów i obliczanie materiałów i kosztów powinno być wykonywane ostrożnie, aby budowanie spiżarni przebiegało sprawnie. Oczywiście możesz dodać drzwi, ale kto chce to zrobić, gdy spiżarnia jest tak wspaniała.\r\n\r\n## 16. Grupowanie produktów w spiżarni\r\n\r\n![Grouping Products in Your Pantry](/resources/images/16e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: thegoldprojectblog.com\r\n\r\nPlanowanie, w jaki sposób pogrupujesz produkty w swojej spiżarni, powinno być pierwszym krokiem w projekcie projektowania spiżarni. Produkty do pieczenia, przyprawy i produkty papierowe są oczywiste, ale dla łatwiejszego poranka rozważ przechowywanie produktów śniadaniowych razem. Badanie, co trzymasz w swojej spiżarni, jak produkty są ze sobą powiązane oraz jak i kiedy ich używasz, pomoże ci zdecydować, jakich pojemników potrzebujesz, jakich rozmiarów potrzebujesz i ile każdego pojemnika potrzebujesz. Następnie możesz kupować pojemniki przy jednoczesnym obniżeniu kosztów. Twoje pomysły na organizację spiżarni nie muszą dużo kosztować. Ostatecznym kluczem do sukcesu jest etykietowanie pojemników, aby Twoja rodzina wiedziała, dokąd trafia.\r\n\r\n## 17. Domowa wolnostojąca spiżarnia w stylu wiejskim, wykonana na zamówienie\r\n\r\n![Farmhouse-style, Custom-made, Tiny Home Free-standing Pantry](/resources/images/17e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: homestead-honey.com\r\n\r\nPomysły na półki w spiżarni mogą mieć styl i nie być drogie. Ponadto mogą pomieścić wiele przedmiotów i nadal są kompaktowe. Ten regał w spiżarni wygląda jak regał na książki, ale został zbudowany tak, aby pomieścić niedrogie litrowe słoiki do konserw i galonowe słoiki. Aby zaoszczędzić miejsce, osiem półek jest tylko o 1/2 cala wyższych niż słoiki, które mają pomieścić. Jeśli przestrzeń dostępna w twoim domu nie jest tak szeroka, regał spiżarni może być wyższy, ale nie tak szeroki. Drewno użyte do wykonania spiżarni zostało pięknie wykończone ręcznie.\r\n\r\n## 18. Niestandardowe szafki na przekształconą spiżarnię garderoby\r\n\r\n![Custom Cabinets for a Transformed Closet Pantry](/resources/images/18e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: diydesignfanatic.com\r\n\r\nStudiowanie szafy, którą zamierzasz przekształcić w spiżarnię, może dać ci kilka niestandardowych pomysłów na półki w spiżarni. Szafa, która miała zostać przekształcona, była wystarczająco szeroka, aby stworzyć podwójną półkę. Tak więc, zamiast czynić szafki stacjonarne i wbudowane, dolna szafka z jednej strony stała się wózkiem na kółkach, aby można było ją i jej zawartość wysuwać i używać w kuchni. W dolnej połowie po drugiej stronie znajduje się stanowisko kawowe i zainstalowano wygodny wylot. To sprawiło, że niewykorzystana szafa stała się bardzo funkcjonalnym przedłużeniem kuchni.\r\n\r\n## 19. Pomysł na nieparzystą przestrzeń do przechowywania w wiejskiej spiżarni\r\n\r\n![Odd Space to Country Pantry Storage Idea](/resources/images/19c-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v3.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:welivedhappilyeverafter.com\r\n\r\nCzasami starsze domy mogą mieć dziwne otwarte zakamarki oferujące przestrzeń, którą można wykorzystać na wiele sposobów. Jeśli masz taką przestrzeń w pobliżu kuchni, możesz dodać ścianę, zainstalować półki i zaprojektować własną spiżarnię. Możesz mieć półki od podłogi do sufitu. Możesz zainstalować ladę i gniazdka dla niektórych swoich urządzeń. Możesz zamknąć przestrzeń za drzwiami lub pozostawić ją otwartą, aby stworzyć centralny punkt. Możesz zbudować biurko i półki z książkami, na których możesz przeglądać książki kucharskie, przeglądać przepisy online, planować menu i spisywać listę zakupów. Wymyśl spiżarnię z funkcjami, które będą dla Ciebie najlepsze, a następnie stwórz ją.\r\n\r\n## 20. Pomysły na przemodelowane półki w spiżarni\r\n\r\n![Remodeled Pantry Shelving Ideas](/resources/images/20e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: manhattan-nest.com\r\n\r\nJeśli masz starszy dom, który był wielokrotnie przebudowywany, możesz znaleźć dziwne pomieszczenia, które możesz przekształcić w spiżarnię. W tym przypadku klatka schodowa została przeniesiona w ramach jednego z wcześniejszych projektów przebudowy. W miejscu klatki schodowej zbudowano dwie szafy. Aby stworzyć tę spiżarnię, wyburzono ścianę między szafami, tworząc długą, wąską przestrzeń na spiżarnię. Wąskie półki wzdłuż całej przestrzeni sprawiają, że mniejsze przedmioty są widoczne i dostępne, podczas gdy szersze półki na końcu zapewniają miejsce na większe przedmioty, takie jak kuchenka mikrofalowa, pudełka na płatki śniadaniowe, książki kucharskie i inne większe przedmioty. Szuflada pod blatem kuchenki mikrofalowej sprawia, że środki czyszczące są poza zasięgiem wzroku.\r\n\r\n## 21. Pomysły na słodkie i zorganizowane spiżarnie kuchenne\r\n\r\n![Cute and Organized Kitchen Pantry Ideas](/resources/images/21e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:whitelanedecor.com\r\n\r\nTo, że spiżarnia jest pomieszczeniem użytkowym, nie oznacza, że ​​musi być nudne. Możesz użyć naklejek ściennych z dowolnym motywem, który Ci odpowiada, od projektów związanych ze spiżarnią i kuchnią, takich jak owoce, warzywa, makaron lub kubki do kawy, przez fantazyjne kwiaty, motyle i tęcze po dużą, przyklejaną fototapetę, która może przedstawiać kawiarnię, miejska scena uliczna, ogród lub wiejska łąka. Jeśli nie masz oprawy do lampy sufitowej, możesz poprosić elektryka o zainstalowanie okablowania. Następnie możesz dodać lampę wiszącą, która podkreśli motyw Twojej spiżarni. Przymocuj zasilane bateryjnie diody LED do dolnej części niektórych półek, aby uzyskać więcej oświetlenia.\r\n\r\n## 22. Pomysły na duże nowoczesne francuskie półki w spiżarni\r\n\r\nTa większa spiżarnia przenosi dekoracje używane w całym domu do magazynu. W spiżarni znajduje się miejsce na ladę, które można wykorzystać do przygotowywania posiłków lub przechowywania urządzeń. Gniazda umożliwiają korzystanie z drobnego sprzętu AGD w spiżarni. Pod ladą duże schowki, niektóre z półkami w kształcie litery L, które wychodzą za róg, zapewniają miejsce na duże przedmioty. Inne schowki mają regulowane półki. Nad ladą półki sięgają do sufitu, dzięki czemu masz miejsca do przechowywania przedmiotów często używanych, jak i mniej używanych. Lampa sufitowa oświetla przestrzeń.\r\n\r\n## 23. Pomysł na projekt rustykalnej małej szafy\r\n\r\n![Rustic Small Closet Pantry Design Idea](/resources/images/23e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: birgitkerr.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nMożesz mieć spiżarnię, nawet jeśli wszystko, co masz, to szafa na płaszcz o wymiarach 2 1/2 x 3 1/2 stopy. Jeden zestaw półek przechodzi z tyłu na wysokie przedmioty. Regulowane półki po prawej stronie przed innymi półkami wykorzystują tę pionową przestrzeń. Wiszące półki na drzwiach zamieniają więcej pionowej przestrzeni w miejsce do przechowywania. Wysokie, przezroczyste pojemniki z małym nadrukiem na stopy mieszczą przedmioty, które są dostarczane w dużych torbach. Wysuwane szuflady mieszczą małe pakowane przedmioty, takie jak mieszanki i przyprawy. Oznakowane drewniane skrzynie zawierają przedmioty, które możesz chcieć wyciągnąć, aby użyć razem. Wreszcie, Lazy Susan na każdej półce zapewnia dostęp do konserw i innych przedmiotów. Wielopoziomowa Leniwa Susan mogłaby lepiej wykorzystać przestrzeń pionową.\r\n\r\n## 24. Pomysły na spiżarnię w stylu smokingu\r\n\r\n![Tuxedo-Look Kitchen Pantry Ideas](/resources/images/24e-best-pantry-shelving-ideas-designs-homebnc-v5.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: momendeavors.com\r\n\r\nTen pomysł na przechowywanie w spiżarni przenosi smokingowy wygląd wystroju kuchni do spiżarni. Farba tablicowa na zewnętrznej stronie drzwi spiżarni zamienia je w rodzinną tablicę ogłoszeń. Naprzemienne czarno-białe kosze do przechowywania są wyposażone w etykiety na tablicy, które umożliwiają znalezienie i wyjęcie wszystkich potrzebnych rzeczy w każdej kategorii za jednym razem Na przykład jeden kosz zawiera wszystkie przekąski na rodzinny festiwal przekąsek, a inny wszystkie rzeczy do pakowania obiadów szkolnych. Umieszczenie żywności w puszkach na drucianej półce pokrytej tworzywem sztucznym pozostawia miejsce do przechowywania małych przedmiotów pod spodem, podczas gdy wielopoziomowy stojak zapewnia łatwy dostęp do innych produktów w puszkach.\r\n\r\n## 24 pomysły na świeże półki w spiżarni, aby uporządkować gotowany tymianek\r\n\r\nWśród tych spiżarni są pomysły na zapewnienie łatwego dostępu do spiżarni, gdy chcesz z niego korzystać, a także bardzo widocznego, gdy chcesz wiedzieć, jakie zapasy są na wyczerpaniu na liście zakupów.

Podobnie jak w wielu dziedzinach życia, im mniej zagracone, tym bardziej się odprężamy i czujemy swobodniej. Jeśli nie czujesz, że kąpiel jest czynnością relaksującą, rozejrzyj się po prysznicu i zobacz, czy nie ma bałaganu, który powoduje stres. Jeśli zdajesz sobie sprawę, że ten opis pasuje do Twojego domu, zabierz się do pracy, wybierając opcję z tej listy, aby najlepiej przechowywać przedmioty pod prysznicem.\r\n\r\nKolejnym świetnym powodem, dla którego warto zachować porządek pod prysznicem, jest to, że pomaga utrzymać wszystko na swoim miejscu. Jeśli zdajesz sobie sprawę, że twój drogi szampon do salonu wyczerpuje się szybciej niż powinien, być może twój partner po prostu chwyta najbliższą butelkę z wygody, nie zdając sobie sprawy, że myje włosy twoim drogim produktem.

Pojedyncze, czyste czarne linie wyglądają elegancko i nie przyciągają brudu, pleśni ani brudu pod prysznicem. Chociaż wygląda na dość małą, a przestrzeń, którą zajmuje, nie jest duża, są dwie pełne półki, w których można przechowywać wszystkie niezbędne akcesoria pod prysznicem oraz przechowywać je oddzielnie i uporządkować. Wybierz ten wygląd, jeśli masz nowoczesny dom z dość prostym prysznicem i gładkimi ścianami.

Trzypoziomowa wisząca półka w szafie\r\n\r\n![Three-Tier Hanging Closet Shelf](/resources/images/16-best-closet-organizers-to-buy-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSkuteczny system organizerów w szafie ułatwia odłożenie i odnalezienie ubrań. Często bardzo łatwo jest znaleźć sukienkę lub koszulę zapinaną na guziki, ponieważ często wiesza się je pojedynczo w szafach. Jednak znalezienie t-shirtów lub koszulek polo, które często są składane i wsuwane do szuflady, może być trudniejsze. Ta wisząca półka zapewnia schludny i prosty sposób na przechowywanie tych często ukrytych koszul na wystawie i wieszanie ich obok innych ubrań. Tylko pamiętaj, aby zachować porządek i porządek w stosach, abyś mógł zobaczyć, co masz na trzech półkach wielkości koszul.\r\n\r\n## 17. Kostki do przechowywania koszul z zabezpieczeniem przed przepełnieniem\r\n\r\n![Overflow-Proof Shirt Storage Cubes](/resources/images/17-best-closet-organizers-to-buy-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeśli masz szuflady lub półki, na których przechowujesz koszule i swetry, prawdopodobnie wiesz, że czasami mogą wymknąć się spod kontroli. Na półkach koszule mają tendencję do wybrzuszania; w szufladach mają tendencję do przepełniania. Niekoniecznie dzieje się tak dlatego, że masz za dużo ubrań, ale dlatego, że nie są one odpowiednio zabezpieczone. Te niesamowite kostki do przechowywania mają łatwość półek i sprawiają, że są o wiele bardziej funkcjonalne i uporządkowane, co zapewnia wygraną. Dzięki prostemu bocznemu zamkowi błyskawicznemu możesz łatwo wysunąć swoją ulubioną koszulkę bez konieczności grzebania i bałaganu w każdej innej koszuli.\r\n\r\n## 18. Wielozadaniowy wieszak na ubrania z pięcioma otworami\r\n\r\n![Multi-Use Five-Hole Clothing Hanger](/resources/images/18-best-closet-organizers-to-buy-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo małe narzędzie jest jednym z najlepszych organizatorów szaf z ograniczonym budżetem. Jego konstrukcja może wydawać się prosta, ale w praktyce może być spełnieniem marzeń o oszczędności miejsca. Dzięki dwóm sposobom wykorzystania, możesz przechowywać koszule w tradycyjny sposób, wieszając je obok siebie, ale na nieco innym poziomie niż główny drążek, aby ułatwić dostęp. Druga opcja jest znacznie bardziej innowacyjna, ponieważ pozwala powiesić ubrania w pionie, rozsuwając wieszaki o cal, dzięki czemu można uzyskać znacznie więcej miejsca w szafie. Tylko upewnij się, że wiesz, gdzie wieszasz.\r\n\r\n## 19. Wielowymiarowe przezroczyste pojemniki ułatwiające przechowywanie\r\n\r\n![Multi-Sized Clear Containers for Easy Storage](/resources/images/19-best-closet-organizers-to-buy-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCzasami szuflady w szafie mogą być pomocne, ale nie, jeśli są po prostu pełne nieuporządkowanego bałaganu. Przynieś spokój swojej przestrzeni, używając tych małych przezroczystych pojemników, aby umieścić wszystko na swoim miejscu. Wspaniałą rzeczą w używaniu mniejszych pojemników w szufladzie jest to, że możesz użyć ich tyle, ile chcesz i podzielić je na wszystko, o czym tylko pomyślisz. Jeśli nie masz nic przeciwko szukaniu, potrzebujesz tylko kilku, ale jeśli lubisz być super zorganizowany, możesz wypełnić szufladę pudełeczkami, aby wszystko miało dokładnie swoje idealne miejsce.\r\n\r\n## 20. Wiszący stojak na przyprawy nad drzwiami\r\n\r\n![Over-the-Door Hanging Spice Rack](/resources/images/20-best-closet-organizers-to-buy-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSypialnia to nie jedyne pomieszczenie, którego szafie przydałoby się trochę porządku.

Użyj swojej wyobraźni i baw się dobrze, wymyślając wszystkie kreatywne opcje, które zawiera ten stojak.\r\n\r\n## 21. Czysty i prosty stojak na buty z szufladami\r\n\r\n![Clean and Simple Shoe Rack with Drawers](/resources/images/21-best-closet-organizers-to-buy-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNiezbędnym elementem niestandardowej szafy w przedpokoju jest dobry stojak na buty. Jeśli nie chcesz, aby stos brudnego, brudnego obuwia zajmował miejsce w przedpokoju, potrzebujesz dobrego miejsca do ich przechowywania. Ten niesamowity stojak na buty jest idealny do szafy w przedpokoju, a nawet do sypialni. Dzięki dwóm półkom możesz przechowywać buty, ubrania lub akcesoria, a dwie dolne szuflady są jak wisienka na torcie.

Fajny i kompaktowy idealny wiszący organizer na torebki\r\n\r\n![Cool and Compact Perfect Purse Hanging Organizer](/resources/images/22-best-closet-organizers-to-buy-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNajlepsze organizery do szafek na torebki dbają o to, aby torebki nie były zgniecione, aby były widoczne i aby były łatwo dostępne. Ten wiszący organizer do torebek zabiera ciasto. To absolutnie najlepszy sposób na przechowywanie toreb, zwłaszcza jeśli zauważyłeś w nich zagniecenia lub rozdarcia spowodowane zaniedbaniem i rzuceniem na podłogę przez zbyt długi czas. Dzięki ładnym, przestronnym kieszeniom możesz przechowywać wszystko, od małych kopertówek po większe torby dzienne. Nigdy nie trać z oczu swoich ulubionych i nie martw się, że zostaną nadepnięte lub zabrudzone.\r\n\r\n## 23. Nisko wiszący podwójny hak nad drzwiami\r\n\r\n![Low-Hanging Over-the-Door Double Hook](/resources/images/23-best-closet-organizers-to-buy-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProsty, ale wyrafinowany, ten wieszak na ubrania wiszących na drzwiach jest jednym z najlepszych organizatorów szafy ze względu na czysty i łatwy design. Z tym organizatorem nie ma zamieszania i bałaganu. Ponieważ ma tylko dwa haczyki, musisz mądrze wybrać, jakie elementy będziesz powiesić. Dobrym rozwiązaniem jest powieszenie ulubionego płaszcza i torby tak, aby były w tym samym miejscu, gotowe w każdej chwili do wyjścia. Lub rozważ obracanie tego, co tu wisi w zależności od pory roku: zimą ulubiony szal, a latem łatwą torbę na dzień.\r\n\r\n## 24. Unikalny i innowacyjny wieszak oszczędzający miejsce\r\n\r\n![Unique and Innovative Space-Saving Hanger](/resources/images/24-best-closet-organizers-to-buy-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTa meblościanka może wydawać się futurystyczna, ale gdy ją zobaczysz, skorzystasz z okazji, by przenieść się w czasie do przyszłości przechowywania ubrań. Podczas leżenia na płasko ubrania są starannie ułożone na drążku, zachodzące na siebie. Jednak gdy górna belka jest wysunięta, pręt prostuje się równolegle do podłoża i masz standardowy wieszak na ubrania gotowy do przeglądania. Jeśli szukasz sposobów na zaoszczędzenie dużo miejsca bez konieczności całkowitego przerabiania garderoby, jest to świetna opcja, z której będziesz tak szczęśliwy, że wybrałeś.\r\n\r\n## 25. Wysokie dzielniki półek z białego drutu\r\n\r\n![Tall White Wire Shelf Dividers](/resources/images/25-best-closet-organizers-to-buy-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProsty i skuteczny system organizerów w szafie, te druciane barierki stoją wysoko i przyczepiają się do półek, tworząc osobne przegródki na wszystkie Twoje ulubione przedmioty. Nie ma potrzeby stosowania szuflad, gdy masz te niesamowite przekładki.

Oferują również miejsce na dole do wieszania bluzek, pasków lub czegokolwiek innego, co wolisz powiesić na wieszaku.\r\n\r\n## 26. Wyczyść uchwyt na buty wiszący na drzwiach\r\n\r\n![Clear Door Hanging Shoe Holder](/resources/images/26-best-closet-organizers-to-buy-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJedną z najtrudniejszych rzeczy związanych z przechowywaniem czegokolwiek, zwłaszcza odzieży i butów, jest niemożność znalezienia dokładnie tego, czego chcesz, dokładnie wtedy, gdy tego chcesz. Ten sprytny uchwyt na buty rozwiązuje ten problem w prosty i skuteczny sposób, wykorzystując przezroczysty plastik jako podstawowy materiał.

Chociaż takie powiedzenie może mieć lub nie mieć naukowego poparcia, wrażenie bałaganu i dezorganizacji z pewnością nie jest uczuciem, które większość ludzi lubi nosić ze sobą na co dzień. Jeśli twoja szafa wygląda bardziej jak strona „Gdzie jest Waldo” niż system organizacyjny, jeśli w twoich szufladach zaczynają rosnąć blaty na babeczki, ponieważ przez lata były wypchane jak indyki na Święto Dziękczynienia, może nadszedł czas, aby ponownie rozważyć sposób, w jaki Twoje rzeczy zaaranżowane.\r\n\r\nTa lista pomysłów na uporządkowanie szafy nie tylko daje piękny wgląd w to, jak wygląda czysta przestrzeń do przechowywania – jaka wolność! – ale pozwala sobie wyobrazić, jak można samemu stworzyć tak eleganckie przestrzenie. Często nie jest to kwestia nauki o rakietach ani ekstremalnej przebudowy domu, aby Twoje rzeczy zmieściły się w szafie. Zamiast tego chodzi o znalezienie odpowiedniego rozwiązania dla odpowiedniej przestrzeni. A dzięki tym 26 opcjom do porównania, z pewnością trafisz na coś, co będzie wyglądało przystojnie, pasowało do Twojej aranżacji i da ci rzadki dar czystości.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 19:36:24', '2021-03-10 11:34:48', '/resources/images/best-closet-organizers-to-buy-featured-homebnc-351x185.jpg', 'https://homebnc.com/best-closet-organizers-to-buy/', 0, 0);

Bez dobrze zorganizowanej i pozbawionej bałaganu kuchni ważne przedmioty mogą się zagubić, sztućce mogą ulec uszkodzeniu, a przedmioty mogą zacząć mieszać, kiedy naprawdę nie powinny. Wszystko to może łatwo doprowadzić do tego, że to, co powinno być najbardziej ukochanym pokojem w domu, szybko stanie się najbardziej znienawidzonym.\r\n\r\nTa lista, choć oczywiście nie jest wyczerpująca, została stworzona, aby pomóc Ci w zrozumieniu kreatywnej organizacji i rozwiązań, które mogą odpowiadać Twoim konkretnym potrzebom. Zanim zaczniesz przeglądać tę listę, musisz wziąć pod uwagę kilka rzeczy. Czy interesują Cię szafki naścienne, czy wolisz, aby rzeczy pozostały w szafkach? Czy bardziej interesuje Cię wygląd czy użyteczność? Czy masz wymagania dotyczące rozmiaru, o których musisz pamiętać? Ważne jest, aby wiedzieć, że nie każdy przedmiot pasuje do stylu, budżetu lub kuchni każdej osoby. Ta lista zawiera kilka sugestii z różnych kategorii, które pomogą Ci zorientować się, czego chcesz. Mając na uwadze Twoje priorytety, poznajmy świat organizacji kuchni!\r\n\r\n## 1. Regulowany 5-półkowy organizer z metalowej siatki\r\n\r\n![Adjustable 5-shelf Metallic Mesh Organizer](/resources/images/01-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeśli chodzi o organizację bardziej wykorzystywanych pomieszczeń, zwłaszcza kuchni, krzykliwe i dekoracyjne systemy przechowywania mogą początkowo wydawać się kuszące, ale jeśli jesteś osobą, która po prostu chce, aby Twoje rzeczy były widoczne i dostępne, możesz chcieć bardziej utylitarna opcja. Wejdź do tego 5-półkowego metalowego organizera! Oprócz ładnego, eleganckiego czarnego wyglądu, wysokość półek jest regulowana i możesz z wyprzedzeniem zdecydować, czy chcesz mieć kółka.\r\n\r\n## 2. Wiszący organizer na spiżarnię z przezroczystymi kieszeniami\r\n\r\n![Hanging Pantry Organizer with Clear Pockets](/resources/images/02-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKuchnie mają różne kształty i rozmiary, a niektóre z tych iteracji obejmują układy z koszmarnie małą powierzchnią ścian lub podłogi. W takim przypadku ta przezroczysta, wisząca spiżarnia może być idealnym rozwiązaniem. Można go zawiesić nad dowolnymi standardowymi drzwiami i pomaga uwolnić całą cenną powierzchnię podłogi. Przezroczyste kieszenie są świetnym akcentem, ponieważ, jak mówi powiedzenie, „nie z oczu, z głowy”. Czy jest coś gorszego niż bycie w połowie przepisu tylko po to, by wszystko wstrzymać, ponieważ składnik, który był tak pewny, że ukryłeś w spiżarni, okazał się wytworem twojej wyobraźni.\r\n\r\n## 3. Wisząca szafka do przechowywania kosza do przechowywania produktu do kuchni\r\n\r\n![Hanging Cabinet Storage Basket Organizer Product for Kitchen](/resources/images/03-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW wielu naszych domach czai się TA szafka. Znasz ten, o którym mówię; szafka ofiarna, w której zacinamy się w każdym sprzęcie, który kupiłeś, i po prostu nigdy nie zabieramy się do organizowania lub utrzymywania porządku przez długi czas. Jeśli jesteś gotowy pożegnać się z tym wstydem, rozważ zakup tego organizera do przechowywania. Wisi nad drzwiami szafki, a jego dwupoziomowe metalowe półki pozwalają uporządkować wszystkie środki czystości w sposób, który nie przypomina chwiejącej się wieży. Co więcej, może to również znaleźć dom w łazience, aby zapewnić, że akcesoria do wanny i prysznica są zawsze pod ręką.\r\n\r\n## 4. Wiszący uchwyt na narzędzia\r\n\r\n![Hanging Tool Holder](/resources/images/04-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNiezależnie od tego, czy są to miotły, czy kije baseballowe, wszystko, co ma rączkę, może stać się zmorą domowego organizera.

Od aromatów po smaki, czego nie kochać? O tak, zastanawiam się, gdzie umieścić te wszystkie garnki i patelnie, które właśnie wyczyściłeś i wysuszyłeś. Poważnie, jak dotarliśmy do punktu lodówek z obsługą Wi-Fi, ale wciąż utknęliśmy niezręcznie zapychając garnki i patelnie w dowolnym rogu, do którego możemy sięgnąć. Zbuntuj się przeciwko temu losowi dzięki temu stojakowi na patelnię. Może być montowany poziomo lub pionowo i mieści do 5 patelni.

To bardzo szlachetny cel, ale w rzeczywistości większość z tych toreb po prostu ląduje w przypadkowych miejscach w kuchni. Możesz zwalczyć tę ingerencję, używając tego poręcznego uchwytu na torbę na zakupy. Ta inteligentna opcja przechowywania może pomieścić imponujące pięćdziesiąt toreb na zakupy!

Od paczek przypraw do taco po puszki z zupą, każda kuchnia ma te małe przedmioty, które jakimś cudem trafiają w najdziwniejsze miejsca, na zawsze nieużywane. Wykorzystaj w pełni swoje zapasy kuchenne, inwestując w te przezroczyste plastikowe pojemniki do przechowywania w kuchni. Są idealnym rozmiarem do przechowywania puszek i małych pudełek. Najlepsza część? Można je układać w stosy! Połącz to z tym, że plastik jest przezroczysty i masz przepis na doskonałość!\r\n\r\n## 8. Rozszerzalny organizer pod zlew\r\n\r\n![Expandable Under Sink Organizer](/resources/images/08-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrudno jest zorganizować kuchnię bez tysiąca różnych opcji półek. Największą przeszkodą jest wtedy ustalenie, jakie półki pasują do Twojej kuchni. Nierzadko zdarza się znaleźć świetną półkę, ale jest ona albo za duża, albo za mała na to, do czego jest potrzebna. Przeciwstaw się temu złamaniu serca dzięki temu organizerowi pod zlew. Nie tylko te dwa poziomy pozwalają na przechowywanie ton środków czyszczących lub innych przedmiotów, ale półki można w rzeczywistości rozszerzać, dzięki czemu można dostosować półki do dostępnej przestrzeni. Biorąc pod uwagę dziwne konfiguracje, które zlewozmywaki mają tendencję do przyjmowania za zamkniętymi drzwiami szafek, pomocna jest regulacja.\r\n\r\n## 9. Uchwyt i dozownik do plastikowej torby naściennej\r\n\r\n![Wall Mount Plastic Bag Holder and Dispenser](/resources/images/09-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNiektórzy z nas borykają się z tym, co zrobić bez plastikowych toreb, ale szukamy na rynku czegoś bardziej efektownego wizualnie, a może łatwiej dostępnego.

Stojak organizacyjny na folię i folię z tworzywa sztucznego\r\n\r\n![Organization Rack for Plastic Wrap and Foil](/resources/images/11-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIstnieje wiele zszywek kuchennych, a niektóre z bardziej powszechnych to folia aluminiowa, folia foliowa i pergamin. Te przedmioty są niezwykle przydatne, ale problem polega na tym, że wszystkie znajdują się w tych długich kartonowych pudełkach. Niektórzy z nas mają trudności z ustaleniem, gdzie umieścić te rzeczy. Zamiast umieszczać je wszystkie w jednej szufladzie, której można by użyć do czegoś innego, ten regał organizacyjny to świetny sposób na ułożenie wszystkich tych niezwykle długich pudełek. Ten ma trzy poziomy i zawiera około trzech standardowych rolek na każdym poziomie.\r\n\r\n## 12. Plastikowy pojemnik na paczki żywności\r\n\r\n![Plastic Food Packet Bin Caddy](/resources/images/12-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPo ciężkim dniu niewiele rzeczy brzmi przyjemniej niż siedzenie przy filiżance ciepłej herbaty, a może nawet gorącego kakao.

Wieszak na przyprawy do montażu na ścianie\r\n\r\n![Wall Mount Wire Spice Rack](/resources/images/13-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNiektórzy lubią swoje przyprawy schowane w prawie zorganizowanych szufladach, ale są też kucharze domowi, którzy lubią, gdy ich przyprawy pełnią podwójną funkcję jako rustykalny wystrój. Dla tych ludzi ten stojak na przyprawy z drutu do kurczaka to niesamowity sposób na przechowywanie przypraw, wyeliminowanie bałaganu w szafce i nadanie kuchni odrobiny osobowości i uroku. Istnieją cztery poziomy, które można łatwo zamontować bezpośrednio na ścianach kuchni. Możesz również umieścić ten stojak w spiżarniach, jeśli wolisz używać go do przechowywania przypraw zamiast suchych przypraw.\r\n\r\n## 14. Rozszerzalny organizer na sztućce i przybory kuchenne\r\n\r\n![Expandable Cutlery and Utensil Drawer Organizer](/resources/images/14-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWiększość kuchni ma szufladę przeznaczoną na przybory kuchenne, a większość ludzi zaczyna używać tych szuflad z najlepszymi intencjami utrzymania porządku. Większość ludzi w końcu ulega rozproszeniu, a szuflada na przybory w końcu staje się szufladą na drobiazgi, w której znajdują się niektóre przybory. Ten piękny bambusowy organizer do szuflad ma na celu naprawienie tego, dając każdemu sprzętowi swój stały dom. Posiada imponujące siedem sekcji, ale jeśli potrzebujesz więcej, boki można również rozszerzyć, aby pomieścić dłuższe przybory.\r\n\r\n## 15. Przesuwane szuflady na organizery do szafek\r\n\r\n![Sliding Basket Cabinet Organizer Drawers](/resources/images/15-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nDla tych z nas, którzy mają ograniczoną przestrzeń, preferowanym sposobem organizacji są kosze i pudełka. Rozwiązania do układania w stosy są jeszcze lepsze. Największą wadą tego rodzaju organizerów jest rozpakowywanie. Jeśli jesteś osobą, która denerwuje cykl układania i rozkładania w stosy, te dwupoziomowe kosze do szafek przesuwnych są dla Ciebie. Kosze te są wykonane z trwałej metalowej siatki i są wystarczająco duże, aby pomieścić przyprawy, przyprawy lub pojemniki z żywnością. Można je umieścić bezpośrednio w szafkach, ale wyglądają na tyle ładnie, że pasują do bardziej nowoczesnych dekoracji kuchennych bezpośrednio na blacie.\r\n\r\n## 16. Duży organizer na kosz nad szafką\r\n\r\n![Large Over Cabinet Basket Organizer](/resources/images/16-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeski do krojenia są świetne. Patelnie do babeczek i babeczek są fantastyczne. Ale kiedy wszystko jest gotowe i gotowe, aby je odłożyć, gdzie dokładnie powinny się udać? Niektórzy pomysłowi ludzie używają szuflady piekarnika do przechowywania tych przydatnych, nieporęcznych przedmiotów. Dużo lepszym rozwiązaniem jest ten duży organizer koszowy. Można go zawiesić na dowolnej szafce i jest wystarczająco szeroki, aby bezpiecznie przechowywać deski do krojenia i różne inne tace. Masz również możliwość wykorzystania tego rozwiązania do przechowywania jako uchwytu ściennego.\r\n\r\n## 17. Pojemniki organizacyjne lodówki i zamrażarki\r\n\r\n![Refrigerator and Freezer Organization Bins](/resources/images/17-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeśli chodzi o kuchnię, stara dobra lodówka może być zarówno przyjacielem, jak i wrogiem. Utrzymuje wszystkie nasze pyszne potrawy i napoje w przyjemnej i chłodnej temperaturze, ale ponieważ jest tak duży, z tyloma półkami, łatwo stracić orientację, zwłaszcza resztki jedzenia. W końcu, kiedy odkryjesz swój błąd, masz dość poważny błąd na zawieszeniu. Ten zestaw sześciu pojemników ułatwia porządkowanie wszystkiego, od owoców przez napoje po przyprawy. Dzięki tym pojemnikom nie ma szans, aby ponownie stracić orientację w żywności.\r\n\r\n## 18. Stylowy ociekacz do naczyń ze stali chromowanej\r\n\r\n![Stylish Chrome-plated Steel Dish Drainer](/resources/images/18-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPo zakończeniu posiłku i umyciu wszystkich naczyń zawsze możesz spróbować wysuszyć je w tej chwili. Ale jeśli masz inne rzeczy, które wolisz robić, możesz oprzeć się na tej suszarce do naczyń. Wkładasz swoje naczynia do tego ociekacza i pozwalasz grawitacji i parowaniu wykonać większość ciężkiej pracy związanej z suszeniem naczyń za Ciebie. Następnie, kiedy wrócisz później, teraz umyte naczynia mogą zostać zwrócone do równie czystych i uporządkowanych szafek. Może pomieścić do 8 naczyń, a nawet zawiera poręczny, zdejmowany kubek na sztućce, dzięki czemu widelce lub łyżki nie przesuwają się podczas wysychania.\r\n\r\n## 19. Plastikowy organizer na torebki na herbatę\r\n\r\n![Plastic Tea Bag Display Organizer](/resources/images/19-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGłupie jest wszystko, co próbuje stanąć między miłośnikiem herbaty a ulubionym napojem. Niestety, w tej chwili może być trudno znaleźć ten jeden smak, którego pragniesz, zwłaszcza jeśli zgromadziłeś całkiem niezłą kolekcję. Ten organizer na torebki na herbatę zawiera nie tylko 12 przezroczystych, wyjmowanych pojemników, które pomogą Ci uporządkować ulubione herbaty, ale także pełni funkcję bardzo atrakcyjnej gabloty, którą można postawić na blacie lub stole, aby nadać kuchni bardziej przytulny charakter. Wszystkie kosze w tym organizerze można wyjmować, aby pomóc Ci lepiej zarządzać swoją kolekcją.\r\n\r\n## 20. Organizer do montażu na ścianie i drzwiach\r\n\r\n![Wall and Door Mount Wrap Organizer](/resources/images/20-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDla tych z nas, którzy mają wątpliwości co do małych kuchni z mniejszymi powierzchniami do przechowywania, może to być żonglerka, próbując znaleźć miejsca do przechowywania naczyń, sztućców, przypraw i miliona innych rzeczy. Ten organizer do montażu na ścianie lub drzwiach może przynajmniej pomóc w rozwiązaniu problemu, gdzie należy umieścić swoje nieporęczne pudełka na rolki i torby na kanapki. Wykonany jest z grubej stali, a jego imponująca szerokość 3 ” oznacza, że może pomieścić nawet najcięższe torby do zamrażarek. Prosta konstrukcja oznacza również, że może pasować do większości projektów, jeśli zdecydujesz się użyć go jako uchwytu ściennego.\r\n\r\n## 21. Klasyczny duży organizer na sztućce do kuchni\r\n\r\n![Classic Large Silverware Organizer Product for Kitchen](/resources/images/21-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDzięki Internetowi masz mnóstwo opcji przechowywania do wyboru, ale czasami masz ochotę wrócić do podstaw. Ta taca na sztućce to mieszanka starego i nowego. Projekt jest prosty i klasyczny, ale ma kilka nowoczesnych luksusów, takich jak miękka wyściółka i wygodne antypoślizgowe gumowe nóżki, aby upewnić się, że wewnątrz szuflady nie ma niepożądanego przesuwania się i przesuwania. Jest sześć wygodnych przegródek do przechowywania wszystkiego, od widelców po pałeczki.\r\n\r\n## 22. Perforowana stalowa szafka i półki nablatowe\r\n\r\n![Perforated Steel Cabinet and Counter Shelves](/resources/images/22-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrzy tak wielu dostępnych opcjach przechowywania do organizowania wewnątrz szafek, dobrze jest mieć również kilka opcji atrakcyjnej organizacji na blacie. Te piękne półki w ciemnym kolorze są wykonane z bardzo przyciągającej wzrok perforowanej stali. Są bardzo wszechstronne. Można je nie tylko sztaplować, ale ich unikalna konstrukcja pozwala również na łączenie ich w jedną, rozsuwaną półkę. Są to oczywiście również niezwykle przydatne półki wewnątrz szafki, zasadniczo dając dodatkową półkę szafki. Im więcej miejsca, tym weselej!\r\n\r\n## 23. Organizer na przyprawy z uniwersalnymi szufladami\r\n\r\n![Spice Organizer with Universal Drawers](/resources/images/23-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIstnieje wiele organizerów na przyprawy, ale ten jest dla tych, którzy nie są wielkimi fanami ciągłego oglądania butelek o różnych kształtach i kolorach. Dla wielu z nas, bez względu na to, jak zorganizowane są te przyprawy, nadal wyglądają na zagracone! Ten stojak na przyprawy jest świetnym rozwiązaniem tego problemu, ponieważ może pomieścić do 30 standardowych butelek na przyprawy w trzech wysuwanych szufladach. Szuflady można wysunąć, a każda szuflada ma indywidualne przegródki, więc nie ma ryzyka, że butelki będą się o siebie stukać lub toczyć.\r\n\r\n## 24. Minimalistyczne klipsy do chwytaków do butelek z przyprawami\r\n\r\n![Minimalist Spice Bottle Gripper Clip](/resources/images/24-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeśli chodzi o usuwanie bałaganu, niektórzy ludzie martwią się, że odbierane przez nich jednostki magazynowe mogą się powiększać, zamiast minimalizować bałagan, który już mają. Te klipsy do chwytania butelek z przyprawami zapewniają rozwiązanie do przechowywania kolekcji butelek z przyprawami, które nie tylko oszczędza miejsce, ale samo w sobie jest bardzo minimalistyczne w swojej konstrukcji. Klipsy te mocowane są bezpośrednio do wnętrza szafek i, jak sama nazwa wskazuje, zaciskają się wokół butelek, utrzymując je zawieszone na drzwiach szafki. Klipsy są dostępne w kolorze czarnym lub białym i można je odczepić, dzięki czemu można dowolnie porządkować i grupować butelki.\r\n\r\n## 25. Nad zlewem do suszenia\r\n\r\n![Over the Sink Drying Rack](/resources/images/25-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo nad zlewem do suszenia może potencjalnie stanowić rozwiązanie czegoś więcej niż tylko problemu suszenia naczyń. Zawiera haczyki do wieszania przyborów kuchennych, jest miejsce na noże i deski do krojenia. Jest nawet kosz na środki czystości. Wszystko to oprócz dużej powierzchni dostępnej do rzeczywistego suszenia naczyń. Ma dwa poziomy, więc możesz gotować dla małej armii, a następnie suszyć wszystkie te naczynia nad tym samym zlewem, w którym je umyłeś. Choć może wydawać się to nieco nieporęczne, może być właśnie tym, czego potrzebujesz, jeśli często generujesz dużo potraw.\r\n\r\n## 26. Garnek do montażu na ścianie i stojak na patelnie\r\n\r\n![Wall Mount Pot and Pan Rack](/resources/images/26-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWystrój kuchni jest tak szeroki i różnorodny, jak ludzie, którzy z nich korzystają. Niektórzy z nas wolą chować garnki i patelnie w dowolnej dostępnej szafce, ale są też inni, którzy uwielbiają rustykalny wygląd wieszania garnków i patelni jak trofeów. Czemu nie? Te patelnie były drogie! Ten kwadratowy stojak na garnki i patelnie do montażu na ścianie jest nie tylko użyteczny dzięki 8 hakom użytkowym, ale zapewnia również dodatkowy potencjał dekoracyjny, ponieważ haczyki te są przymocowane do kratowanej półki, na której można również przechowywać garnki lub inne ozdoby.\r\n\r\n## 27. Prosty organizer na pokrywki do garnków do kuchni\r\n\r\n![Simple Pot Lid Organizer Product for Kitchen](/resources/images/27-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJedną z pierwszych sztuczek, jakich uczy się każdy organizator kuchni zrób to sam, jest „jeśli może się układać, spróbuj to ułożyć”. Ci sami organizatorzy szybko rozwijają głęboką nienawiść do pokrywek garnków. Te rzeczy są nie tylko zakrzywione, ale mają różne stylizowane uchwyty pośrodku, które uniemożliwiają układanie w stosy. Bez względu na to, jak ostrożnie spróbujesz zbudować swoją wieżę z pokryw, najmniejszy powiew wiatru sprawi, że się zawali. Lepszym sposobem na przechowywanie tych upartych pokrywek jest ten organizer na stojaki. Możesz przechowywać do czterech pokrywek w pozycji pionowej, a metalowe wsporniki oznaczają, że nie muszą na sobie polegać, aby zapewnić stabilność.\r\n\r\n## 28. Dozownik do toreb plastikowych o dużej pojemności\r\n\r\n![Large Capacity Plastic Bag Dispenser](/resources/images/28-best-selling-organizer-products-for-kitchen-on-amazon-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlastikowe torby są dość wszechobecne i ci z nas, którzy dbają o środowisko, zawsze martwią się, że wyrzucą je po jednorazowym użyciu. Ten montowany na ścianie uchwyt na torby na zakupy to świetny sposób na przechowywanie wszystkich dziwnych toreb na zakupy, które zbierasz. Jednak w przeciwieństwie do innych rozwiązań do przechowywania toreb na zakupy, ten jest pokryty otworami dostępowymi, jeśli chcesz nie tylko torby na zakupy, ale bardzo specyficznej torby na zakupy. Pomimo tych wszystkich otworów, ta konstrukcja dozownika pozwala pomieścić dziesiątki plastikowych toreb.\r\n\r\nŚwiat organizacji kuchni jest intrygujący, pełen różnych ciekawych narzędzi, które pomogą Ci w tym. Ta lista była tylko próbką 28 najpopularniejszych organizerów kuchennych dostępnych obecnie na rynku. Wiele z tych przedmiotów było montowanych na ścianie, a inne znajdowały się nad szafką. Do wyboru było wiele rodzajów materiałów i wykończeń. Co ważniejsze, istniała różna skala między formą a funkcją.\r\n\r\n## 28 najlepiej sprzedających się produktów organizera do kuchni, które pasują do każdego stylu\r\n\r\nChociaż ta lista nie jest najbardziej obszerną listą na świecie, każdy element na tej liście oferuje coś nowego i przyciągającego wzrok, więc bez względu na Twój unikalny styl, na tej liście każdy znajdzie coś dla siebie!

Bez odpowiedniej metody przechowywania przestrzeń biurowa może szybko stać się zagracona i zacząć tracić swój kształt. Posiadanie zajętego biurka jest nie tylko estetycznie brzydkie, ale i niewygodne. Jeśli ciągle leżą papiery i inne rzeczy, może być trudno się skupić i wykonać wystarczającą ilość pracy.\r\n\r\n**Utrzymanie odpowiedniej przestrzeni biurowej ma również znaczenie dla prowadzenia ksiąg rachunkowych, co pozwala na uporządkowanie wszystkich dokumentów. Jeśli chcesz odnieść sukces w biznesie, musisz mieć wszystkie dokumenty w jednym miejscu!**\r\n\r\nJednak organizacja biurka to znacznie więcej niż zwykłe przechowywanie dokumentów. Na przykład wiele produktów dostępnych na rynku jest specjalnie ukierunkowanych na utrzymanie porządku w Twoim biurze, zapewniając projekt, który pozwala podzielić przestrzeń roboczą. Kiedy masz biurko, które zawiera miejsce przeznaczone specjalnie na komputer, jedno na foldery, a drugie na szufladę, możesz trzymać się bardziej efektywnego harmonogramu.\r\n\r\nAby pomóc Ci poruszać się po ogromnym świecie online w poszukiwaniu pomysłów na przechowywanie na biurku, spędziliśmy czas przeszukując Internet, aby dostarczyć Ci nasze ulubione produkty. Przekażemy Ci szczegółowe sugestie dotyczące 30 najważniejszych pomysłów w branży, aby następnym razem, gdy będziesz chciał przeprojektować swoją przestrzeń biurową, będziesz wiedział, od czego zacząć.\r\n\r\n## 1. Eleganckie i użyteczne spersonalizowane skórzane łapacze\r\n\r\nJeśli jesteś osobą, która pracuje w domu, warto dopasować przestrzeń biurową do reszty domu. Dlatego uwielbiamy te skórzane torby, które pozwalają łatwo organizować dokumenty i materiały biurowe, a jednocześnie pasują do ogólnego stylu Twojego domu.\r\n\r\nJeśli chcesz mieć dodatkowe poczucie wyjątkowości, możesz nawet spersonalizować każdy catchall, aby mieć na nim nazwy lub kategorie przedmiotów! Jeśli dzielisz przestrzeń biurową z innymi osobami, może to być również dobry sposób na śledzenie rzeczy każdej osoby.\r\n\r\n## 2. Rustykalne i naturalne ręcznie wykonane biurko\r\n\r\nDla wielu osób posiadanie minimalistycznego biurka może być świetnym sposobem na uporządkowanie rzeczy. Zamiast mieć różne przedziały, które są zawsze zatłoczone i zdezorganizowane, minimalistyczne projekty zmuszają Cię do skonfrontowania się ze stanem obecnego systemu organizacji.\r\n\r\nTo rustykalne biurko jest wykonane z drewna i jest idealne dla osób, które chcą bardziej naturalnego wyglądu swojej przestrzeni biurowej. Ten produkt jest również idealny dla tych, którzy zajmują się twórczą pracą, taką jak pisanie lub inżynieria, ponieważ samo biurko zapewnia dużo miejsca do wykorzystania!\r\n\r\n## 3. Wydajne i użytkowe pomysły na przechowywanie na biurku\r\n\r\nJednym z najtrudniejszych elementów organizacji biurka jest utrzymywanie w porządku wszystkich mniejszych materiałów, których używasz. Umieszczenie wszystkich dokumentów w jednym miejscu może być łatwe, ale jeśli ciągle podnosisz i odkładasz ołówki i długopisy, gdzie je kładziesz?\r\n\r\nTen organizer na biurko pomaga rozwiązać ten problem, zapewniając osłonę na klawiaturę, która wygląda jak taca na lunch. Na tablicy znajdują się lekko wcięte sekcje, które zapewniają miejsce na każdy element biurowy, co pozwala zachować dostęp do najważniejszych elementów przepływu pracy.\r\n\r\n## 4. Minimalistyczne i kompaktowe biurko Steinbeck z twardego drewna\r\n\r\nChociaż duże i szczegółowe biurka mogą być pomocne dla niektórych osób, inne uważają je za przytłaczające ze względu na dużą liczbę opcji, które zapewniają. Mniejsze biurko może być pomocne w powstrzymywaniu myśli i zmuszaniu do utrzymania pewnego poziomu kontroli nad organizacją, wywierając presję nawet na niektórych najbardziej nieobliczalnych pracowników, aby stali się bardziej zrównoważeni.\r\n\r\nWłaśnie dlatego doceniamy, jak kompaktowy jest ten produkt — naprawdę pozwala na utrzymanie pracy, którą wykonujesz w określonej przestrzeni. Oprócz tych korzyści, to biurko jest wykonane z niezwykle trwałego i wspaniałego amerykańskiego drewna twardego.\r\n\r\n## 5. Wydajny i inspirujący uchwyt na ołówki\r\n\r\nPosiadanie miejsca na ołówki i inne akcesoria biurowe jest niezbędne dla każdego, kto pracuje z wieloma rodzajami akcesoriów jednocześnie. Jeśli jesteś osobą, która pracuje w dowolnej dziedzinie kreatywnej, która wymaga dostępu do szerokiej gamy różnych kolorowych ołówków i długopisów, powinieneś mieć jeden z tych produktów.\r\n\r\nKolejną zaletą tego produktu jest to, że każda wersja może zawierać spersonalizowaną wycenę wydrukowaną z przodu. Dzięki temu uchwytowi na ołówki zawsze możesz się inspirować!\r\n\r\n## 6. Nowoczesne skórzane wiszące urządzenia do przechowywania plików\r\n\r\nOsoby zainteresowane współczesnym projektowaniem domów powinny skupić się na tym, aby nie zaśmiecać zbytnio swojej przestrzeni biurowej. Korzystanie ze ścian i otaczających obszarów może być świetnym sposobem na pozostawienie miejsca na podłodze w pokoju, dzięki czemu te nowoczesne skórzane szafki wiszące na akta idealnie nadają się do minimalistycznego stylu.\r\n\r\nProdukty te z łatwością pasują do każdego rozmiaru teczki, a także są dostępne w różnych kolorach stonowanej skóry, dzięki czemu możesz dopasować je do innych rodzajów produktów w swojej przestrzeni biurowej!\r\n\r\n## 7. Praktyczny uchwyt na wizytówki na ołówek\r\n\r\nJeśli zdarzy ci się rozdawać wizytówki przy biurku, ważne jest, aby mieć jakiś uchwyt na wizytówki, aby proces był intuicyjny. W końcu konieczność sięgnięcia do szuflady po wizytówki jest jak amatorski ruch!\r\n\r\nTen wizytownik nie tylko pozwala na wypełnienie go dużą ilością wizytówek, ale także jest wyposażony w kubek z ołówkiem! Istnieje również kilka różnych kolorów dla tych, którzy chcą spersonalizować każdy element swojej przestrzeni biurowej. Jednak bez względu na preferowany kolor, polecamy ten produkt każdej osobie, która chce stworzyć bardziej kompaktową przestrzeń na swoje przybory biurowe.\r\n\r\n## 8. Kreatywne pomysły na przechowywanie biurek z drewna o strukturze plastra miodu\r\n\r\nNatura może zawierać jedne z najpiękniejszych projektów, odsłaniając geometryczne kształty, które mogą być równie użyteczne, co piękne. Te uchwyty na biurko o strukturze plastra miodu są doskonałym przykładem tego, jak piękno natury może być wykorzystywane do inspirowania organizacji, przy czym każdy kawałek plastra miodu jest używany do innego celu.\r\n\r\nRóżne rodzaje plastra miodu są dostosowane do konkretnych materiałów biurowych, ale możliwe jest również dostosowanie zamówienia, dzięki czemu otrzymasz tylko to, czego chcesz użyć. Ten produkt z pewnością doda kreatywności Twojej przestrzeni biurowej i zachwyci innych, którzy lubią fantazyjne projekty!\r\n\r\n## 9. Retro i fantazyjne białe biurko\r\n\r\nJeśli jesteś kimś, kto ceni architekturę i wystrój domu z lat 50., musisz zaopatrzyć się w to biurko. Ma niesamowicie wyrafinowaną i retro estetykę, która zapewnia idealną równowagę między historią a kapryśną. Nogi tego biurka są spiczaste i łatwe do ustawienia, bez względu na to, jak chropowata jest powierzchnia, podczas gdy właściwa powierzchnia biurka ma zaskakująco dużo miejsca na wszystko, co chcesz na nim położyć!\r\n\r\nW zestawie znajdują się również trzy szuflady dla tych, którzy potrzebują niewiele miejsca na swoje dokumenty. Jeśli prowadzisz małe biuro biznesowe, to jest to biurko dla Ciebie.\r\n\r\n## 10. Wydajna i kompaktowa uniwersalna stacja dokująca\r\n\r\nPo przybyciu do biura, gdzie umieszczasz swoje niezbędne przedmioty? Jeśli nie używasz jeszcze jakiegoś typu stacji dokującej, powinieneś naprawdę rozważyć włączenie jednego z tych wyjątkowych przedmiotów biurowych do miejsca na biurku. Na przykład ta uniwersalna stacja dokująca ma miejsce na naładowanie telefonu, odłożenie portfela, pozostawienie wizytówek, a nawet zdejmowanie zegarków!\r\n\r\nDzięki uniwersalnej stacji dokującej możesz mieć pewność, że wszystkie cenne przedmioty znajdują się poza Twoimi kieszeniami i są w zasięgu ręki. Jest też miejsce na długopisy, aby upewnić się, że żaden z twoich fantazyjnych długopisów nie pęknie ani nie przecieknie podczas przechowywania w kieszeniach.\r\n\r\n## 11. Solidne i trwałe biurko z drewna i stali\r\n\r\nPosiadanie dobrze wyglądającego biurka to jedno, ale skuteczne może być również nadanie priorytetu kupowaniu trwałego produktu. Jeśli chcesz uzyskać dobry stosunek jakości do ceny, a jednocześnie mieć biurko, które wykona swoją pracę, powinieneś przyjrzeć się temu produktowi. Sama powierzchnia biurka jest piękna i wykonana z wysokiej jakości drewna, które zapewnia dużo miejsca.\r\n\r\nJednak najbardziej unikalną częścią tego produktu jest stalowa rama, która pełni rolę głównej konstrukcji nośnej oraz nóg biurka. Zarówno powierzchnia, jak i rama sprawiają, że ten produkt jest jednym z najbardziej unikalnych biurek na rynku, zapewniając wystarczający komfort, piękno i trwałość, abyś nie musiał w najbliższym czasie dostosowywać konfiguracji.\r\n\r\n## 12. Nowoczesne i eleganckie biurko komputerowe\r\n\r\n![Modern and Elegant Computer Writing Desk](/resources/images/12-best-office-desk-storage-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDla wielu osób projektowanie domu może wydawać się dużym kompromisem. Jednak nie musi tak być! W rzeczywistości jest to całkowicie możliwe, aby projekt biura domowego pozwalał mieć biurko, którego potrzebujesz, boczną przestrzeń na akcesoria, a także szufladę do przechowywania dokumentów.\r\n\r\nTo biurko FURINNO nie pozwala czuć się ograniczonym, ponieważ zapewnia wszystkie wyżej wymienione elementy, zapewniając przestrzeń biurową, która jest zarówno kompaktowa, jak i szczegółowa. Bardzo podoba nam się również to, że ten produkt ma design nawiązujący do kubizmu, dzięki czemu jest idealny dla każdej osoby, która jest fanem sztuki współczesnej.\r\n\r\n## 13. Przestronne i współczesne biurko w kształcie litery L\r\n\r\n![Spacious and Contemporary L-Shaped Desk](/resources/images/13-best-office-desk-storage-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeśli jesteś podobny do nas, doceniasz miejsce na biurku, które ma dużo miejsca zarówno na górze, jak i pod nim. Ten produkt ma dość wyjątkowy kształt w kształcie litery L, który pozwala szybko zmieniać miejsca i zmieniać ostrość.\r\n\r\nJeśli zastanawiasz się nad zakupem tego biurka, zalecamy sparowanie go z obrotowym krzesłem biurowym, aby móc łatwo zmieniać pozycję podczas pracy nad różnymi produktami w tym samym czasie. Jednak najlepszą cechą konstrukcyjną tego biurka jest to, że nie ma nóg po stronie, na której siedzi użytkownik, co pozwala na swobodne poruszanie nogami bez kolizji z częściami ramy.\r\n\r\nSama powierzchnia biurka nieco zbyt łatwo ulega zarysowaniom jak na nasz gust, ale cały produkt jest bardzo wytrzymały. Na końcu każdej nogi biurka znajdują się również wspaniałe ograniczniki, aby nie uszkodzić podłogi metalową ramą.\r\n\r\n## 14. Eleganckie nowoczesne biurko narożne Walker Edison\r\n\r\n![Sleek Walker Edison Modern Corner Desk](/resources/images/14-best-office-desk-storage-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPodobnie jak poprzedni produkt z naszej listy, to biurko ma konstrukcję w kształcie litery L, która pozwala szybko przełączać się z jednego zadania na drugie. Jednak ten jest bardziej nastawiony na osoby pracujące z technologią, dając wystarczająco dużo miejsca, aby użyć kilku komputerów do celów kodowania.\r\n\r\nChociaż możesz wykazać się kreatywnością i przeprowadzić burzę mózgów na inne sposoby korzystania z tego biurka, dołączona szuflada jest przeznaczona do trzymania klawiatury. Biorąc to pod uwagę, uważamy, że jest to idealne biurko dla kogoś, kto zarabia na życie kodowaniem lub projektowaniem graficznym!\r\n\r\n## 15. Minimalne i duże biurko\r\n\r\n![Minimal and Large Office Desk](/resources/images/15-best-office-desk-storage-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo, czy ten produkt jest rzeczywiście przydatny dla twoich potrzeb, zależy od tego, jak zamierzasz pracować. W zestawie nie ma szuflad, co oznacza, że musisz zakupić osobne metody organizacyjne, aby upewnić się, że wszystko jest na swoim miejscu. Jeśli jednak po prostu szukasz miejsca do pracy nad swoją powieścią, możesz łatwo dopasować komputer i miejsce na materiał źródłowy.\r\n\r\nProjekt tego biurka jest również dość elegancki, z jasnym odcieniem drewna, który będzie pasował do innych żywych kolorów. To z pewnością pomoże ci utrzymać dobry nastrój bez względu na to, jaki masz dzień pracy!\r\n\r\n## 16. Proste i użyteczne przechowywanie na biurku z siatki\r\n\r\n![Simple and Utilitarian Mesh Office Desk Storage](/resources/images/16-best-office-desk-storage-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNie jest tajemnicą, że niektóre z najlepszych pomysłów na biurko i przechowywanie wyglądają dość prosto. Jeśli jesteś osobą, która przedkłada organizację nad jedność estetyczną, może to być produkt dla Ciebie. Kompaktowy charakter tego organizera pozwala z łatwością zmieścić foldery, książki i materiały biurowe w różnych przegródkach i szufladach.\r\n\r\nSiatkowa konstrukcja sprawia, że każda sekcja jest dobrze widoczna z biurka, dzięki czemu nie musisz otwierać wielu szuflad, aby znaleźć to, czego szukasz. Jasne, to podstawowy projekt, ale czasami mniej znaczy naprawdę więcej!\r\n\r\n## 17. Wszechstronny i elegancki stojak do przechowywania organizera\r\n\r\n![Versatile and Elegant Organizer Storage Rack](/resources/images/17-best-office-desk-storage-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDla tych, którzy mają duże kolekcje książek, znalezienie odpowiedniej półki na książki jest często niezbędne. Ten regał do przechowywania jest wyjątkowy w tym sensie, że może pełnić funkcję świetnej półki na książki, a jednocześnie idealnie nadaje się do innych elementów atmosferycznych.\r\n\r\nNa przykład na półkach równie łatwo zmieszczą się kubki na ołówki i zegary, dzięki czemu na biurku można wyeksponować wszystko, co ma związek z praktyką biznesową. Jeśli kiedykolwiek odwiedzisz Twoje biuro, będziesz mógł pokazać im, co jest dla Ciebie najważniejsze, jednocześnie mając łatwy dostęp do potrzebnych Ci rzeczy.\r\n\r\n## 18. Przemysłowe i praktyczne biurko narożne\r\n\r\n![Industrial and Practical Corner Desk](/resources/images/18-best-office-desk-storage-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPodobnie jak niektóre z najbardziej wydajnych biurek na naszej liście, ten produkt ma konstrukcję w kształcie litery L, która umożliwia przełączanie się między różnymi zadaniami bez konieczności reorganizacji biurka. Jednak czymś, co wyróżnia to biurko spośród innych, jest to, że ma niesamowite szuflady, w których jest dużo miejsca na foldery i inne przedmioty.\r\n\r\nIstnieją nawet inne półki, na których możesz umieścić takie rzeczy, jak książki i rośliny! Jest to zdecydowanie jedno z najlepszych biurek, które pozwala zachować wydajność, mając wszystko w zasięgu. Jedynym negatywnym czynnikiem jest to, że kolory mogą być nieco mdłe, ale nie powinno to mieć znaczenia, jeśli szukasz głównie czegoś do pracy.\r\n\r\n## 19. Eleganckie i nowoczesne biurko w kształcie litery L\r\n\r\n![Sleek and Modern L-Shaped Desk](/resources/images/19-best-office-desk-storage-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeśli szukasz biurka w kształcie litery L, które dobrze wygląda, a także jest wygodne, powinieneś zainwestować w ten produkt. Wykończenie w kolorze ciemnej wiśni jest wspaniałe, a konstrukcja jest wydajna, co pozwala zmieścić na biurku tyle rzeczy, których potrzebujesz. Półki biurka również nie są przeznaczone do konkretnych celów, dzięki czemu można w nich umieścić co tylko zechcesz.\r\n\r\nJeśli jesteś osobą, która chce się często poruszać, możesz czuć się hamowany faktem, że nie możesz w pełni wyprostować nóg w każdej pozycji, ponieważ projekt nie pozostawia wiele miejsca z przodu.\r\n\r\n## 20.

Elastyczny i wszechstronny 4-tacowy organizer podblatowy\r\n\r\n![Flexible and Versatile 4-Tray Underdesk Organizer](/resources/images/21-best-office-desk-storage-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPosiadanie domowego biura oznacza możliwość dostosowania swojego biurka w dowolny sposób. Oczywiście, rynek pomysłów na biurko i przechowywanie ma wiele standardowych produktów, których potrzebujesz, ale są też niesamowicie kreatywne przedmioty, które pomogą Ci zorganizować w sposób, który ma dla Ciebie znaczenie.\r\n\r\nTen wiszący organizer Underdesk zdecydowanie należy do tej drugiej kategorii, umożliwiając trzymanie dokumentów i folderów blisko siebie podczas pracy.

Łatwo mieści się pod monitorem komputera, umożliwiając dostęp do materiałów biurowych za pośrednictwem trzech oddzielnych szuflad bez konieczności zajmowania dodatkowego miejsca na biurku.

Posiadanie tego organizera na biurko jest również pomocne w tym sensie, że może podnieść pozycję monitora, zapewniając dodatkowe miejsce na szyję, aby zobaczyć ekran. Może to być również zdrowsze, promując bardziej intuicyjną postawę siedzącą.\r\n\r\n## 24. Kreatywny i pomysłowy ziemniak na biurko\r\n\r\n![Creative and Imaginative Desk Potato](/resources/images/24-best-office-desk-storage-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeśli nigdy nie słyszałeś o ziemniaku na biurko, nie jesteś sam — ten kreatywny przedmiot z pewnością nie jest pierwszą rzeczą, która przychodzi na myśl, gdy ludzie myślą o pomysłach na biurko i przechowywanie. Ten ziemniak biurkowy pomaga uporządkować biurko, mocując się do samej powierzchni biurka i mając przegrody, w których można umieścić różne akcesoria. Jednak tym, co sprawia, że jest to szczególnie kreatywne, jest to, że obraca się również, co pozwala na wiele niuansów podczas chwytania akcesoriów podczas pracy.\r\n\r\n## 25. Trwały i kompaktowy organizer na biurko na artykuły biurowe\r\n\r\n![Durable and Compact Office Supplies Desk Organizer](/resources/images/25-best-office-desk-storage-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeśli chodzi o organizery na biurko, FITUEYES to jedne z najtrwalszych produktów na rynku. Ten organizer na biurko nie jest inny, zapewniając kompaktową konstrukcję wykonaną z trwałych materiałów. Chociaż istnieją przegródki o różnych rozmiarach, uwielbiamy to, że niekoniecznie są one dostosowane do konkretnych przedmiotów lub zastosowań.\r\n\r\nOgólny wygląd produktu jest również oszałamiający dzięki czarnemu matowemu wykończeniu, które będzie pasować do wielu nowoczesnych lub minimalistycznych projektów. W przeciwieństwie do innych dostępnych obecnie organizerów na biurko, ten produkt ma również gumowe nóżki, które pomagają ograniczyć ruch i zapobiegają zadrapaniom.\r\n\r\n## 26. Prosty i biały organizer na biurko\r\n\r\n![Simple and White Desk Organizer](/resources/images/26-best-office-desk-storage-ideas-designs-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeśli szukasz organizera na biurko, prawdopodobnie zrezygnowałeś już ze znalezienia czegoś, co jest całkowicie czarne lub wykonane z siateczki. Chociaż wyżej wymienione produkty są pomocne, często nie mają tego samego rodzaju elegancji, z którego mogliby korzystać osoby preferujące jaśniejsze kolory. Dlatego doceniamy to, że ten biały organizer na biurko Victor wykorzystuje białą warstwę farby, która znacznie lepiej łączy się z żywymi kolorami. Szuflady mają również przeźroczystą warstwę szkła pomiędzy nimi, co dodaje elegancji!\r\n\r\n## 27.

Dla niektórych biuro domowe to po prostu miejsce do wykonywania pracy, której nie można było wykonać w godzinach pracy, co prowadzi do tego, że nie wydają tak dużo pieniędzy na proces remontu biura domowego. Jeśli potrzebujesz tylko małego organizera na biurko, który wykona zadanie, jest to idealna opcja, która ma miejsce na telefon, wizytówki, a nawet ołówki!\r\n\r\n## 28.

Te plastikowe pudełka z organizerem działają jak Tupperware na żywność, umożliwiając kompaktowe pakowanie kawałków i kawałków różnych akcesoriów do przechowywania. Coś, co kochamy w tych produktach, to to, że są tak wszechstronne i mogą być również używane do wykonywania części pracy ze sobą w podróży!\r\n\r\n## 29.

Możesz jednak zwiększyć zapotrzebowanie na przestrzeń w łazience, dodając funkcję wewnątrz drzwi. Przymocuj dwa solidne metalowe wsporniki, które biegną wzdłuż drzwi.

Zbuduj wolnostojącą szafkę łazienkową\r\n\r\n![Build a Freestanding Bathroom Cabinet](/resources/images/07-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: homedit.com\r\n\r\nZamiast zwykłego uchwytu na chusteczki toaletowe przymocowanego do toaletki w łazience, możesz dodać więcej miejsca do przechowywania, wsuwając wolnostojący regał w tę przestrzeń. Może pomieścić przedmioty zapewniające szybki dostęp, takie jak szczotka do muszli klozetowej i dodatkowe rolki chusteczek toaletowych. Można go zbudować tak, aby pasował do każdej łazienki.\r\n\r\n## 28.

Na stole można postawić lampy, zegar, obrazy, podstawki i rośliny. Lampy stołowe uwalniają przestrzeń podłogową wykorzystywaną przez lampy podłogowe i unikają dziur w ścianach od kinkietów.

Wytnij wieszaki z drutu i uformuj z nich haczyki. Pomaluj je w sprayu i przykryj tkaniną lub wstążką. Teraz jesteś gotowy, aby uporządkować sandały i posprzątać podłogę w szafie.\r\n\r\n## 31. Wiszące półki podwójna przestrzeń szafy\r\n\r\n![Hanging Shelves Double Cabinet Space](/resources/images/11-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:photos.hgtv.com\r\n\r\nDodanie półek wiszących pozwala na przechowywanie przedmiotów w bardziej przystępny sposób bez układania w stosy. Układanie przedmiotów w stos, aby umieścić wszystko w szafce, oznacza, że musisz usunąć przedmioty na górze, aby dostać się do przedmiotów na dole. Te wiszące półki zawierają przedmioty, które byłyby ułożone w stos. Tak więc elementy, które byłyby na dole, są łatwiej dostępne.\r\n\r\n## 32.

Tak więc kończą rozrzucone na półce w szafce lub na stojaku na przyprawy, który zajmuje miejsce na blacie. Jednak ten obrotowy stojak na przyprawy wykorzystuje dwa dobre elementy do tworzenia przestrzeni. Najpierw zamienia niewykorzystaną przestrzeń w magazyn, a następnie umożliwia przechowywanie przypraw w pionie.\r\n\r\n## 33.

Zwolnij miejsce do przechowywania zlewu za pomocą haków na urządzenia\r\n\r\n![Free Up Sink Storage with Appliance Hooks](/resources/images/14-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:cosmopolitan.com\r\n\r\nJedną z najtrudniejszych rzeczy do przechowywania w łazience są akcesoria do pielęgnacji włosów. Mają dziwny kształt, są nieporęczne i trzeba sobie radzić z długim sznurkiem. Pomysł owinięcia sznurka i zawieszenia go na haczykach z tyłu drzwiczek toaletki pod zlewem usuwa je z drogi, ale sprawia, że są łatwo dostępne.\r\n\r\n## 35. Przesuwane szuflady ułatwiają przechowywanie zlewu\r\n\r\n![Sliding Drawers Make Sink Storage Simple](/resources/images/15-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: goodshomedesign.com\r\n\r\nJeśli otworzysz szafkę pod zlewem w czyimś domu, prawdopodobnie znajdziesz potrzebne środki czyszczące. Jednak prawdopodobnie będziesz musiał je zeskanować lub przekopać, ponieważ prawdopodobnie wszystkie są ze sobą pomieszane. Te wysuwane szuflady zrób to sam są łatwe do wykonania i uporządkowania środków czystości, dzięki czemu są bardziej dostępne.\r\n\r\n## 36. Nisko zamontowany wieszak na ubrania do przechowywania butów w wejściu\r\n\r\n![Low-Mounted Coat Rack for Entryway Shoe Storage](/resources/images/16-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: charterhouseinteriors.com\r\n\r\nKiedy wyjaśnisz gościom, że ten nisko zamontowany wieszak w przedpokoju jest przeznaczony na buty, a nie na swetry dla psów, prawdopodobnie będą chcieli go mieć. Czasami trzeba zdjąć buty, aby uniknąć śledzenia domu. Jest to łatwy sposób na uniknięcie potknięcia się o te buty i zaśmiecenie holu wejściowego.\r\n\r\n## 37. Półki druciane do przechowywania patelni\r\n\r\n![Wire Shelving For Storing Pans](/resources/images/17-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:acultivatednest.com\r\n\r\nTe stojaki druciane wykorzystują pionowy element magazynujący, aby patelnie były bardziej dostępne. Patelnie są ułożone w stos, pozostawiając nad nimi dużo miejsca. Jednak niektóre patelnie zwykle muszą zostać usunięte, aby uzyskać dostęp do żądanej patelni. Te stojaki wykorzystują dodatkową pionową przestrzeń dostępną w szafce i oddzielają patelnie, dzięki czemu możesz po prostu wyciągnąć wybraną patelnię.\r\n\r\n## 38. Atrakcyjne półki zapewniają przechowywanie od podłogi do sufitu\r\n\r\n![Attractive Shelves Give Floor-to-Ceiling Storage](/resources/images/18-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:rukle.com\r\n\r\nPółki mogą zwiększyć miejsce do przechowywania, ale mogą być również miejscem do dodawania elementów dekoracyjnych, a nawet stworzyć centralny punkt w twoim pokoju. Ta półka od podłogi do sufitu nie jest trudna do zbudowania i może być dostosowana do Twojego wystroju. Jeśli nie jesteś pod ręką, możesz znaleźć wiele półek do wyboru, które również uzupełnią Twój wystrój.\r\n\r\n## 39. Dodaj miejsce do przechowywania między pralką a suszarką\r\n\r\n![Add Storage Between Your Washer and Dryer](/resources/images/19-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:ideastand.com\r\n\r\nKolejna wąska, niewykorzystana przestrzeń, którą można przekształcić w pionowe wysuwane półki, znajduje się między pralką a suszarką. Regał ten może pomieścić środki do prania i czyszczenia. Jeśli masz małe dzieci, możesz rozważyć zrobienie tego lub wykonanie go tak, aby miał ramkę i można go było zablokować, aby dzieci nie miały kontaktu z chemikaliami.\r\n\r\n## 40. Szafki pod schodami maksymalizują niewykorzystaną przestrzeń\r\n\r\n![Cabinets Beneath the Stairs Maximize Unused Space](/resources/images/20-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: tinyhousetalk.com\r\n\r\nTe sprytne schody to zestaw solidnych, solidnie połączonych szafek. Blaty szafek różnią się wysokością o wysokość dwóch podstopnic na klatce schodowej. Stopnie pomiędzy blatami szafek to pudła ze stopniem na zawiasach, dzięki czemu stopień unosi się, aby odsłonić więcej miejsca do przechowywania. Szafki posiadają regulowane półki.\r\n\r\n## 41. Drzwi spiżarni przekształcone w stojak na przyprawy\r\n\r\n![Pantry Door Transformed Into a Spice Rack](/resources/images/21-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: centophobe.com\r\n\r\nPojedyncze słoiki są małe, ale przyprawy mogą zajmować miejsce na półce. Tak więc znalezienie niewykorzystanego miejsca, w którym można przechowywać przyprawy w pionie, jest świetne. Stworzenie półki na przyprawy z tyłu drzwi spiżarni to idealne rozwiązanie. Oprócz przypraw stworzono miejsce na zapasy żywności oraz stworzono kosze na ziemniaki i cebulę.\r\n\r\n## 42. Wielozadaniowe półki jako przechowywanie i dzielnik pokoju\r\n\r\n![Shelves Multitask as Storage and Room Divider](/resources/images/22-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: bhg.com\r\n\r\nTen regał ma pudełka i kosze, które tworzą miejsce do przechowywania, ale są również dekoracyjne. Ponadto jest przegrodą i punktem centralnym. Jest bez pleców, dzięki czemu przedmioty na półkach są dostępne z obu stron, a żadna część pomieszczenia nie jest traktowana jako mniej ważna dekoracyjnie.\r\n\r\n## 43. Zamontuj kolorowe pudełka na kapelusze do przechowywania w łazience\r\n\r\n![Mount Colorful Hat Boxes for Bathroom Storage](/resources/images/23-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:countryliving.com\r\n\r\nTen wyjątkowy pomysł dodaje do łazienki ozdobne miejsce do przechowywania. Mocowanie pudełek na kapelusze do ściany i używanie ich do przechowywania chusteczek toaletowych i ręczników w rolkach sprawia, że ten pomysł na przechowywanie jest kreatywnym punktem centralnym w pokoju. Możesz użyć kolorów i wzorów z pudełek na kapelusze w innych miejscach w łazience.\r\n\r\n## 44. Wypełnij organizer na buty środkami czyszczącymi\r\n\r\n![Fill a Shoe Organizer with Cleaning Supplies](/resources/images/24-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: littlepieceofme.com\r\n\r\nInnym pomysłem na środki czystości, które są zagracone pod zlewem, jest powieszenie ich z tyłu drzwi w torbie na buty z wieloma kieszeniami. Poszczególne przedmioty będą łatwiejsze do zauważenia, dzięki czemu będą bardziej dostępne, a jeśli masz małe dzieci, możesz powiesić je z tyłu drzwi szafy, które można zamknąć.\r\n\r\n## 45. Zainstaluj przydatne urządzenia na swojej wyspie\r\n\r\n![Install Handy Fixtures in Your Island](/resources/images/25-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:simplementegenial.cc\r\n\r\nW większości kuchni uchwyt na ręczniki papierowe montowany jest na ścianie. Jeśli jednak nie chcesz, aby wieszak na ręczniki papierowe był widoczny w Twojej kuchni, możesz skorzystać z tego pomysłu. Wyjmij szufladę i zastąp ją uchwytem na ręczniki papierowe. Ręcznik papierowy jest nadal dostępny, ale jest poza zasięgiem wzroku.\r\n\r\n## 46. Półka na komody utrzymuje potrzeby w pobliżu\r\n\r\n![Commode Shelf Keeps the Necessities Close By](/resources/images/26-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:organarchy.co\r\n\r\nTen sprytny pomysł można kupić lub stworzyć własną wersję. Zacznij od organizera na ramiączkach, który ma wsporniki, których możesz użyć do zawieszenia bocznych organizerów. Następnie zdecyduj, jakie przedmioty, takie jak rolki papieru toaletowego, chcesz przechowywać w toalecie, aby mieć do nich łatwy dostęp. Następnie kup lub utwórz uchwyty do przechowywania tych przedmiotów.\r\n\r\n## 47. Ukośne półki wygodnie mieszczą kosze na pranie\r\n\r\n![Angled Shelving Conveniently Holds Laundry Baskets](/resources/images/27-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: holdontoyourhatsblog.blogspot.hu\r\n\r\nJedna półka nad pralką i suszarką nie jest niczym niezwykłym, ale druga pochyła półka zapewnia dodatkową wygodę. Pochyła półka umożliwia umieszczenie tej półki nad półką na artykuły do prania. Pochyła półka posiada krawędź, dzięki której pomieści kosze na bieliznę. Nachylenie ułatwia wyjmowanie ubrań z koszy na bieliznę.\r\n\r\n## 48. Klipsy do zasłony prysznicowej utrzymują Twoje produkty kosmetyczne\r\n\r\n![Shower Curtain Clips Hold Your Beauty Products](/resources/images/28-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:lesmaisons.co\r\n\r\nKosmetyki zajmują miejsce nawet na dużej łazience łazienkowej. Kiedy masz mniejszą próżność, musisz być kreatywny. Używanie klipsów do zasłony prysznicowej do wieszania kosmetyków znajdujących się w tubie pomaga uporządkować je i usunąć bałagan z Twojej toaletki. Możesz zamontować dodatkowy wieszak na ręczniki w dogodnym miejscu, aby je powiesić.\r\n\r\n## 49. Zainstaluj lustro o pełnej długości z ukrytymi półkami\r\n\r\n![Install a Full-Length Mirror with Hidden Shelving](/resources/images/29-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc-v2.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:craftyourself.com\r\n\r\nTen pomysł spełnia podwójne zadanie. Zapewnia pełnowymiarowe lustro i ukryty schowek na kosmetyki i inne pomoce zdrowotne i upiększające. Zdobądź pełnowymiarowe lustro i zbuduj do niego ramę. Dodaj półki, gałkę i zawiasy. Pomaluj go lub pomaluj, aby uzupełnić wystrój łazienki. Następnie zamontuj go na ścianie.\r\n\r\n## 50. Grafika zamienia się w rozkładany stół\r\n\r\n![Artwork Transforms Into Fold-Down Table](/resources/images/30-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: spicytec.com\r\n\r\nSkładane stoły zapewniają wolne miejsce na podłodze w miejscach, w których przestrzeń jest na wagę złota. Jednak po złożeniu zazwyczaj wyglądają jak deska na ścianie. Stół ten staje się pozytywnym punktem centralnym w pokoju, gdy grafika zostanie dodana do dolnej części stołu, a składane nogi staną się częścią ramy.\r\n\r\n## 51. Wspaniały i nowoczesny wbudowany magazyn na pranie\r\n\r\n![Gorgeous and Modern Built-In Laundry Storage](/resources/images/31-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło:archiproducts.com\r\n\r\nPralki i suszarki do układania w stosy oszczędzają miejsce w małych pralniach. Regał do samodzielnego montażu zbudowany wokół pralki i suszarki do układania w stosy zapewnia miejsce na rzeczy do prania. Aby ukryć kącik do prania, dodaj zawiasy i drzwi. Jeśli masz małe dzieci, dodaj kłódkę. Wtedy Twoje dzieci nie będą mogły dostać się do detergentu i innych środków czyszczących.\r\n\r\n## 52. Praktyczne wykorzystanie przestrzeni otwartej ściany\r\n\r\n![Make Practical Use of Open Wall Space](/resources/images/32-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: ilovepalets.com\r\n\r\nKażdą pustą przestrzeń na ścianie można przekształcić w ozdobne miejsce do przechowywania. Zamontuj drewno na ścianie. Drewno można pomalować lub bejcować, aby uzupełnić wystrój kuchni. Następnie zdecyduj, jakie przedmioty chcesz powiesić. Przymocuj haczyki tam, gdzie są potrzebne, aby ozdobnie powiesić przedmioty. Wykorzystanie tego obszaru do powieszenia patelni jest świetne, jeśli chodzi o dostępność i dekorację.\r\n\r\n## 53. Zmień swoją lodówkę w magnetyczny pojemnik na przyprawy\r\n\r\n![Turn Your Fridge Into Magnetic Spice Storage](/resources/images/33-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: decor.immocercle.com\r\n\r\nOto kolejny pomysł na przechowywanie przypraw w niewykorzystanej, pionowej przestrzeni. Zdobądź małe, płaskie puszki z plastikowymi wieczkami. Oznacz przyprawy na pokrywkach. Przymocuj magnesy na dole i umieść na lodówce. Dzięki temu przyprawy są dostępne i zwalniają dużo miejsca w szafkach.\r\n\r\n## 54.

Zacznij od kalendarza biurkowego, w którym Twoja rodzina może zapisywać spotkania. Dodaj tablicę suchościeralną do szybkich wiadomości. Następnie dodaj naścienne uchwyty na teczki dla każdego członka rodziny, w których można przechowywać ważne dokumenty, które wymagają uwagi. Teraz masz obszar organizacyjny dla swojej rodziny.\r\n\r\n## 55. Wykorzystaj każdy cal dzięki rolowanemu schowkowi pod łóżkiem\r\n\r\n![Use Every Inch with Rolling Under-Bed Storage](/resources/images/35-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-homebnc.jpg)\r\n\r\nŹródło: diyfunideas.com\r\n\r\nSchowek pod łóżkiem to sposób na zamianę niewykorzystanej przestrzeni. Każdy może zarządzać tym pomysłem, nawet jeśli nie robi tego sam. Zacznij od regału z regulowanymi półkami. Pomaluj lub zostaw tak, jak jest. Przymocuj kółka z tyłu i dwa uchwyty po jednej stronie. Połóż go na plecach, a otrzymasz natychmiastowy schowek pod łóżkiem.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 19:41:51', '2021-03-10 11:38:32', '/resources/images/storage-ideas-for-small-spaces-featured-homebnc-351x185.jpg', 'https://homebnc.com/best-storage-ideas-for-small-spaces/', 0, 0);

Na powierzchni skośne, ścięgna podkolanowe, czworogłowe, bicepsy i barki są głównymi motorami tego ćwiczenia. „Ale w miarę upływu czasu i zmęczenia prawie każdy inny mięsień w ciele, w taki czy inny sposób, może zostać zaangażowany jako drugorzędny ruch, co sprawia, że ​​jest to totalny miotacz jelit” – dodaje. Wykonywanie uderzeń piłką z boku na bok w porównaniu z uderzeniami nad głową wymaga bardziej ukośnej pracy nad mięśniami brzucha.\r\n\r\n**Jak wykonać boczne uderzenia piłki lekarskiej: **Stań ze stopami rozstawionymi na szerokość barków z piłką lekarską po jednej stronie.

To ćwiczenie sprawdza również twoją wytrzymałość, zwiększając tętno za każdym razem, gdy podnosisz piłkę i przenosisz ją nad głowę. Aby jak najlepiej wykorzystać to ćwiczenie, użyj ciężkiej obciążonej piłki.\r\n\r\n**Jak wykonywać uderzenia piłką lekarską znad głowy: **Stojąc prosto, ze stopami rozstawionymi na szerokość bioder, trzymaj piłkę lekarską obiema rękami. Sięgnij obiema rękami nad głowę, w pełni rozciągając ciało. Uderz piłkę do przodu i do dołu w kierunku ziemi. Wyciągnij ręce w kierunku ziemi, uderzając, i nie bój się zginać kolan, gdy się obracasz.

Ruch, zwykle wykonywany piłką lekarską lub talerzem, polega na obracaniu tułowia z boku na bok, przy jednoczesnym utrzymywaniu pozycji siedzącej ze stopami nad ziemią.\r\n\r\n**Jak robić rosyjskie zwroty akcji: ******Usiądź prosto na podłodze z ugiętymi kolanami i stopami nad ziemią. Trzymaj piłkę lekarską rękami na wysokości klatki piersiowej. Pochyl się do tyłu z długim, wysokim kręgosłupem, trzymając tułów pod kątem 45 stopni i trzymając ręce kilka cali od klatki piersiowej. Stąd obróć tułów w prawo, zatrzymaj się i ściśnij prawe mięśnie skośne, następnie obróć tułów w lewo i zatrzymaj się, aby ścisnąć lewe mięśnie skośne. Ruch powinien pochodzić z twoich żeber, a nie ramion.\r\n\r\n9 balowych desek BOSU\r\n\r\n![Fit brunette using bosu ball in plank position](/resources/images/fit-brunette-using-bosu-ball-in-plank-position-royalty-free-image-1568754089.jpg)\r\n\r\nWiesz, że sesje cardio mają kluczowe znaczenie, jeśli chodzi o spalanie warstwy tłuszczu znajdującej się na mięśniach brzucha. Ale nadal ważne jest, aby ćwiczyć mięśnie brzucha, nawet gdy próbujesz zrzucić tłuszcz, mówi osobisty trener z Nowego Jorku Adam Sanford, założyciel Adam Sanford Fitness. Jego ulubiony ruch, aby to zrobić? Trzymając deskę na piłce aBOSU.\r\n\r\nTo trudniejsze niż zwykła deska, w której ręce spoczywają na podłodze, ponieważ BOSU sprawdza równowagę, mówi Sanford. „Kiedy twoje ciało próbuje znaleźć kontrolę, gdy twoja równowaga jest zagrożona, aktywowane są mięśnie brzucha, skośne i głębokie poprzeczne brzucha” – mówi. Wzmocnienie tych mięśni rdzenia pomaga również zwiększyć metabolizm, ostatecznie pomagając spalić więcej kalorii i tłuszczu.\r\n\r\n**Jak to zrobić BOSU Ball Planks: **Odwróć piłkę BOSU na gumową stronę i przytrzymaj obiema rękami krawędzie płaskiej powierzchni, mniej więcej na odległość ramion. Przytrzymaj deskę przez 30 do 45 sekund, wydłużając czas, gdy stajesz się silniejszy.****\r\n\r\n10 Bieganie po pochyłości\r\n\r\n![Low Section Of Woman Running On Treadmill In Gym](/resources/images/low-section-of-woman-running-on-treadmill-in-gym-royalty-free-image-1568753803.jpg)\r\n\r\nWykazano, że bieganie po pochyłości, a nie na płaskiej powierzchni, zwiększa całkowite spalanie kalorii nawet o 50 procent, mówi Jill Penfold, trener osobisty z Los Angeles. Niezależnie od tego, czy jesteś na zewnątrz na wzgórzu, czy na siłowni na pochyłej bieżni, zacznij spacerować przez pięć do 10 minut, sugeruje Pimpek. „Twoje tętno powinno wzrosnąć dość szybko, gdy nabierasz tempa” – mówi.\r\n\r\n**Wypróbuj ten trening na bieżni: **Chodź lub biegaj po pochyłości przez 5–10 minut. ****Utrzymuj jogging przez kolejne pięć do 10 minut, a następnie ponownie zwiększ tempo i zacznij biegać. „To nie musi być szaleńczy sprint”, mówi Pimpek, ale powinieneś pracować na tyle ciężko, żeby nie móc prowadzić rozmowy.

Kontynuuj naprzemiennie od 5 do 10 minut biegania i od 5 do 10 minut biegania przez 30 do 45 minut.\r\n\r\n11 Maszyna do wiosłowania\r\n\r\n![Woman using rowing machine at gym](/resources/images/woman-using-rowing-machine-at-gym-royalty-free-image-1568754439.jpg)\r\n\r\nTylko dlatego, że możesz nie mieć dostępu do otwartej wody, nie oznacza to, że nie możesz wpleść tego potężnego treningu cardio w swoją rutynę na siłowni. Jak mówi Penfold, korzystanie z wioślarza nie tylko podnosi tętno, co pomaga spalać kalorie i spalać tłuszcz, ale także działa na mięśnie nóg, tułowia, ramion, barków i pleców.\r\n\r\n**Wypróbuj ten 4-minutowy obwód wiosłowania:** zacznij od 20 sekund wiosłowania, a następnie 10 sekund odpoczynku. Zobacz, ile metrów przebyłeś w tym czasie. (Nie wychodź z wioślarza ani nawet nie puszczaj uchwytu, kiedy odpoczywasz, mówi Pimpek.) Powtórz to osiem razy, za każdym razem starając się pokonać dystans. Kiedy skończysz ten czterominutowy tor, wiosłuj szybko 500 metrów i zanotuj, ile ci to zajmie. „To liczba, którą będziesz chciał dopasować lub pokonać podczas następnej sesji wioślarskiej” — mówi Penfold.\r\n\r\n12 HIIT\r\n\r\n![Woman practicing jump squats in park](/resources/images/woman-practicing-jump-squats-in-park-royalty-free-image-1568754936.jpg)\r\n\r\nPodczas gdy stare myślenie głosiło, że sesje cardio w stanie stacjonarnym są najlepsze do spalania tłuszczu, teraz wiemy, że krótkie i intensywne serie ćwiczeń cardio w szybkim tempie są o wiele bardziej skuteczne. Hope Pedraza, osobisty trener ACSM i twórca inBalance, studia fitness i odnowy biologicznej z siedzibą w San Antonio, sugeruje wykonywanie interwałów naprzemiennie między ćwiczeniami, które działają na różne grupy mięśni.\r\n\r\n**Wypróbuj ten trening HIIT:** Po 10-minutowej rozgrzewce poświęć 30 sekund na wykonanie jak największej liczby powtórzeń przysiadów, pompek, wymachów kettlebell lub wiosłowania jedną ręką. Następnie odpocznij przez 30 sekund i wykonaj inne ćwiczenie przez kolejne 30 sekund. Kontynuuj przez 10 rund. Wybierz dowolne ze swoich ulubionych ćwiczeń — po prostu upewnij się, że wykonujesz naprzemiennie ćwiczenia, które działają na różne grupy mięśni, co pomoże niektórym mięśniom zregenerować się podczas pracy z innymi.\r\n\r\n13 Trening siłowy\r\n\r\n![Fitness girl lifting dumbbell in the morning.](/resources/images/fitness-girl-lifting-dumbbell-in-the-morning-royalty-free-image-1568755537.jpg)\r\n\r\nJeśli podnosisz umiarkowanie duże ciężary, ale nadal chcesz zrzucić tłuszcz z brzucha, nadszedł czas, aby zwiększyć intensywność, używając większych ciężarów i skrócenie czasu odpoczynku między powtórzeniami, mówi Tyler Spraul, CSCS, certyfikowany specjalista od siły i kondycji. główny trener wExercise.com. „Podnoszenie ciężarów jest bardziej widoczne po oparzeniu. Twoje ciało nadal spala kalorie nawet po wyjściu z siłowni” – mówi Spraul. Tylko upewnij się, że Twoja technika nie ucierpi, gdy zwiększysz wagę, co może prowadzić do kontuzji. Jeśli dopiero zaczynasz przygodę z treningiem siłowym, ten 15-minutowy trening całego ciała to świetne miejsce na rozpoczęcie.\r\n\r\n14 Chodzenie\r\n\r\n![Two African American women jogging together](/resources/images/two-african-american-women-jogging-together-royalty-free-image-1568755937.jpg)\r\n\r\nTak, dobrze to przeczytałeś. Po prostu chodzenie może znacznie pomóc w pozbyciu się tłuszczu z brzucha, mówi Sahmura Gonzalez, osobisty trener z Nowego Jorku.\r\n\r\n„Wydaje się to takie proste, ale od 45 do 60 minut energicznego spaceru każdego dnia może zdziałać cuda dla Twojego metabolizmu” – mówi Gonzalez. „Ponadto zapewnia, że nie przetrenujesz się nadmiernie, co może prowadzić do nadmiernej produkcji kortyzolu – hormonu stresu, który, jak wykazano, przyczynia się do tworzenia tłuszczu na brzuchu”.\r\n\r\nJeśli Twój trening chodzenia pomaga Ci się zrelaksować po stresującym dniu lub radzić sobie z emocjami, które w przeciwnym razie mogłyby Cię stresować, istnieje szansa, że pomoże Ci obniżyć poziom kortyzolu, co z kolei może utrzymać w ryzach tłuszcz z brzucha, mówi Gonzalez. Szybki marsz to skuteczny sposób na zrzucenie kilogramów – w tym tłuszczu z brzucha, który ukrywa mięśnie brzucha. „Godzina szybkiego marszu dziennie może prowadzić do utraty kilograma tłuszczu tygodniowo” – mówi Gonzalez.\r\n\r\n15 Yoga\r\n\r\n![Yoga classes](/resources/images/yoga-classes-royalty-free-image-1568756287.jpg)\r\n\r\nWłączenie Om nie spali tak wielu kalorii, jak bieg po pagórkowatym terenie lub podnoszenie ciężarów, ale może pomóc w budowaniu mięśni i poprawie wytrzymałości, co jest kluczowe dla przyspieszenia metabolizmu.

W rzeczywistości słaby TVA jest często przyczyną bólu pleców.\r\n\r\nNAJLEPSZE ĆWICZENIA DESKI\r\n![Leg, Arm, Physical fitness, Shoulder, Joint, Exercise, Knee, Stretching, Hip, Human body, ](/resources/images/plankjack-1547064653.jpg) \r\n\r\nHow to Do Plank Jacks to Tone Your Entire Body\r\n![woman doing ab exercise](/resources/images/screen-shot-2021-01-03-at-7-03-36-pm-1609725784.png)Lower-Ab Exercises to Set Your Core on Fire\r\n\r\n„Deski celują również w mięśnie czworoboczne i romboidalne (mięśnie górnej części pleców) w plecach, a także w mięśnie piersiowe (klatka piersiowa) i ząbkowane przednie (mięśnie ząbkowane, które owijają się wokół klatki piersiowej i ramion)”, mówi Blades. .\r\n\r\nKiedy angażujesz mięśnie górnych partii ciała, wywierasz mniejszy nacisk na rdzeń i jesteś w stanie dłużej utrzymać deskę. Możesz jeszcze bardziej zaangażować mięśnie ramion i pleców w deskę, mocniej chwytając podłogę palcami i dłońmi. Utrzymanie neutralnego kręgosłupa pomoże również zmniejszyć nacisk na szyję i sprawi, że trzymanie deski będzie mniej niewygodne.\r\n\r\n### Ale rdzeń obejmuje również biodra i dolną część pleców.\r\n\r\nKiedy ludzie myślą o swoim rdzeniu, zwykle myślą tylko o swoich mięśniach brzucha – ale siła mięśni obejmuje również biodra i dolną część pleców. „Solidna deska działa na mięśnie czworogłowe (przód ud), pośladki i mięśnie łydek w dolnej połowie” – mówi Blades.\r\n\r\nW rzeczywistości twoje biodra odgrywają dużą rolę w wzmacnianiu twoich desek. Twoje biodra są połączone z dolną częścią brzucha (czyli dolną częścią mięśnia prostego brzucha), więc zaangażowanie tych mięśni pomoże ci dłużej utrzymać pozycję w odpowiedniej formie. Kiedy ściskasz biodra, jesteś również w stanie bardziej wzmocnić rdzeń i unieść dolną część pleców – coś, co wielu początkujących fitness ma tendencję do przeoczenia.\r\n\r\n## Jak zrobić właściwą deskę\r\n\r\nIstnieje wiele różnych sposobów na uzyskanie idealnej deski, ale oto szczegółowy opis tego, jak wykonać wysoką deskę.\r\n\r\n1. Przyjmij pozycję na stole z ramionami bezpośrednio na nadgarstkach i biodrach w jednej linii z kolanami.\r\n2. Zaangażuj mięśnie brzucha, ramiona, plecy i pośladki, wyprostuj nogi do tyłu, aby wyprostować się w deskę i przytrzymać.\r\n3. Jeśli możesz, wykonaj ćwiczenie przed lustrem, aby sprawdzić, czy twój tyłek nie jest uniesiony. (Częsty błąd, ale twoje ciało powinno być płaskie, a nie odwrócone w kształcie litery V).\r\n\r\nW przypadku zmodyfikowanej deski Blades sugeruje upadek na kolana zamiast podtrzymywania się na palcach. „Wstań na czworakach i przesuń ręce do przodu, aby twoje ciało utworzyło ukośną linię od głowy do kolan, tak jak w zmodyfikowanym pompce” – mówi. Aby zrekrutować pośladki i ścięgna podkolanowe, trzymaj stopy uniesione w kierunku pośladków. Gdy opanujesz tę odmianę, możesz przejść do deski przedramienia, kładąc przedramiona na ziemi. \r\n\r\n## Jak długo należy trzymać deskę?\r\n\r\nStaraj się trzymać deskę przez 15 sekund, a następnie dojdź do 30, 45, 60 sekund i tak dalej. Zamiast patrzeć na zegar, Blades sugeruje ustawienie timera. W ten sposób nie będziesz uważnie obserwować upływających sekund. Nie zapomnij również użyć oddechu, głębokiego wdechu i wydechu.\r\n\r\nSkupiając się na oddechu, będziesz w stanie uspokoić swój umysł podczas niewygody\r\n\r\nNajlepszy sposób na dłuższe trzymanie deski? „Ćwicz, ćwicz, ćwicz” — mówi Blades. „Im więcej wykonasz ćwiczenie, tym więcej siły i wytrzymałości zbudujesz i tym dłużej będziesz w stanie je wytrzymać. Jeśli czujesz, że zaraz rzucisz, zmuś się do pozostania w desce jeszcze kilka sekund. Możesz to zrobić!\"\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 19:52:29', '2021-03-10 12:03:03', '/resources/images/push-up-variations-1561686713.png', 'https://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/a28747774/muscles-planking-exercise/', 1, 0);

Celem naukowców w tym badaniu, które zostało opublikowane w *European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, *było zbadanie, czy można być „grubym, ale sprawnym”, w debacie, która szalała w środowisku medycznym od ponad 20 lat. lat. Badanie wykazało, że aktywny fizycznie styl życia nie może ochronić serca przed negatywnymi skutkami nadwagi.\r\n\r\nW tym konkretnym badaniu pobrano dane od 527 662 dorosłych z Hiszpanii, w średnim wieku 42, którzy byli ubezpieczeni przez firmę zajmującą się zapobieganiem ryzyku zawodowemu. Podzielono ich na grupy według wagi, BMI i poziomu aktywności. Około 42 procent uczestników miało normalną wagę z BMI od 20 do 24,9; 41 procent miało nadwagę z BMI od 25 do 29,9; a 18 procent zostało sklasyfikowanych jako otyłe z BMI 30 lub wyższym.\r\n\r\nPoziomy aktywności oparto na wytycznych dotyczących aktywności fizycznej Światowej Organizacji Zdrowia (WHO), które zalecają wykonywanie co najmniej 150 minut umiarkowanej aktywności fizycznej lub co najmniej 75 minut intensywnej aktywności (lub kombinacji tych dwóch) tygodniowo.\r\n\r\nOsoby, które twierdziły, że w ogóle nie ćwiczyły, były uważane za nieaktywne. Osoby, które zgłosiły jakąś aktywność, ale nie spełniły minimalnych wymagań WHO, zostały uznane za niewystarczająco aktywne. Osoby, które osiągnęły minimalne poziomy WHO, zostały uznane za regularnie aktywnych. Ogólnie 63,5 procent było nieaktywnych; 12,3 proc. było niewystarczająco aktywnych, a 24,2 proc. regularnie.\r\n\r\nNastępnie naukowcy zbadali czynniki ryzyka sercowo-naczyniowego uczestników, kategoryzując je ze względu na wysoki poziom cholesterolu, wysokie ciśnienie krwi i cukrzycę, z których wszystkie zwiększają ryzyko zawału serca i udaru mózgu.\r\n\r\nPo przeanalizowaniu danych naukowcy odkryli, że bycie aktywnym jest zdecydowanie zdrowsze niż brak aktywności. Osoby, które zgłosiły pewną aktywność fizyczną, były mniej narażone na którykolwiek z trzech czynników ryzyka w porównaniu z ich rówieśnikami, którzy prowadzili całkowicie siedzący tryb życia. Ci, którzy byli bardziej aktywni, mieli również mniejsze ryzyko nadciśnienia i cukrzycy.\r\n\r\nJednak ci, którzy byli w kategorii z nadwagą lub otyłością, mieli znacznie wyższe ryzyko chorób sercowo-naczyniowych, niezależnie od tego, czy byli „regularnie aktywni”.\r\n\r\nOsoby, które były regularnie aktywne, ale otyłe, dwukrotnie częściej miały wysoki poziom cholesterolu, pięć razy częściej miały wysokie ciśnienie krwi i czterokrotnie częściej chorowały na cukrzycę w porównaniu z uczestnikami, którzy mieli normalną wagę, ale nie spełniali wytyczne dotyczące minimalnej aktywności. Osoby z nadwagą również były narażone na zwiększone ryzyko pomimo poziomu aktywności, chociaż wzrost ryzyka sercowo-naczyniowego był mniej dramatyczny. Jest tylko jeden problem: to najnowsze badanie w rzeczywistości nie mierzyło sprawności.\r\n\r\n## Liczy się sprawność krążeniowo-oddechowa\r\n\r\nTrudno opisać indywidualną sprawność wyłącznie przez wytyczne WHO. Spacer z psem przez 20 minut (co jest świetnym zajęciem!) zaznacza pole, aby spełnić te wymagania; tak samo robi codzienne treningi z krótkimi interwałami. Ale badanie, które dotyczy tylko spełnienia wytycznych, nie daje jasnego obrazu tego, co ludzie faktycznie robią; nie mówiąc już o tym, jak pasują, czy nie.\r\n\r\nTrudno jest również stwierdzić, że nie możesz być w formie, jeśli jesteś gruby – każdy, kto klinicznie jest zdefiniowany jako nadwaga, ale biegał w maratonach, może ci to powiedzieć. W rzeczywistości badania, które badają konkretnie sprawność sercowo-oddechową (nie tylko to, czy uzyskujesz minimalną liczbę minut aktywności zgodnie z wytycznymi), przedstawiają inny obraz.\r\n\r\nW szczególności metaanaliza z 2014 r. zatytułowana „Tłuszcz kontra sprawność śmiertelności z jakiejkolwiek przyczyny”, opublikowana w *Postępach w chorobach układu krążenia*, zbadała wpływ wydolności sercowo-oddechowej mierzonej za pomocą pułapu tlenowego i BMI na ryzyko zgonu z powodu z jakiejkolwiek przyczyny. Stwierdzono, że ryzyko śmierci zależy od poziomu sprawności, a nie od BMI.\r\n\r\nBadania wykazały, że ludzie, którzy byli sprawni – niezależnie od tego, czy mieli normalną wagę, nadwagę czy otyłość – wszyscy mieli podobne ryzyko śmierci z dowolnej przyczyny. Z drugiej strony osoby niezdolne do pracy były dwukrotnie bardziej narażone na śmierć z jakiejkolwiek przyczyny, niezależnie od ich BMI.\r\n\r\n„Optymalna masa ciała jest inna dla każdej osoby” – mówi naukowiec zajmujący się ćwiczeniami, dr Vaughn Barry z Middle Tennessee State University, który był głównym autorem badania *Fatness vs Fitness * 2014. „Możesz mieć BMI wyższy niż to, co mówią wykresy, jest optymalne i biegać 18 mil tygodniowo i być zdrowym. Bycie sprawnym usuwa i zmniejsza wiele zagrożeń dla zdrowia”.\r\n\r\nOstatnie badania pokazują również, że więcej ćwiczeń oznacza większą ochronę (dla niektórych osób przekroczenie minimalnych wymagań może być biletem). W badaniu z 2021 r. obejmującym ponad 90 000 osób, opublikowanym w *PLOS Medicine, *naukowcy odkryli, że ci, którzy odnotowali największą aktywność fizyczną – mierzoną jako umiarkowana intensywność, intensywność energiczna lub całkowita objętość – mieli około 60 procent mniejsze ryzyko chorób sercowo-naczyniowych niż ci, którzy zarejestrowali minimalną ilość aktywności. Inne badania wykazały, że na każde 1 MET lub „ekwiwalent metaboliczny” wzrost zdolności wysiłkowej, ryzyko przedwczesnej śmierci z jakiejkolwiek przyczyny zmniejsza się średnio o 17 procent; to do 25 procent dla osób, które są sklasyfikowane jako otyłe. Gdy osiągniesz 7,5 MET wydolności wysiłkowej, ryzyko przedwczesnej śmierci z jakiejkolwiek przyczyny jest podobne do tych z normalną wagą i tych sklasyfikowanych jako otyłe, zgodnie z badaniem opublikowanym w *American Journal of Hypertension.*\r\n\r\nPrzebieganie 12-minutowej mili jest klasyfikowane jako aktywność 8 MET zgodnie z naukowym Kompendium Aktywności Fizycznej dla Dorosłych, które przypisuje intensywność MET do prawie każdej aktywności fizycznej.\r\n\r\nW tym badaniu stwierdzono: „Te wyniki sugerują, że bardziej korzystne jest bycie sprawnym i nadwagą lub otyłością niż normalną wagą i niezdolnością do pracy”.\r\n\r\n##Skład ciała ma znaczenie\r\n\r\nNie oznacza to, że nie ma nieodłącznego ryzyka związanego z wysokim poziomem tkanki tłuszczowej, szczególnie tej, która znajduje się głęboko w brzuchu – która może powodować stan zapalny w organizmie i jest jednym z czynników zwiększających ryzyko chorób sercowo-naczyniowych , cukrzyca i inne choroby przewlekłe. (Warto również zauważyć, że BMI nie mówi nic o składzie ciała, ani nie odzwierciedla dokładnie, czy sportowcy – którzy mają dużą masę mięśniową – faktycznie mają „nadwagę”).\r\n\r\nUtrata tkanki tłuszczowej i zwiększenie masy mięśniowej mogą zdecydowanie poprawić zdrowie niektórych osób, podobnie jak zdrowe odżywianie, zmniejszenie stresu i uzyskanie wysokiej jakości snu. Ogólnie rzecz biorąc, chociaż nadmiar tłuszczu może stanowić zagrożenie dla zdrowia, nadal możesz być w formie i tak, nadal możesz być zdrowy. Najważniejszą rzeczą jest poruszanie się i praca z pracownikiem służby zdrowia, który pomoże ci mieć oko na całą resztę.\r\n\r\n„Fitness kontra otyłość to debata akademicka w ciągu ostatnich 20 lat”, dr n. med. Tim Church z Pennington Biomedical Research Center na Louisiana State University, jednego z czołowych lekarzy w kraju zajmujących się badaniami nad ćwiczeniami fizycznymi i otyłością. mówi *jazda na rowerze*. „To, co nie podlega dyskusji, to siła ruchu przy każdym ciężarze. Bez względu na wiek, wagę czy stan zdrowia regularna aktywność fizyczna sprzyja lepszemu zdrowiu i ogólnej jakości życia”.\r\n\r\n**Podsumowanie:** Wyraźnie widać, że spełnienie minimalnych wytycznych WHO dotyczących ćwiczeń nie zapewniało szczególnej ochrony osobom z wyższych kategorii BMI w tym badaniu. Ale badanie nie zamyka drzwi przed trwającą od dziesięcioleci debatą, jak sugerują niektóre nagłówki. Jedno badanie nigdy tego nie zrobi. Nie stwierdza również, że nie można być „wysportowanym i grubym” lub że sama „sprawność fizyczna” nie jest szczególnie ochronna, jak inne badania z ostatnich 20 lat.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 19:57:09', '2021-03-10 18:49:31', '/resources/images/close-up-of-athlete-using-smartwatch-royalty-free-image-1612966263.jpg', 'https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a35495183/fat-and-fit-study/', 0, 0);

Cała moja rodzina coś z tego wyciągnęła; mój tata wziął swoje ulubione krakersy ryżowe z groszkiem wasabi, mama ciastka mochi, a ja załadowałam wózek cukierkami do żucia zawiniętymi w jadalny papier ryżowy, malutkimi pudełeczkami kulek gumowych o smaku owocowym, soczystymi kubeczkami z galaretką i nie tylko. Uwielbiałem ten magiczny mały rynek. Podczas gdy codzienne życie wydawało mi się, że jestem dziwny i inny niż moi przyjaciele i wszyscy wokół mnie, te przekąski pokazały mi, jak wyjątkowa była moja tożsamość.\r\n\r\nNa studiach przez rok uczyłem się japońskiego, a na koniec moja klasa pojechała do Japonii. Tam alejki targowe mojego dzieciństwa eksplodowały w gorączkowym śnie Willy\'ego Wonki. Były sklepy i supermarkety *wszędzie*, nie wspominając o automatach wypełnionych smakołykami i napojami, które wyglądały i smakowały jak nic, czego wcześniej nie miałam. Lody lawendowe, gazowana soda brzoskwiniowa, krakersy o smaku ramen i wiele innych smacznych, teksturowanych przekąsek, których nawet nie potrafię opisać, bo nie jestem pewna *czym* one były. To było cudowne, ale potem poleciałem z powrotem do Stanów i to było to.\r\n\r\nAż do zeszłego roku, to znaczy, kiedy wysłano mi paczkę z japońskiej usługi abonamentowej Bokksu. Nie byłam pewna, czego się spodziewać, ale byłam zachwycona, gdy znalazłam pudełko wypełnione smakołykami. Firma rozważnie dołączyła broszurę wyjaśniającą przekąski, co było pomocne, ponieważ imiona wydrukowane na ich *kawaii* (słodkich), ilustrowanych kreskówkami opakowaniach były oczywiście w całości napisane po japońsku. Przekąski wahały się od słonych (malutkie marynowane paluszki ziemniaczane o smaku śliwkowym, chrupiące krakersy edamame, prażone krążki z sezamem) po słodkie (herbatniki gruszkowo-serowe, ręcznie robione twarde cukierki yuzu-sake, liofilizowane truskawki nadziewane czekoladą, czekolada matcha trzymać ciasta i nie tylko). Była nawet zielona herbata genmaicha z brązowego ryżu.\r\n\r\nW przeciwieństwie do wielu podobnych subskrypcyjnych usług przekąskowych, które wysyłają przekąski (np. Pocky), które można znaleźć na większości rynków azjatyckich w Stanach Zjednoczonych, pudełka Bokksu są wypełnione wyselekcjonowanymi przekąskami i herbatami pozyskiwanymi bezpośrednio od producentów przekąsek w Japonii.\r\n\r\nZałożyciel, Danny Taing, uczył się japońskiego w Japonii i zakochał się w *oishii* (pysznym) jedzeniu, tak jak ja. Współpracując z rzemieślnikami, jego firma wybiera tylko smakołyki, które najtrudniej jest znaleźć poza Japonią – np. kiedy moja mama próbowała kupić w Internecie cukierek, który lubiła, nie mogła go znaleźć. Bokksu też ma na to rozwiązanie. Możesz subskrybować comiesięczne pudełko przekąsek-niespodzianek, kupić dla siebie lub jako prezent (może na Nowy Rok Księżycowy?), *albo* kupować poszczególne przedmioty z ich pudełek na Rynku Bokksu. To jest świetne, jeśli zakochasz się w czymkolwiek (co bardzo dobrze możesz).\r\n\r\nMoim ulubionym aspektem tego pudełka było to, że było po kilka próbek każdej z 15 przekąsek, co pozostawiało mi wystarczająco dużo, aby wysłać również moim rodzicom. Mogliśmy podzielić się nimi podczas Zoomu, przypominając mi soboty mojego dzieciństwa, doświadczenie, które było szczególnie ważne w czasach, gdy jesteśmy daleko od siebie. Zawsze rozmawialiśmy o rodzinnym podróżowaniu do Japonii i chociaż teraz nie możemy, przekąski Bokksu były w międzyczasie kapryśnym, godnym substytutem.\r\n\r\n![Image may contain: Confectionery, Food, Sweets, Box, and First Aid](/resources/images/bokksu.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Bokksu Classic Gift Box (subskrypcja 3-miesięczna)\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:10:59', '2021-03-10 19:25:17', '/resources/images/SELF_giftbox.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/bokksu-box-review', 1, 0);

Gotowanie i jedzenie to czynności, które łączą ludzi i cieszą się wspólnym doświadczeniem. Ale w niektórych przypadkach doświadczenie może być wyzwalające – zwłaszcza jeśli masz złożony związek z jedzeniem. Jeśli odchodzisz od posiłków, gdy rodzina czuje się zdenerwowana, niespokojna, rozżalona lub w inny sposób niezbyt dobra, może to oznaczać, że nadszedł czas, aby ustalić pewne granice dotyczące jedzenia.\r\n\r\n„Większość ludzi, którzy chcą ustalić pewne granice związane z jedzeniem ze swoją rodziną, zwykle robi to, ponieważ próbują dokonać jakiejś zmiany dla siebie” – mówi SELF Monica Kelly, L.C.S.W. z Round Rock w Teksasie. Niezależnie od tego, czy chcą poprawić swoją relację z jedzeniem lub swoim ciałem, czy zmienić dietę z jakiegokolwiek powodu, wprowadzenie zmian związanych z jedzeniem może być trudne, gdy tradycje żywieniowe są głębokie.\r\n\r\nJednym z powodów jest to, że dla wielu rodzin jedzenie to nie tylko jedzenie.\r\n\r\n„Jedzenie reprezentuje kulturę i historię i może być sposobem, w jaki ludzie budują społeczność, znajdują wygodę i czują się przynależni” – mówi SELF Mishay Butler-Ozore z LMFT w południowej Kalifornii. Może to spowodować bałagan, gdy ktoś chce przełamać formę. „Członkowie rodziny mogą czuć się tak, jakbyś ich odrzucał – jakbyś nie tylko sprzeciwiał się jedzeniu lub przepisowi, ale także pokoleniom i historii” – mówi Butler-Ozore. „W niektórych rodzinach może to stać się bardzo osobiste”.\r\n\r\nWyznaczanie granic pozwala być otwartym i szczerym w odniesieniu do swoich potrzeb. Idealnie może powstrzymać cię przed poczuciem braku szacunku ze strony bliskich i żywieniem urazy i odwrotnie. A jeśli to konieczne, może otworzyć drzwi do znalezienia innych, wzajemnie przyjemnych sposobów łączenia i budowania relacji, mówi Butler-Ozore.\r\n\r\nNawet jeśli twoje rodzinne spotkania są teraz ograniczone (lub nieistniejące), napięcie rodzinne prawdopodobnie nie zniknie w magiczny sposób (przepraszam). Dla niektórych osób może to nawet wyłaniać się w ich umysłach jako niepożądana część powrotu do „normalnego” życia. Posiadanie planu z wyprzedzeniem może to znacznie ułatwić – i sprawić, że nie możesz się doczekać kolejnego dużego spotkania rodzinnego, kiedy tylko to się stanie.\r\n\r\nOto, jak eksperci zalecają ustalanie granic wokół jedzenia, z którymi zarówno Ty, jak i członkowie Twojej rodziny możecie czuć się dobrze.\r\n\r\n## 1. Najpierw wykonaj pracę wewnętrzną.\r\n\r\n„Najważniejszą rzeczą, którą mówię klientom, jest to, że musisz wewnętrznie jasno określić, jakie są twoje granice i udzielić sobie pozwolenia na ich posiadanie”, mówi Danielle Locklear, LMFT w Austin, w rozmowie z SELF. „Kiedy nie mamy jasności co do naszych granic i nie pogodziliśmy ich wewnętrznie i nie daliśmy sobie energetycznego pozwolenia na ich posiadanie, wtedy możemy zostać zepchnięci przez ludzi”.\r\n\r\nMówiąc prościej: jeśli chcesz, aby inni ludzie zaakceptowali i szanowali twoje granice, musisz je najpierw zaakceptować i szanować.\r\n\r\nWięc jak to robisz? Butler-Ozore sugeruje zadanie sobie kilku pytań: Jaką zmianę chcesz wprowadzić? Dlaczego chcesz to zrobić? Dlaczego jest to dla Ciebie takie ważne? Może chodzi o to, że chcesz zabronić spożywania przy stole pewnych komentarzy dotyczących ciała lub rozmów o diecie, a może twoja granica jest związana z konkretną zmianą diety, którą wprowadzasz i wiesz, że twoja rodzina będzie się odsuwać. Cokolwiek to jest, ważne jest, aby najpierw zdefiniować to w swoim umyśle. „Jeśli nie masz pewności, dlaczego w ogóle czujesz się w ten sposób, trudniej jest wyznaczyć granicę” – mówi. Możesz w końcu ustalić granicę w oparciu o to, co jest wygodne dla wszystkich innych, a nie o to, czego potrzebujesz.\r\n\r\nNadanie sobie tego pozwolenia może być trudne. „Wielu ludzi nie wierzy, że ma prawo stawiać granice rodzinie”, mówi Butler-Ozore. „Czujesz, że nie zasługujesz na to, czego potrzebujesz, lub że nie dbają o to, czego potrzebujesz, a to są myśli, z którymi musisz walczyć, zanim zmierzysz się z członkami rodziny”.\r\n\r\nGdy już wyjaśnisz, czego potrzebujesz, przypomnij sobie, że masz prawo o to poprosić. Możesz szanować swoją rodzinę i jednocześnie wiedzieć, że Twoje potrzeby są ważne, mówi Butler-Ozore.\r\n\r\n## 2. Zaplanuj rozmowę — i przećwicz ją.\r\n\r\nNajpierw zdecyduj, z kim będziesz rozmawiać. Może to osoba, która mówi lub robi rzeczy, które ocierają się o granicę, którą chcesz ustawić. Może to rodzica, którego możesz najpierw wziąć na pokład, aby mógł pomóc w zmaganiu się z resztą rodziny.\r\n\r\nNastępnie zastanów się, jak zamierzasz to powiedzieć. Każda rodzina jest inna, więc język i ton, którego używasz w swojej rodzinie, będą się różnić od tego, którego używasz w przypadku innych ludzi, mówi Locklear. Warto poświęcić trochę czasu na zastanowienie się, jak najlepiej komunikujesz się z rodziną i jak mogą zareagować na to, co masz do powiedzenia. Na przykład rozmowa może wymagać bardzo poważnego lub bardziej beztroskiego tonu, w zależności od tego, co wydaje się najbardziej naturalne w Twojej rodzinie i na co zazwyczaj reaguje. Może to również zależeć od tego, z kim konkretnie rozmawiasz.\r\n\r\n„Mogą być ludzie, którzy powiedzą:„ Dobra, fajnie brzmi dobrze, zrobię co w mojej mocy, aby to uhonorować ”, a są też inni, którzy nie zareagują w ten sposób” – mówi Kelly. Jeśli potrafisz przewidzieć ich reakcję, będziesz lepiej przygotowany na to, jak poradzić sobie z całą rozmową.\r\n\r\nPo ustaleniu języka, którego będziesz używać, zapisz go. Następnie powiedz to na głos, patrząc w lustro, sugeruje Locklear. „Rzeczy brzmią w naszych głowach inaczej niż wtedy, gdy mówimy je po raz pierwszy”, mówi. „Może to brzmieć jak roboty lub duszno, a dla wielu rodzin i kultur zostaną one odrzucone”.\r\n\r\nZastanów się, jak możesz wyrazić swoją prośbę własnymi słowami, aby była słuszna. A potem wygodnie wypowiadaj to na głos. Poważnie, przećwicz to kilka razy tak, jakbyś ćwiczył przemówienie lub prezentację, aby twój mózg był do tego przyzwyczajony i czuł się z tym komfortowo, zanim zacznie się właściwa rozmowa.\r\n\r\n## 3. Podnieś to w neutralnym czasie.\r\n\r\nJak każda inna potencjalnie drażliwa rozmowa, chcesz poruszyć temat graniczny idealnie w neutralnym momencie, Locklear mówi: „Rodziny mają tendencję do naładowanych emocjonalnie relacji. Robiąc coś, co może wydawać się przerażające lub nowe, lub przełamując schemat relacji, chcemy to zrobić w neutralnym momencie”.\r\n\r\nOsobiście zazwyczaj najlepiej jest, mówi Locklear, chociaż w niektórych sytuacjach pomocne może być zgłoszenie się najpierw przez telefon, e-mail lub sms (lub konieczne ze względu na pandemię). „Jeśli uważasz, że ktoś może mieć dużą reakcję na twoją granicę”, mówi, „może być troska o siebie, aby przeprowadzić tę rozmowę przez telefon lub e-mail, aby dać mu przestrzeń do wyrażenia emocjonalnej odpowiedzi, a następnie ponownie odwiedzić dyskusję kiedy już się osiedlą.\r\n\r\nRozmowa telefoniczna z wyprzedzeniem może również pomóc w ustaleniu wspólnych oczekiwań, mówi Locklear. Na przykład: „Tak, chciałbym dołączyć do ciebie na piknik, ale żeby wiedzieć, nie piję w tym miesiącu, więc nie będę mógł pić wina”. To może sprawić, że wszyscy znajdą się na tej samej stronie, aby nie było niespodzianek (jeśli jest to coś, co Twoim zdaniem może być przydatne dla kogoś z Twojej rodziny).\r\n\r\nNajbardziej popularny\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n   Trening z hantlami na dolne partie ciała, aby podnieść pośladki i nogi\r\n\r\n   Autor: Christa Sgobba\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n   Co to jest „ramię COVID”?

Locklear mówi, że jeśli potrafisz ustalić swoją granicę z dużym wyprzedzeniem – powiedzmy na miesiąc przed wakacjami lub danym spotkaniem – może to dać im czas i przestrzeń na reakcję.\r\n\r\nOstatecznie musisz dowiedzieć się, na jaki czas, miejsce lub metodę Twoja rodzina będzie najbardziej podatna.\r\n\r\n## 4. Postępuj zgodnie z taktyką DEARMAN.\r\n\r\nButler-Ozore sugeruje użycie techniki dialektycznej terapii behawioralnej, która koncentruje się na skutecznej komunikacji interpersonalnej, znanej pod akronimem DEARMAN. „Może pomóc ludziom nauczyć się, jak prosić innych o coś, czego chcą” – mówi. Oto, co to oznacza i jak z niego korzystać:\r\n\r\n- Opisz sytuację. Trzymać się. *„Dieta i waga pojawiają się często przy stole i nie jestem z tym w porządku”.*\r\n- Wyraź swoje uczucia. *„Próbuję rozwijać **zdrowsze relacje z jedzeniem**, a tego rodzaju rozmowa bardzo mi to utrudnia. Sprawia też, że nie chcę chodzić na posiłki rodzinne”.*\r\n- Potwierdź, co chciałbyś, aby się wydarzyło. *„Chciałbym, aby wszyscy mogli przestać mówić o diecie i utracie wagi, kiedy jesteśmy przy stole.”*\r\n- Podkreśl, dlaczego powinni się tym przejmować. Jaka jest nagroda? *„Pomoże mi to znów czuć się komfortowo podczas rodzinnych posiłków i da nam możliwość porozmawiania o innych rzeczach i nawiązania prawdziwej więzi jako rodziny”.*\r\n- Utrzymuj lub bądź uważny i skoncentruj się na tym, co masz nadzieję wyjść z rozmowy: na granicy, którą postanowiłeś stworzyć w pierwszej kolejności.\r\n- Wyglądaj pewnie. Łatwiej powiedzieć niż zrobić, ale pamiętaj, że zasługujesz na tworzenie i utrzymywanie granic dla własnego dobra.\r\n- Negocjować. Bądź gotów dać trochę, aby otrzymać. To nie znaczy, że musisz zrezygnować ze swoich granic lub poddać się. Oznacza to po prostu, że być może będziesz musiał zaoferować kilka kreatywnych rozwiązań ich problemów, które nie wymagają kompromisu w kwestii tego, co ostatecznie sprawia, że ​​czujesz się komfortowo i szanujesz. *„Z przyjemnością wymyślę początek rozmowy na początku posiłku, abyśmy mogli skupić się na innych, bardziej pozytywnych rzeczach, gdy jesteśmy razem.”*\r\n\r\nNajbardziej popularny\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n   Trening z hantlami na dolne partie ciała, aby podnieść pośladki i nogi\r\n\r\n   Autor: Christa Sgobba\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n   Co to jest „ramię COVID”?

Tylko Ty możesz określić, ile negocjacji jesteś w stanie zrobić, zanim podważysz własną granicę. Jeśli zaoferowałeś alternatywne rozwiązania i nie masz już żadnych sugestii, które trzymałyby Cię w granicach, być może nadszedł czas, aby zatrzymać się i uznać, że druga osoba może po prostu nie być w tej chwili gotowa do poszanowania Twoich granic (czytaj dalej, aby uzyskać więcej informacji na ten temat ).\r\n\r\n## 5. Zaakceptuj to, co możesz kontrolować, a czego nie.\r\n\r\nWyznaczanie granic nie zawsze będzie przebiegać idealnie. Zwłaszcza, gdy są związane z bałaganami, takimi jak rodzina i jedzenie. W porządku.\r\n\r\n„Kiedy ustalamy z kimkolwiek granice, prawdopodobnie pojawi się rozczarowanie, zwłaszcza jeśli zrywamy dynamikę relacji, którą mieliśmy z tą osobą z biegiem czasu”, mówi Locklear. „Mogą być rozczarowani i ludzie mogą się rozczarować. To nie twoja praca, to ich.\r\n\r\nMa na myśli to, że: Twoim obowiązkiem jest jasne przekazanie tego, czego potrzebujesz, ale sposób, w jaki reagują inni, nie jest Twoją odpowiedzialnością.\r\n\r\nWszystko sprowadza się do poszanowania Twoich potrzeb i energii. „Możesz komunikować swoją granicę i przypominać ludziom, kiedy się z nią ocierają”, mówi Locklear, „ale nie musisz być dostępny, aby ciągle się bronić lub zużywać energię, aby wyjaśniać sobie, czy ktoś jest niedostępny do słuchania.”\r\n\r\n## 6. Zdecyduj, kiedy nadszedł czas, aby przejść dalej.\r\n\r\nTen rodzaj pracy może być naprawdę trudny, mówi Kelly. „Naprawdę trudno jest pozbyć się systemu, żyjąc w tym systemie, dlatego ważne jest, aby uważać na to, gdzie jest twoja energia”. Nawet po podejściu do tego w najlepszy możliwy sposób, nadal mogą być ludzie, którzy tego nie rozumieją. W porządku jest mocniejsze wzmocnienie swoich granic, jeśli nie rozumieją, mówi Kelly. W porządku jest również odejście od tego, jeśli kosztuje to więcej energii, niż możesz oszczędzić.\r\n\r\n„Dopasuj się do tego, gdzie jesteś i bądź cierpliwy i pełen wdzięku wobec siebie, gdy nie możesz być tak bezpośredni w kwestii granic” – mówi. Może to oznaczać konieczność zmiany niektórych zachowań, abyś mógł nadal szanować swoje potrzeby w każdy możliwy sposób. Może to oznacza opuszczenie pokoju, gdy pojawią się rozmowy o jedzeniu lub zrobienie sobie przerwy od jednej konkretnej osoby, która tak naprawdę nie akceptuje lub nie szanuje twoich granic.\r\n\r\nMoże to oznacza nie chodzenie na imprezy rodzinne, na których będzie jedzenie. „Choć może to być trudne, chodzi o to, aby znaleźć się w miejscu, w którym możesz być emocjonalnie i psychicznie zdrowy, aby być z nimi” – mówi Kelly. Może to również oznaczać kreatywność w zakresie łączenia się. Zaproponuj inną aktywność, która nie koncentruje się na posiłku, na przykład rodzinny wieczór gier.\r\n\r\nWyznaczanie granic to ważne ćwiczenie cierpliwości. „Nie możemy po prostu przestawić przełącznika i rozpocząć nowego rodzinnego wzorca i oczekiwać, że nie będzie sprzeciwu” – mówi Locklear. „Jesteśmy kulturą natychmiastowej gratyfikacji, chcemy odpowiedzi i szybkich rozwiązań, a nie chcemy pozostawać w niewygodzie. Ale jeśli ludzie naprawdę pojawiają się w tych trudnych, niewygodnych rozmowach, po drugiej stronie jest naprawdę coś pięknego.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:11:48', '2021-03-10 19:26:59', '/resources/images/lobster_meal.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/setting-boundaries-around-food', 1, 0);

', '﻿![How Much Protein Do You Need in a Day](/resources/images/protein_food.jpeg)Nadine Greeff/Adobe Stock\r\n\r\nNawet jeśli nie jesteś do końca pewien, jakie białko jest technicznie — lub ile białka potrzebujesz — istnieje prawdopodobieństwo, że wiesz, jak dobrze się czujesz. Niezależnie od tego, czy lubisz zaczynać dzień od jajecznicy z nadzieniem, popijać składniki odżywcze w formie shake\'a po treningu, czy ugotować smaczny stek (lub kawałek oftofu) na obiad, prawdopodobnie znasz długotrwałą satysfakcję, jaką daje białko w wielu pysznych odmianach. I, jak będziemy rozmawiać, białko z pewnością robi wystarczająco dużo, aby zdobyć swoją niezawodnie dobrą reputację.\r\n\r\nChociaż wiesz, że białko to świetna rzecz, możesz mieć również kilka pytań. Na przykład, dlaczego dokładnie twoje ciało tego potrzebuje? Ile *dużo* białka musisz zjeść i kiedy powinieneś je zjeść? A jak wpływa na to poziom Twojej aktywności? Oto podsumowanie tego, co robi białko i ile składników odżywczych potrzebuje Twój organizm.\r\n\r\n## Czym właściwie jest białko\r\n\r\nBiałko jest jednym z trzech makroelementów (tj. składników odżywczych, których organizm potrzebuje w znacznych ilościach). W przeciwieństwie do węglowodanów i tłuszczu, białko zazwyczaj nie jest głównym źródłem energii, chociaż na pewno trochę z niego czerpiemy – białko dostarcza cztery kalorie na gram. Ale białko jest często określane jako budulec w organizmie ze względu na jego centralną rolę we wzroście i rozwoju.\r\n\r\nPrawie wszystkie produkty pochodzenia zwierzęcego – mięso, drób, jaja, nabiał, ryby – zawierają znaczną ilość białka, więc są oznaczane jako źródła białka, gdy mówimy o naszej diecie i odżywianiu. Ale białko jest również obecne w wielu produktach pochodzenia roślinnego. Na przykład fasola, groch, orzechy i nasiona zawierają duże ilości, podczas gdy warzywa i zboża na ogół zawierają mniejsze ilości, według USA. Agencja ds. Żywności i Leków (FDA). Całe ziarna będą miały więcej białka niż ziarna rafinowane, w których brakuje tej części ziarna, która często dostarcza dużo białka, jak wcześniej zgłoszono SELF.\r\n\r\nBiałka składają się z małych jednostek zwanych aminokwasami. W sumie istnieje 20 różnych aminokwasów, które można podzielić na dwie główne grupy według FDA. Dziewięć z 20 to tak zwane *niezbędne* aminokwasy, co oznacza, że ​​organizm nie jest w stanie sam ich wyprodukować i dlatego musimy je pozyskiwać z pożywienia. Pozostałe 11 jest *nieistotnych*, ponieważ organizm jest w stanie syntetyzować je z niezbędnych aminokwasów lub normalnego procesu rozkładania białek, według USA. Narodowa Biblioteka Medyczna.\r\n\r\nTeraz, kiedy białko jest dobrym źródłem wszystkich dziewięciu niezbędnych aminokwasów, według FDA nazywamy je białkiem kompletnym. Wszystkie produkty pochodzenia zwierzęcego są pełnowartościowymi białkami, podobnie jak soja. Kiedy brakuje białka lub jest ono ubogie w którykolwiek z tych niezbędnych aminokwasów, uważa się je za niekompletne. Większość pokarmów roślinnych uważana jest za niekompletne białka.\r\n\r\nDobra wiadomość dla wegetarian, wegan i ogólnie miłośników pokarmów roślinnych jest taka, że ​​nadal można łatwo uzyskać wszystkie niezbędne aminokwasy, jedząc różnorodne niekompletne białka. Jak wyjaśnia FDA, niekompletnym białkom często brakuje tylko jednego lub dwóch aminokwasów, więc często mogą nadrobić to, czego brakuje w drugim. Na przykład ziarna mają niską zawartość aminokwasu zwanego lizyną, podczas gdy fasola i orzechy mają niską zawartość metioniny. Ale kiedy jesz, powiedzmy, tosty z fasoli i ryżu lub pszenicy z masłem orzechowym, otrzymujesz wszystkie aminokwasy, które otrzymujesz, gdy jesz, powiedzmy, kurczaka. Podczas gdy ludzie byli zachęcani do spożywania posiłków w kombinacjach podczas posiłków, teraz wiemy, że nie jest to konieczne, według USA. National Library of Medicine, o ile przez cały dzień spożywasz różnorodne uzupełniające się niekompletne białka.\r\n\r\n## Dlaczego w ogóle potrzebujemy białka\r\n\r\nTen pseudonim budulcowy nie jest przesadą. Te rzeczy są integralnym składnikiem każdej komórki w twoim ciele, w tym, tak, twoich mięśni.\r\n\r\nZEGAREK\r\n\r\nCo każdy rodzic powinien wiedzieć o zapaleniu opon mózgowych B\r\n\r\n„Jeśli nie dostaniemy wystarczającej ilości białka, nasze ciała nie będą w stanie prawidłowo się odbudować i zaczniemy tracić masę mięśniową”, dr Colleen Tewksbury, MPH, RD, starszy badacz i program bariatryczny menedżer w Penn Medicine i prezes Pennsylvania Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, mówi SELF.\r\n\r\nBiałko pomaga naprawić mikrouszkodzenia, które występują we włóknach mięśniowych, gdy są one napięte podczas ćwiczeń, wyjaśnia American College of Exercise (ACE). Ten proces niszczenia i naprawy jest tym, co utrzymuje i zwiększa masę mięśniową.\r\n\r\nAle białko jest ważne nie tylko dla osób, które ćwiczą: Oprócz wzrostu i naprawy mięśni, białko jest niezbędne do wzrostu i naprawy praktycznie *wszystkich* komórek i tkanek ciała — od skóry, włosów i paznokci po kości. narządy i płyny ustrojowe, według FDA. Dlatego szczególnie ważne jest, aby mieć go wystarczająco dużo w okresach rozwojowych, takich jak dzieciństwo i okres dojrzewania.\r\n\r\nBiałko odgrywa również rolę w kluczowych funkcjach organizmu, takich jak krzepnięcie krwi, odpowiedź układu odpornościowego, wzrok, równowaga płynów oraz produkcja różnych enzymów i hormonów, zgodnie z FDA. A ponieważ zawiera kalorie, może dostarczyć organizmowi energii do przechowywania lub wykorzystania. (Ale to zdecydowanie nie jest jego główny koncert, którym zajmiemy się za chwilę.)\r\n\r\n## Co dzieje się w twoim ciele, gdy jesz białko\r\n\r\nTo nie tak, że jesz kawałek kurczaka, a białko trafia bezpośrednio do twojego bicepsa. Białko w diecie jest rozkładane i składane na różne rodzaje białek, które istnieją w organizmie. Bez względu na rodzaj białka, które jesz — roślinne czy zwierzęce, kompletne lub niekompletne — pierwszym celem twojego organizmu jest rozbicie go z powrotem na wszystkie różne jednostki aminokwasowe, z których się składa, wyjaśnia dr Tewksbury, w procesie trawienia .\r\n\r\nNastępnie te małe pojedyncze aminokwasy są rekonfigurowane (przez wątrobę) w dowolny rodzaj białka, którego potrzebuje twoje ciało. Na przykład niektóre białka w organizmie tworzą przeciwciała, które pomagają układowi odpornościowemu zwalczać bakterie i wirusy. Inne pomagają w syntezie DNA, reakcjach chemicznych lub transporcie innych cząsteczek, wyjaśnia Narodowy Instytut Nauk Medycznych.\r\n\r\nPonieważ twoje ciało nie może przechowywać nadmiaru białka, od razu rozkłada wszelkie białka, których nie potrzebuje i zwykle przechowuje je w tkance tłuszczowej (jako trójglicerydy), zgodnie z podręcznikami firmy Merck. Rzadko, jeśli twoje ciało jest na czczo lub nie otrzymuje wystarczającej ilości kalorii pochodzących z innych makroskładników, rozbite białko może zostać przekształcone w glukozę i wykorzystane jako paliwo awaryjne, dr Whitney Linsenmeyer, instruktor żywienia i dietetyki w Doisy College of Health Sciences na Uniwersytecie Saint Louis i rzecznik Akademii Żywienia i Dietetyki, mówi SELF. Ale to nie jest typowe, ponieważ organizm preferuje węglowodany jako główne źródło energii (a następnie tłuszcz w diecie, jeśli organizm nie otrzymuje wystarczającej ilości węglowodanów). „*Możemy* przystosować się do wykorzystywania białka również jako energii, ale nie jest to idealne rozwiązanie” – mówi dr Linsenmeyer. „Idealnie, [nasze ciała] chcą zostawić to w spokoju, aby budować i utrzymywać tkanki ciała”.\r\n\r\n## Ile białka potrzebuje Twój organizm\r\n\r\nOk, więc ile białka tutaj mówimy? Według USA ilość białka, którego organizm faktycznie potrzebuje do wzrostu i naprawy tkanek, zależy od czynników takich jak płeć, wiek, wzrost, waga, zdrowie, poziom aktywności i ogólne zapotrzebowanie na kalorie.

Podobnie Międzynarodowe Towarzystwo Żywienia Sportowego (ISSN) zaleca 1,4 do 2 gramów białka na kilogram masy ciała (lub 0,6 do 0,9 grama białka na funt) dla większości osób ćwiczących.\r\n\r\nNa podstawie tych zaleceń, na przykład, osoba ważąca 200 funtów chciałaby otrzymywać od 100 do 180 gramów białka dziennie.

Ogólnie rzecz biorąc, im bardziej jesteś aktywny – im częstsze, bardziej forsowne i długie są twoje treningi – tym wyższy będziesz w tym zakresie, mówi dr Gonzalez.\r\n\r\nPotrzebujesz podobnej ilości po treningu, kiedy twoje mięśnie potrzebują natychmiastowej naprawy. Jak wyjaśnia Ansari, ilość białka, które Twoje mięśnie mogą przyjąć po ćwiczeniach, zależy od rodzaju i intensywności treningu oraz składu ciała – na przykład podnoszenie ciężarów przez godzinę sprawi, że Twoje mięśnie będą bardziej spragnione białka niż 30- minutowy trening cardio. Ogólnie rzecz biorąc, Akademia/DC/ACSM01802-X/pełny tekst) zaleca uzyskanie tego samego uderzenia białka (15 do 25 gramów białka lub 0,25 do 0,3 grama na kilogram masy ciała) w ciągu dwóch godzin ćwiczeń w celu zmaksymalizowania masy mięśniowej. naprawy, podczas gdy ISSN ponownie zaleca dążenie do 20 do 40 gramów (lub 0,25 grama na kilogram masy ciała).\r\n\r\nKonkluzja dotycząca białka? Ten składnik odżywczy jest niezbędny dla naszego organizmu, więc bez względu na wszystko chcesz uzyskać przynajmniej zalecane minimum. Jeśli ćwiczysz, zdobądź trochę więcej.

Jednakże, gdy kupujesz coś za pośrednictwem naszych linków detalicznych, możemy otrzymać prowizję partnerską.\r\n\r\nJeśli ostatnio rozejrzałeś się po swojej kuchni i stwierdziłeś, że potrzebujesz czegoś nowego: Witamy! Pozwólcie, że opowiem o grillu wewnętrznym 5 w 1 Ninja Foodi. Smaży, piecze, suszy, piecze i grilluje. Czy mój aneks kuchenny w kawalerce potrzebuje tego wszystkiego? Tak.\r\n\r\nPodobnie jak wiele innych osób szukałem na rynku standardowej frytownicy i nie mogłem się zdecydować, czego potrzebuję. Ludzie powtarzali mi, że powinienem go kupić, ale nie mogli mi powiedzieć, dlaczego. W końcu zdałem sobie sprawę, że frytownice serwują równomiernie chrupiące potrawy szybko i z mniejszą ilością oleju niż w przypadku głębokiego smażenia. Ale po przestudiowaniu takich rzeczy, jak napięcie i rozmiar, nie byłem pewien, czy wykorzystam je w pełni. Nie gotowałam mięsa od ponad dwóch lat – czy znudziłyby mnie frytki i chrupiące przepisy na frytkownicy kalafiorowej? To, że mam coś więcej niż frytownicę, sprawiło, że grill wewnętrzny Ninja Foodi 5 w 1 (210 USD, Amazon) jest tak atrakcyjny. Pomyślałem, że więcej funkcji zwiększy moje szanse na regularne korzystanie z niego.\r\n\r\nUrządzenie jest wyposażone w wyjmowany czterolitrowy koszyk do frytownicy, który mieści się w większej misce, w której można smażyć, piec lub suszyć do syta. Istnieje również nasadka, która znajduje się na górze zlewu i pozwala grillować jedzenie w pomieszczeniu (do 500 stopni Fahrenheita), uzyskując smak zwęglonego grilla bez zamieniania kuchni w chmurę dymu. Wszystkie te funkcje są kontrolowane przez łatwy w użyciu interfejs cyfrowy.\r\n\r\nPonad 12 000 najbardziej pochlebnych recenzji Amazon, z których wiele mówiło, że można grillować w pomieszczeniach z „minimalnym dymem”, ostatecznie przekonało mnie do siebie. Okazuje się, że recenzenci mieli rację. To urządzenie typu „pięć w jednym” jest warte swojej ceny. Odkryłam, że zastępuje toster, rzadziej smażę jedzenie na patelni, a grillowanie warzyw w domu stało się prawdziwą ucztą. Jeśli grillowanie i smażenie na powietrzu są wysoko na twojej liście priorytetów, powiedziałbym, że powinieneś się na to zdecydować.\r\n\r\nNie korzystałem z funkcji odwadniania, ale jeden z recenzentów zauważył, że najlepiej sprawdzają się mniejsze partie. Wielu recenzentów zauważyło, że funkcja pieczenia sprawia, że ​​kurczak i inne dania mięsne są delikatne. Niektórzy recenzenci twierdzą, że upiekli ciasta za pomocą tego urządzenia i – biorąc pod uwagę łatwy interfejs cyfrowy i rozmiar – nie rozumiem, dlaczego miałoby to nie być prawdą (jeśli jesteś zainteresowany, możesz skorzystać z samouczków YouTube).\r\n\r\nCzyszczenie jest również stosunkowo łatwe, wymaga jedynie szczotki do grilla lub podkładki Brillo, ale uczciwe ostrzeżenie, że nie jest to najbardziej kompaktowe urządzenie ani najcichsze. Jeśli jesteś osobą, która robi posiłki o północy, Ninja Foodi 5 w 1 Indoor Grill jest znacznie głośniejszy niż mikrofala, FYI.\r\n\r\nOstatecznie, w ciągu roku, w którym dokonałem kilku żałosnych zakupów (cześć, kamień do pizzy), Grill wewnętrzny Ninja Foodi 5 w 1 wciąż jest wielką wygraną. Chociaż jeszcze nie upiekłam ciasta ani nie zrobiłam suszonych plasterków jabłka, świadomość, że mogę, to połowa zabawy.\r\n\r\n![product image](/resources/images/ninja_foodi.png)\r\n\r\n## Ninja Foodi 5-w-1 Wewnętrzny elektryczny grill nablatowy\r\n\r\nDzięki temu wszechstronnemu urządzeniu możesz piec, smażyć, smażyć na powietrzu, suszyć i grillować.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:14:09', '2021-03-10 19:28:15', '/resources/images/SELF_favninja.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/ninja-foodi-5-in-1-indoor-grill', 0, 0);

Dodaj do tego regularne sezonowe toksyczne komunikaty – post-wakacyjne rozmowy o diecie lub presję na „nabranie formy” na wiosnę i lato – i masz idealną burzę dla nieuporządkowanych myśli i zachowań żywieniowych.\r\n\r\nW obliczu wielu wyzwalaczy i nie mogąc polegać na swoich zwykłych mechanizmach wsparcia, wiele osób może zmagać się z poczuciem braku kontroli nad jedzeniem. Dla niektórych może to pojawić się jako przymus przejadania się emocjonalnie; dla innych może to być chęć objadania się niektórymi pokarmami. Impulsy te mogą objawiać się w poważnych schorzeniach psychicznych, takich jak bulimia lub zaburzenia z napadami objadania się, chociaż nie każdy, kto doświadcza tych impulsów, spełni kryteria diagnostyczne dla konkretnego zaburzenia odżywiania.\r\n\r\nIstnieje mnóstwo powodów, dla których możesz czuć się poza kontrolą nad jedzeniem – i prawdopodobnie nie ma jednego prostego wyzwalacza, który by za to odpowiadał.\r\n\r\n„Może to być wynikiem biologii, emocji lub środowiska – i najprawdopodobniej połączeniem kilku z tych czynników” – dr Marian Tanofsky-Kraff, profesor psychologii medycznej i klinicznej na Uniwersytecie Służb Mundurowych Nauk o Zdrowiu, która bada zaburzenia odżywiania, mówi SELF.\r\n\r\nPonieważ istnieją tak różne przyczyny, nie ma również jednego sposobu, aby pomóc udaremnić to niekontrolowane uczucie. Jako osoba, która siedem lat temu zaczęła wracać do zdrowia po bulimii, mogę powiedzieć, że często konieczne są różne strategie. Oto sześć praktycznych, wspieranych przez ekspertów wskazówek, które mogą pomóc, jeśli zmagasz się z lękiem związanym z jedzeniem, a w szczególności z tym denerwującym poczuciem braku kontroli, jeśli chodzi o to, co jesz.\r\n\r\n## 1. Staraj się jeść regularnie.\r\n\r\nPomijanie posiłków lub ograniczanie jedzenia może być powodem, dla którego niektórzy ludzie odczuwają utratę kontroli nad jedzeniem. Kluczowym sposobem na zwalczenie tego uczucia – choć można to o wiele łatwiej powiedzieć niż zrobić – jest jedzenie w wystarczającym stopniu, aby być nasyconym i nie myśleć ciągle o głodzie.\r\n\r\n„Regularne jedzenie to duży element przezwyciężenia niekontrolowanego jedzenia” – mówi SELF dr Saniha H. Makhzoumi, psycholog kliniczny z Maryland, który specjalizuje się w leczeniu zaburzeń odżywiania. „Kiedy nie jemy wystarczająco dużo lub unikamy pewnych pokarmów, zaczynamy czuć się pozbawieni. W odpowiedzi na to nasze ciała szukają pożywienia, zwłaszcza tych, o których mówiliśmy sobie, że są niedostępne”.\r\n\r\nDlatego dr Makhzoumi zaleca regularne spożywanie posiłków. Dla niektórych osób, które mogą wyglądać jak trzy posiłki dziennie plus przekąska, gdy jesteś głodny. Pamiętaj jednak, że jest to bardzo zindywidualizowane, a „regularny” harmonogram jedzenia prawdopodobnie będzie wyglądał inaczej dla każdej osoby. Ważniejsze od ustalonej liczby posiłków lub przekąsek jest upewnienie się, że w ciągu dnia jesz wystarczająco dużo, aby nie odczuwać częstych napadów głodu. Dr Makhzoumi w swojej praktyce stosuje również podejście „wszystko dopasowane do żywności”, doradzając swoim klientom, aby spożywali wszystko z umiarem (z wyjątkiem jakichkolwiek ograniczeń medycznych/religijnych).\r\n\r\n„Jeśli pozwolimy sobie na spożywanie pokarmów, których pragniemy, możemy iść dalej, zamiast zajmować się tym jedzeniem” – mówi dr Makhzoumi. Jest to podobne do intuicyjnego jedzenia, podejścia, w którym ludzie nie próbują celowo kontrolować jedzenia, a zamiast tego skupiają się na dostrojeniu się do swoich poczucia głodu i satysfakcji.\r\n\r\nOczywiście regularne jedzenie może być trudnym zadaniem dla kogoś, kto czuje się poza kontrolą nad jedzeniem lub miał wcześniej problemy z jedzeniem. W takich przypadkach pomocna może być infolinia National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA) lub spotkanie z doradcą zajmującym się leczeniem zaburzeń odżywiania.\r\n\r\nKiedy przeszedłem przez wcześniejszą część mojej podróży zdrowienia, stopniowo przestawiłem się na schemat intuicyjnego jedzenia. Jem, gdy jestem głodny i przestaję, gdy jestem syty, i pozwalam sobie na to, czego pragnę. Nauczyłem się budować zaufanie do jedzenia, reagując na potrzeby i pragnienia mojego ciała, zamiast polegać na zewnętrznych zasadach, które kierują moimi wyborami.\r\n\r\n## 2. Rzuć wyzwanie i przeformułuj negatywną rozmowę o jedzeniu.\r\n\r\nPrzeformułowanie nieprzydatnych myśli i przekonań jest kluczowym krokiem w kierunku wolności żywieniowej. Często wiąże się to z odejściem od sztywnych zasad dotyczących tego, co, kiedy i ile powinniśmy jeść, które podsycają poczucie bezsilności wobec jedzenia.\r\n\r\nZasady diety są zwykle trudne do utrzymania, mówi dr Makhzoumi, więc kiedy jemy coś, co demonizujemy, możemy poczuć się jak porażka. Prowadzi to do myślenia typu „wszystko albo nic”: „Uważamy, że złamałem tę zasadę, równie dobrze mogę iść dalej i zacząć od nowa jutro” – mówi dr Makhzoumi. W rezultacie wiele osób waha się między jedzeniem aż do punktu dyskomfortu a ograniczaniem.\r\n\r\nPamiętam język, który otacza jedzenie, niezależnie od tego, czy jest to deprecjonująca samoocena w mojej głowie, czy negatywne rozmowy o jedzeniu i ciele w rozmowach z innymi. Chociaż głównie dokonuję wyborów, które uważam za „zdrowe”, odmawiam etykietowania niektórych produktów spożywczych jako „dobrych”, „złych” i „niedostępnych”. Z kolei posiłki nie są już emocjonalnym polem bitwy, jakim były kiedyś.\r\n\r\nJednym ze sposobów podejścia do tego przekształcenia jest terapia poznawczo-behawioralna (CBT), oparta na dowodach interwencja, która jest wysoce skuteczna w wykorzenianiu negatywnych wzorców myślowych i formułowaniu zdrowszej perspektywy. Polega na zbadaniu słuszności naszych nieprzydatnych przekonań (np. „Wczoraj źle się zjadłem”, „Nie powinienem jeść tego deseru” lub „Mogę zjeść tylko sałatkę na obiad”), a następnie ponownej ich ocenie i wymyśleniu bardziej zrównoważone alternatywne przekonania (np. „Nie ma nic złego w oddawaniu się czemuś, co lubię” lub „Nie muszę rekompensować przeszłych posiłków”).\r\n\r\nPodczas gdy wiele osób otrzymuje CBT z terapeutą (więcej na ten temat poniżej), ja skorzystałam z samopomocy, aby przećwiczyć ją na własną rękę (jedną z moich ulubionych jest *Przezwyciężanie bulimii i napadowego objadania się*). Istnieje również wiele samouczków dostępnych online przez licencjonowanych specjalistów od zdrowia psychicznego, w tym na YouTube, gdzie można poznać i zrozumieć koncepcje CBT oraz jak zastosować je w swoim życiu. Ćwiczenie taktyk CBT kilka razy w miesiącu jest jak regularna wymiana oleju w moim samochodzie: ułatwia mi dostrzeganie i radzenie sobie z podszytymi emocjami w codziennym życiu, zanim przejdą one w niechciane zachowania.\r\n\r\n## 3. Zwróć się bezpośrednio do swoich emocji.\r\n\r\nInnym powodem, dla którego dana osoba może czuć się poza kontrolą nad jedzeniem, są trudne emocje, takie jak stres lub smutek, mówi dr Makhzoumi. Wielu z nas nauczyło się wykorzystywać jedzenie jako sposób na radzenie sobie z uczuciami. Dlatego może pomóc dać sobie chwilę na zatrzymanie się i autorefleksję, abyśmy mogli pracować nad odkryciem podstawowej przyczyny naszych emocji, zamiast zwracać się do jedzenia jako sposobu na odrętwienie lub ucieczkę od nich.\r\n\r\nChociaż badania wykazały, że wygodne jedzenie niekoniecznie jest czymś złym i może służyć jako ważny mechanizm radzenia sobie, ważne jest również opracowanie alternatywnych sposobów regulowania naszych emocji. Ponownie, jest to przykład, kiedy terapeuta może przyjść, aby pomóc ci zrozumieć i poradzić sobie z podstawowymi stresorami w twoim życiu w bardziej zrównoważony sposób.\r\n\r\nAle są też rzeczy, które możesz zrobić sam. Dr Makhzoumi zaleca dziennikarstwo jako formę samokontroli, a mianowicie rejestrowanie i śledzenie, gdy czujesz się poza kontrolą i związanych z tym zachowań. Może to promować świadomość i odpowiedzialność, a także wskazywać możliwe wyzwalacze i wzorce tego, jak się czujemy i zachowujemy. Rzeczy do zapisania mogą obejmować to, jak się czułeś, co jadłeś, gdzie byłeś i co się działo w tym konkretnym czasie. Wykorzystując swoje uczucia i emocje — proces znany jako regulacja emocji — możesz dać im czas i przestrzeń, zamiast je spychać (oto kilka wskazówek, jak skutecznie korzystać z tej techniki).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrzez lata korzystałem z różnych narzędzi terapeutycznych. Medytacja pomogła stworzyć przestrzeń dla myśli, które wydają się mniej pilne i natrętne. Dziennikarstwo i sztuka są konsekwentnie oczyszczające, co pozwala mi cofnąć się i przetwarzać moje emocje i doświadczenia w bardziej obiektywny i współczujący sposób.\r\n\r\n## 4. Zrób coś, co uważasz za przyjemne.\r\n\r\nCzęsto zwracamy się do jedzenia jako źródła przyjemności, zwłaszcza jeśli ograniczaliśmy nasze spożycie, dr Melissa I. Klein, adiunkt psychologii w Weill Cornell Medical College, która specjalizuje się w zaburzeniach odżywiania, mówi SELF . Nie ma nic złego w jedzeniu rekreacyjnie lub okazjonalnym używaniu jedzenia jako środka wzmacniającego. W rzeczywistości radość, radosne połączenie i inne pozytywne emocje mogą być centralną częścią tworzenia zdrowej relacji z jedzeniem. Jeśli jednak uważasz, że jedzenie dla przyjemności jest jednym z powodów, dla których czujesz, że tracisz kontrolę nad jedzeniem, pomocne może być opracowanie alternatywnych źródeł przyjemności i sposobów reagowania na emocje, takie jak nuda lub frustracja.\r\n\r\nZaangażowanie się w alternatywną aktywność może odwrócić uwagę od jedzenia, mówi dr Klein. Pomocne może być posiadanie w zanadrzu celowych rozrywek, aby przerwać i złagodzić przytłaczające myśli i emocje.\r\n\r\nMogą to być czynności takie jak gra na instrumencie, kąpiel czy tworzenie sztuki. W końcu możesz być w stanie zwrócić się do tego rodzaju czynności dla pocieszenia lub przyjemności w chwilach, w których czułbyś się poza kontrolą, szukając zamiast tego pożywienia dla tych uczuć.\r\n\r\n## 5. Poszukaj pomocy eksperta.\r\n\r\nZastrzeżeniem, o którym należy pamiętać, jest to, że ludzie czują się poza kontrolą nad jedzeniem z wielu powodów, dlatego podejście uniwersalne dla wszystkich jest nierealne. Mając to na uwadze, jeśli to możliwe, skonsultuj się z ekspertem, aby określić przyczyny *dlaczego* czujesz się poza kontrolą. Może to być ekspert ds. zdrowia fizycznego, ekspert ds. zdrowia psychicznego lub jedno i drugie.\r\n\r\n„Dla kogoś, kogo jedzenie jest napędzane głównie fizjologią”, mówi dr Tanofsky-Kraff, „sugerowanie zmian w zachowaniu i czynności może być nie tylko bardzo frustrujące, ale także stygmatyzujące, co może dodatkowo promować wymykające się spod kontroli jedzenie, zaburzenia nastroju i fizyczne problemy zdrowotne związane ze stresem.”\r\n\r\nJeśli naprawdę nie wiesz, dlaczego nie masz kontroli nad jedzeniem, jeśli wydaje ci się to bardziej fizyczne niż psychiczne lub jeśli jest to dla ciebie nagła zmiana, pomocne może być skontaktowanie się z lekarzem pierwszego kontaktu, aby wykluczyć przyczyny fizyczne . Na przykład stany takie jak cukrzyca (typ 1 i typ 2) oraz nadczynność tarczycy mogą powodować znaczny wzrost apetytu.\r\n\r\nZnalezienie terapeuty może być onieśmielające, jeśli nie wiesz, od czego zacząć, ale istnieje wiele zasobów online, które oferują wskazówki. Możesz również poprosić swojego lekarza o skierowanie do terapeuty specjalizującego się w kwestiach związanych z odżywianiem, który może polecić kogoś, kto jest objęty tym samym ubezpieczeniem lub zna programy pomocy finansowej, które mogą zapewnić wsparcie. (Pomocne mogą być również wskazówki, jak znaleźć najlepszego terapeutę).\r\n\r\nZ powodu kryzysu związanego z COVID-19 następuje również napływ platform terapeutycznych, które mogą oferować tańsze i bardziej elastyczne usługi doradcze online. Kilka opcji to BetterHelp i Talkspace. Zanim jednak zaczniesz korzystać z firmy internetowej, zrób rozeznanie, aby upewnić się, że usługa, którą chcesz wypróbować, postępuje zgodnie z zasadami etyki i będzie chronić Twoją prywatność.\r\n\r\n## 6. Porozmawiaj z kimś o tym, jak się czujesz.\r\n\r\nChociaż skorzystanie z usług profesjonalnego terapeuty może być niewątpliwie pomocne, może nie być opcją dla wszystkich. Istnieją różne bariery systemowe, które uniemożliwiają ludziom uzyskanie potrzebnej im opieki psychiatrycznej. Niektórych nie stać na terapię lub nie ma ubezpieczenia, aby za nią zapłacić, podczas gdy inni mogą mieć problem ze znalezieniem kulturowo kompetentnych terapeutów.\r\n\r\nAle otwarcie się na nasze myśli i emocje może być niesamowicie opiekuńcze (choć tak, również zniechęcające). Moje zaburzenie było często najgorsze, gdy odcinałem się od przyjaciół i rodziny, ponieważ izolacja służyła jako podatny grunt dla poczucia „braku kontroli” w gopieniu i kuli śnieżnej. Wykazano, że pozytywne wsparcie społeczne promuje powrót do zdrowia po zaburzeniach odżywiania, mówi dr Tanofsky-Kraff. Nawet zwykła czynność zadzwonienia do przyjaciela i odbycia rozmowy w chwilach, gdy czujesz się przytłoczony, może pomóc złagodzić niepokojące myśli i zmniejszyć ładunek emocjonalny.\r\n\r\nWraz z nadejściem telezdrowia istnieje teraz mnóstwo darmowych lub tanich alternatyw dla tradycyjnej terapii, które pozwalają ludziom dotrzeć i podzielić się tym, przez co przechodzą, zamiast rozwiązywać te problemy w pojedynkę (ponownie upewnij się, że sprawdzasz je przestrzenie wcześniej). Obejmuje to wirtualne czaty wsparcia rówieśników, takie jak Support i HealthfulChat, oraz prowadzone przez lekarzy grupy wsparcia dla osób z zaburzeniami odżywiania, z których część można znaleźć na stronach internetowych NEDA i Eating Disorder Hope. Platformy te dają użytkownikom możliwość bycia wysłuchanymi, zweryfikowanymi i wspieranymi emocjonalnie przez siebie nawzajem. (Mimo to grupy te mogą się znacznie różnić pod względem praktyki, struktury i uprawnień osób, które je prowadzą, o czym należy pamiętać przed wypróbowaniem jednej z nich).\r\n\r\nIstnieje również wiele programów 12 kroków ze spotkaniami grup wsparcia online, które są poświęcone pomocy ludziom z problemami związanymi z jedzeniem, w tym Anonimowi Żarłocy, Anonimowi Zaburzenia Odżywiania oraz Anorektycy i Anonimowi Bulimicy. Programy te wykorzystują model oparty na abstynencji, aby poprowadzić osoby w podróż ku uzdrowieniu ich relacji z jedzeniem i ciałem. Nawet jeśli nie zdecydujesz się postępować zgodnie z 12 krokami (nie są one dla wszystkich), możesz wziąć udział w spotkaniu, jeśli czujesz się szczególnie niespokojny w związku z jedzeniem i chcesz się połączyć i być częścią wspierającej społeczności.\r\n\r\nNależy pamiętać, że zaburzone odżywianie i myśli, które mu towarzyszą, są bardzo złożone. Możesz zbadać różne strategie radzenia sobie, zanim znajdziesz taką, która współgra z tobą. Bądź dla siebie dobry. Jeśli masz długą historię nieprawidłowego odżywiania i przestrzegania zasad żywieniowych, naprawa napiętego związku z jedzeniem może zająć trochę czasu. Ale w wielu przypadkach możliwe jest nauczenie się ponownego dostrajania się do swojego ciała i jego naturalnych sygnałów, a także stopniowego zwiększania siły podczas jedzenia.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:14:52', '2021-03-10 19:28:52', '/resources/images/thinking_woman.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/tips-when-feeling-out-of-control-around-food', 0, 0);

Ponadto Sue-Ellen jest członkiem Światowego Kościoła Adwentystów Dnia Siódmego i powstrzymuje się od jedzenia wieprzowiny, skorupiaków i żelatyny, jak robi to wielu zwolenników.\r\n**Częstotliwość zakupów spożywczych:** zakupy dla czterech osób trzy razy w miesiącu\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes była zmęczona szukaniem świeżych sklepów spożywczych z callaloo, więc wyhodowała swój własny. „Istnieje duża różnica między świeżymi a puszkowanymi. Konserwy są w porządku – i zjem je – ale naprawdę uwielbiam świeże” – mówi SELF. Callaloo to zielone warzywo liściaste, podobne do jarmużu i kapusty, popularne na Jamajce, skąd pochodzi Sue-Ellen. Sue-Ellen od czasu do czasu kupuje callaloo w puszkach, ale nic nie przebije jedzenia świeżo zebranych warzyw z jej ogrodu, mówi.\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen przeprowadziła się do Stanów Zjednoczonych z Jamajki, kiedy była w szkole podstawowej. Jej rodzina mieszkała w New Jersey, zanim osiedliła się na Florydzie, gdzie znalazła wiele takich samych świeżych produktów, które jedli w domu, takich jak callaloo i ackee, zachodnioafrykański owoc powszechnie spożywany na Karaibach. Teraz Sue-Ellen jedzie około godziny z domu do centrum Bostonu, aby znaleźć składniki do swoich ulubionych dań jamajskich, ponieważ wiele produktów nie jest dostępnych na jej okolicznych targach.\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen stosuje dietę opartą na roślinach, ponieważ za każdym razem, gdy jadła mięso, odczuwała bóle brzucha i nieprzyjemne wzdęcia, a także nabiał i gluten, więc teraz unika tego rodzaju pokarmów. Od czasu do czasu Sue-Ellen gotuje kurczaka i ryby dla swojego męża Michaela i dwójki dzieci, Elizabeth i Malachi, ale cała rodzina lubi jej bezmięsne posiłki. „Wszystkie moje tradycyjne posiłki gotuję dokładnie w ten sam sposób, ale wyjmuję mięso, jeśli robię je dla siebie” – wyjaśnia. „Jedzenie tradycyjnych potraw przywołuje wspomnienia z domu”. Zakupy spożywcze dla tych produktów nie zawsze są łatwe, ale Sue-Ellen udaje się uhonorować swoje tradycje. Oto 10 przedmiotów, które odbiera podczas typowej wycieczki po sklepie spożywczym.\r\n\r\n1. Rynek Linstead Jamajka Callaloo: 21,99 USD\r\n\r\nJak wspomnieliśmy, Sue-Ellen dorastała, jedząc świeże callaloo, które trudno znaleźć w okolicach Bostonu. Kupuje callaloo w puszce, kiedy musi, ale smak po prostu nie jest taki sam, mówi. „Lubię moje callaloo z odrobiną chrupania i odrobiną mniej soli” – wyjaśnia. Teraz Sue-Ellen uprawia kalaloo latem i zamraża ją, aby przetrwała zimę. Gotuje ją z pomidorami, papryką i cebulą, aby podawać ją obok wielu posiłków.\r\n\r\n2. Cristobal Solone Kawałki Dorsza: 7,99 USD\r\n\r\n„Niedzielny obiad jest naprawdę duży tam, gdzie się urodziłam na Jamajce”, wyjaśnia Sue-Ellen. Zaczyna dzień od robienia ackee i solonej ryby na śniadanie. „Ackee i solona ryba to nasze narodowe danie na Jamajce”, wyjaśnia. (Sue-Ellen je ackee i jackfruit, aby trzymać się swojej diety bezmięsnej. „Jackfruit wygląda podobnie do solonej ryby, gdy jest podzielony na kawałki”, mówi.) Jej córka, Elizabeth, szczególnie lubi ten posiłek i błaga o „Mamusiu, daj mi knedle i soloną rybę. Chcę być Jamajczykiem”. Sue-Ellen mówi, że się śmieje i odpowiada: „Jesteś. Jesteś Jameryjczykiem.\r\n\r\n3.Spur Tree Jamaican Ackee w solance: 10,10 USD\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen tęskni za zbieraniem świeżego ackee z drzew na Jamajce, a także na Florydzie, gdzie jej teść uprawia własne owoce. „Na pewno można odróżnić ackee z puszki od świeżego, ale to nie przeszkadza mi w zjedzeniu go” – mówi. Oprócz przygotowania ackee z soloną rybą i owocem chlebowca, Sue-Ellen czasami podaje go z tofu.\r\n\r\n4. Żółte ignamy: 2,29 USD\r\n\r\n„Na Jamajce pieczemy żółte bataty na otwartym ogniu” – mówi Sue-Ellen. To nie jest coś, co może teraz robić w swoim domu, więc zamiast tego gotuje lub piecze. Sue-Ellen szczególnie lubi, jak słodycz uzupełnia niektóre bardziej ostre smaki. „Dobrze pasuje do ciecierzycy curry. To jak posiłek na pocieszenie” – mówi.\r\n\r\n5. Zielone banany: 1,49 USD\r\n\r\nJedząc zielone banany, „czuję się, jakbym znów była w domu”, mówi Sue-Ellen. Jej absolutną ulubioną rzeczą w zielonych bananach jest nostalgia, która towarzyszy jedzeniu ich. „Moja mama rozgniatała zielone banany i smarowała je masłem. Pamiętam, że to jadłem i smakowało tak dobrze”. Według Sue-Ellen pasują do prawie każdego posiłku, ponieważ smakują podobnie do ziemniaków.\r\n\r\n![Obraz może zawierać Owoce Roślinne Jabłka i Mąkę](/resources/images/medium11162020-SELF-CHELSEA-KYLE-1283%252520copy.jpg)\r\n\r\nChelsea Kyle. Jedzenie w stylu Drew Aichele. Stylizacja rekwizytów autorstwa Campbella Pearsona.\r\n\r\n6. 365 Whole Foods Market Organiczne kawałki mango: 6,99 USD\r\n\r\n„Dorastałam, jedząc mango z drzewa” — mówi Sue-Ellen. „Niektórzy ludzie na Jamajce jedzą dwa lub trzy mango z rzędu. Po prostu siedzimy i jemy je jak posiłek”. Teraz Sue-Ellen kupuje je głównie w mrożonych touse w koktajlach. „Smoothies po prostu smakują o wiele pyszniej z mango” – mówi.\r\n\r\n7. Plantany: 0,66 USD\r\n\r\nSue-Ellen jest wdzięczna, że ​​są one łatwo dostępne w jej okolicznych sklepach spożywczych. „Jem banany przy prawie każdym posiłku. Kocham je i są po prostu znajomym jedzeniem” – mówi. Podaje pieczone lub gotowane banany z jajecznicą tofu, w swoich kanapkach lub na miskach sałatkowych.\r\n\r\n8. Super firma Nasoya Organic Tofu: 3,99 USD\r\n\r\nRodzina Sue-Ellen uwielbia chrupiące tofu, a Sue-Ellen ma dwa sekrety doskonałego przygotowania tego: kupowanie supertwardego tofu i używanie odpowiednich naczyń. „Czuję, że żeliwny garnek naprawdę pomaga w chrupieniu go” – mówi. Przygotowuje tofu przy użyciu różnych przypraw, takich jak grillowane tofu (ulubione przez jej syna).\r\n\r\n9. The Jackfruit Company Curry Jackfruit: 5,99 USD\r\n\r\nWedług Sue-Ellen jedną z najlepszych rzeczy w jackfruit jest to, że jest tak wszechstronny. „Dopóki dobrze je doprawisz, jackfruit nabierze smaku twoich przypraw – tak jak tofu” – mówi. Sue-Ellen szczególnie lubi używać tej marki w pracowite dni, ponieważ jest wstępnie sezonowana w etui.\r\n\r\n10. Jamajskie curry w proszku Blue Mountain Country: 11 USD\r\n\r\n„Mogę po prostu wymienić tak wiele sposobów używania curry”, głosi Sue-Ellen, w tym soczewica curry, zupa curry, ciecierzyca curry i żółty ryż curry. Chociaż te przepisy obejmują całą gamę, curry w proszku Blue Mountain jest podstawą wszystkich z nich. „To jest wykonane z naprawdę autentycznych składników. To są prawdziwe rzeczy” – mówi sye.\r\n\r\n*Wszystkie produkty prezentowane na SELF są niezależnie wybierane przez naszych redaktorów.

Ale czym tak naprawdę są przeciwutleniacze i jak wpływają na Twój organizm?\r\n\r\nOd ketchupu po sok z granatów, wiele produktów spożywczych zawiera przeciwutleniacze. Prawdopodobnie słyszałeś, że te związki mogą wiele zrobić dla twojego zdrowia – były reklamowane jako robią wszystko, od zapobiegania chorobom serca do raka – ale czy są tak pomocne, jak mówią ludzie?\r\n\r\nPodobnie jak wiele rzeczy w dziedzinie żywienia, jest wiele do rozpakowania, jeśli chodzi o przeciwutleniacze. I pomimo twierdzeń marketingowych, które wyśpiewują ich pochwały, nie są one do końca panaceum na twoim talerzu obiadowym. Nie oznacza to jednak, że powinieneś je zdyskontować: przeciwutleniacze mogą przynieść ze sobą wiele korzyści.\r\n\r\nOd tego, jak dokładnie działają, do tego, w jaki sposób powinieneś je przyjmować (i ile), oto, co musisz wiedzieć o przeciwutleniaczach.\r\n\r\n## Czym są przeciwutleniacze?\r\n\r\nZanim zaczniemy mówić o tym, czym jest przeciwutleniacz, warto zrozumieć, co rozumiemy przez inne modne hasło: „wolny rodnik”. Wolne rodniki odnoszą się do każdej cząsteczki w twoim ciele, która zawiera niesparowany elektron, co czyni je bardzo niestabilnymi i sprawia, że ​​szukają innych związków, z którymi mogą się związać. Wolne rodniki mogą pełnić pewne ważne funkcje w organizmie, takie jak sygnalizacja między komórkami, ale ponieważ są tak reaktywne, mogą również powodować uszkodzenia komórek w procesie zwanym stresem oksydacyjnym.\r\n\r\nTwoje ciało wytwarza wolne rodniki podczas czynności, takich jak trawienie i intensywne ćwiczenia, a także w odpowiedzi na takie rzeczy, jak ekspozycja na promieniowanie UV, zanieczyszczenie, palenie i niektóre choroby, dr Chwan-Li (Leslie) Shen, prodziekan ds. badań w Teksasie Tech University Health Sciences, mówi SELF. Dopiero gdy wolne rodniki są produkowane w nadmiarze, mogą stać się problematyczne.\r\n\r\nZ drugiej strony przeciwutleniacze mogą pomóc w utrzymaniu tych wolnych rodników w ryzach. Przeciwutleniacze to związki – wytwarzane w organizmie lub spożywane ze źródeł zewnętrznych – które pomagają neutralizować w organizmie wolne rodniki i inne cząsteczki, które mogą uszkadzać komórki i tkanki, dr Mahdi Garelnabi, profesor nadzwyczajny nauk biomedycznych i żywieniowych na University of Massachusetts-Lowell, mówi SELF. Robią to za pomocą różnych mechanizmów, takich jak pożyczanie elektronu wolnemu rodnikowi, aby był mniej reaktywny lub poprzez wiązanie się z substancją w sposób, który zapobiega dalszym reakcjom.\r\n\r\nStabilizując te wolne rodniki, przeciwutleniacze mogą również pomóc w skuteczniejszym funkcjonowaniu układu odpornościowego i łagodzić przewlekłe stany zapalne, które uważa się za siłę napędową wielu problemów zdrowotnych, takich jak choroby układu krążenia i nowotwory. Przeciwutleniacze mogą również, poprzez oddzielne mechanizmy, pomagać w naprawie DNA i błon komórkowych. \r\n\r\n## Gdzie można znaleźć antyoksydanty?\r\n\r\nTwój organizm sam wytwarza pewne przeciwutleniacze, ale czasami to nie wystarcza. „Wiele razy twoje ciało generuje zbyt wiele wolnych rodników, a twoje ciało nie może sobie z tym poradzić, dlatego ważne jest zewnętrzne spożycie przeciwutleniaczy” – mówi dr Shen.\r\n\r\nIstnieją tysiące przeciwutleniaczy i są one obecne nie tylko w mocno przereklamowanych „superżywnościach”. Przeciwutleniacze można znaleźć w szerokiej gamie produktów spożywczych – takich jak owoce, warzywa, owoce morza, produkty pełnoziarniste i mięso – a także w postaci suplementów.\r\n\r\nNiektóre przeciwutleniacze są niezbędnymi witaminami, których organizm potrzebuje do funkcjonowania, podczas gdy inne są niezbędnymi minerałami. Przykłady witamin przeciwutleniających obejmują witaminę C (znajdującą się w brukselce, czerwonej kapuście i papryce), witaminę E (znajdującą się w migdałach, nasionach słonecznika i oliwie z oliwek) oraz witaminę A, którą organizm wytwarza z beta-karotenu (znajdującego się w Collard zielone, słodkie ziemniaki i kantalupa). Przykłady minerałów przeciwutleniających obejmują selen (znajdujący się w orzechach brazylijskich, wieprzowinie i indyku) oraz cynk (znajdujący się w ostrygach, wołowinie i pestkach dyni).\r\n\r\nSą też przeciwutleniacze, które nie są dokładnie uważane za niezbędne składniki odżywcze, ale nadal mają wpływ na komórki i tkanki, mówi dr Bradley Bolling, adiunkt nauk o żywności na Uniwersytecie Wisconsin-Madison. Można je znaleźć w roślinach, zwierzętach i innych źródłach żywieniowych.\r\n\r\nKilka przykładów tych przeciwutleniaczy to karotenoidowe kuzynki beta-karotenu, takie jak likopen (znajdujący się w arbuzie, sosie pomidorowym i keczupie) oraz luteina i zeaksantyna (znajdujące się w szpinaku, sałacie rzymskiej i boćwinie), kwas chlorogenowy (znajdujący się w kawie, jabłka i bakłażany), flawonoidy (znajdujące się w jagodach, herbacie i owocach cytrusowych) oraz ergotioneina (znajdująca się w grzybach). Wiele z tych nieistotnych przeciwutleniaczy jest badanych pod kątem ich potencjalnego wpływu na optymalizację zdrowia, zapobieganie chorobom przewlekłym, promowanie długowieczności i zmniejszanie stanu zapalnego, mówi dr Bolling. „Istnieją różne stopnie dowodów na skuteczność tych nieodżywczych przeciwutleniaczy”, mówi. \r\n\r\n## Jak jedzenie przeciwutleniaczy wpływa na Twój organizm?\r\n\r\nOgólnie rzecz biorąc, przeciwutleniacze mogą być pomocne, ponieważ zwalczają wspomniany problem stresu oksydacyjnego, który jest powiązany z szeroką gamą problemów zdrowotnych. Rak, choroby neurodegeneracyjne, cukrzyca i inne choroby metaboliczne to tylko kilka przykładów, mówi dr Garelnabi.\r\n\r\nOczywiście wiele czynników określa ryzyko zachorowania na różne choroby – stres oksydacyjny jest tylko jednym z nich. Badania wskazują na szeroki zakres korzyści zdrowotnych u osób, które spożywają więcej przeciwutleniaczy, ale National Institutes of Health zauważa, że możliwe jest, że korzyści płynące z diety bogatej w przeciwutleniacze mogą mieć związek z kombinacją substancji w pożywieniu – lub nawet z innymi powiązany styl życia lub czynniki żywieniowe — a nie same przeciwutleniacze.\r\n\r\n„Spożywanie żywności bogatej w przeciwutleniacze nie tylko atakuje jedną chorobę, ale czasami pomaga organizmowi w uzyskaniu równowagi” – mówi dr Shen.\r\n\r\nPrzyjrzyjmy się badaniom pokazującym związek między wysokim spożyciem antyoksydantów a zmniejszonym ryzykiem choroby. W jednym badaniu opublikowanym w *European Journal of Nutrition* naukowcy podzielili 23 595 Amerykanów na cztery grupy na podstawie ich spożycia przeciwutleniaczy. Ludzie, którzy jedli najwięcej przeciwutleniaczy, mieli o 21% mniejsze ryzyko śmierci w ciągu 13 lat niż ludzie, którzy jedli najmniej, nawet jeśli naukowcy wzięli pod uwagę odpowiednie czynniki łagodzące, takie jak wiek, płeć i status ekonomiczny uczestników. (Warto jednak zauważyć, że badanie to opierało się na 24-godzinnym przypomnieniu diety lub wspomnieniach ludzi tylko jednego dnia jedzenia. Ponadto, jak wspomnieliśmy powyżej, korzyści mogą mieć również związek z innymi substancjami w pożywieniu , którego nie można tutaj zmierzyć).\r\n\r\nWedług metaanalizy opublikowanej w *Critical Reviews in Oncology/Hematology* dotyczącej 19 opublikowanych wcześniej badań obejmujących ponad 700 000 osób, dieta bogata w przeciwutleniacze może zmniejszyć ryzyko zachorowania na raka, ze znaczną redukcją obserwowaną w przypadku jelita grubego, endometrium i żołądka w szczególności. Badania wskazują również, że duże ilości przeciwutleniaczy w diecie mogą wpływać na ryzyko rozwoju cukrzycy typu 2 i udaru mózgu.\r\n\r\nDlatego uważa się, że spożywanie dużej ilości przeciwutleniaczy w diecie jest dobre dla zdrowia. Ale ponieważ różne przeciwutleniacze mogą mieć różny wpływ na organizm, warto porozmawiać z lekarzem o konkretnej historii zdrowia i czynnikach ryzyka, a także o roli, jaką niektóre przeciwutleniacze mogą mieć na twoje zdrowie. Na przykład, wyższe spożycie flawonoidów od dawna wiąże się ze zmniejszonym ryzykiem chorób serca, a niedawne badanie w *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* sugeruje również związek ze zmniejszonym ryzykiem choroby Alzheimera. Jeśli martwisz się konkretnym stanem, porozmawiaj ze swoim lekarzem o tym, czy powinieneś skupić się na jedzeniu więcej jednej konkretnej rzeczy – zwłaszcza jeśli czujesz, że Twoja dieta jest w jakikolwiek sposób niezrównoważona.\r\n\r\nPodsumowując, przeciwutleniacze w diecie nie zastępują leczenia, a zbilansowana dieta jest zawsze bardziej korzystna niż poleganie na jednym składniku odżywczym. Warto zauważyć, że większość badań, które omówiliśmy do tej pory, dotyczyła całkowitego spożycia przeciwutleniaczy, a naukowcy odkryli korelacje, a nie związki przyczynowo-skutkowe. Chociaż istnieje wiele badań wskazujących na związek między wyższym spożyciem przeciwutleniaczy a niższym ryzykiem chorób, nie możemy z całą pewnością stwierdzić, że przyjmowanie jednego przeciwutleniacza zmieni Twoje zdrowie w określony sposób. Chodzi o równowagę i różnorodność, co wyjaśnimy za chwilę. \r\n\r\n## Jak wprowadzić antyoksydanty do swojej diety?\r\n\r\nW przypadku przeciwutleniaczy, które należą do kategorii niezbędnych składników odżywczych, istnieją zalecane dzienne porcje (RDA), które pomogą Ci zaplanować spożycie. W przypadku selenu RDA wynosi 55 mikrogramów dziennie. W przypadku cynku i witamin A, C i E RDA dla Twojego wieku i płci można znaleźć w Wytycznych żywieniowych dla Amerykanów. (Na przykład kobiety w wieku 31-50 lat powinny strzelać do 8 mg cynku, 700 mikrogramów witaminy A, 15 mg witaminy E i 75 mg witaminy C.) Niektóre z tych niezbędnych składników odżywczych, takie jak witamina C i witamina A, są wymienione na etykietach żywności, więc łatwo zliczyć, ile otrzymujesz.\r\n\r\nNie ma standardowej zalecanej ilości do spożycia dla przeciwutleniaczy, które nie są niezbędnymi składnikami odżywczymi; naukowcy wciąż je określają, mówi dr Bolling. Nie zobaczysz też dawki tych przeciwutleniaczy wymienionych na etykiecie żywności, która je zawiera.\r\n\r\nWięc zamiast próbować trafić w określoną ich ilość, możesz zamiast tego dodać do swojej diety więcej pokarmów zawierających przeciwutleniacze. „Samo zjedzenie jagód na śniadanie lub zjedzenie cytrusów lub picie zielonej herbaty wystarczy, aby wprowadzić ludzi na wyższy poziom wzorców konsumpcji” – mówi dr Bolling.\r\n\r\nNajlepszym sposobem na wzbogacenie diety w przeciwutleniacze jest spożywanie dużej ilości owoców i warzyw (Wytyczne żywieniowe USA zalecają dwie i pół szklanki warzyw i dwie szklanki owoców dziennie), mówi dr Garelnabi. Orzechy, produkty pełnoziarniste, gorzka czekolada i herbata są również dobrymi źródłami przeciwutleniaczy, podobnie jak chude mięso i owoce morza, mówi dr Shen.\r\n\r\nRóżnorodność jest również ważna w Twojej diecie, ponieważ niektóre przeciwutleniacze działają lepiej razem, mówi dr Garelnabi. Aby upewnić się, że otrzymujesz różnorodność, spróbuj umieścić na talerzu różne kolory, ponieważ kolor owoców i warzyw może służyć jako wskazówka co do zawartości przeciwutleniaczy, sugeruje badanie opublikowane w *Current Research in Food Science**. * Na przykład czerwonawe produkty, takie jak jabłka, truskawki, wiśnie, czerwona kapusta i czerwona papryka, są zazwyczaj bogate w pewien rodzaj flawonoidów zwany antocyjaniną, podczas gdy pomarańczowe i żółte produkty, takie jak mango, żółta papryka, pomarańcze, banany i nektaryny są dobre źródła witaminy C.\r\n\r\nA co z suplementami? Doładowywanie przeciwutleniaczy w postaci suplementów tak naprawdę nie przynosi większych korzyści. W rzeczywistości przegląd badań z 2014 r. stwierdził, że „nie ma dowodów na poparcie stosowania suplementów przeciwutleniających w pierwotnej profilaktyce chorób przewlekłych lub śmiertelności”. W rzeczywistości istnieją dowody na to, że mogą być nawet szkodliwe, zwłaszcza w dużych dawkach.\r\n\r\nZrównoważona dieta dla większości ludzi oznacza, że prawdopodobnie otrzymujesz wystarczającą ilość przeciwutleniaczy i nie musisz przyjmować suplementów przeciwutleniających, mówi dr Garelnabi. Jednak niektórzy ludzie *mogą* odnieść korzyści z dodawania suplementów, zwłaszcza jeśli nie tolerują lub muszą unikać niektórych pokarmów. Po prostu porozmawiaj z lekarzem przed przyjęciem jakichkolwiek suplementów, aby ustalić, czy naprawdę ich potrzebujesz i czy mogą wchodzić w interakcje z jakimikolwiek lekami, które przyjmujesz.\r\n\r\nW przeciwnym razie, jeśli skupiasz się na różnorodności w swojej diecie i starasz się spróbować nowych owoców lub warzyw, aby poszerzyć to, co przyjmujesz, prawdopodobnie radzisz sobie dobrze na froncie przeciwutleniaczy. Aby naprawdę wyostrzyć te korzyści, możesz połączyć zbilansowaną płytę z rutynowym treningiem: ćwiczenia — o ile nie przetrenujesz się — mogą nawet pomóc zwiększyć produkcję naturalnych przeciwutleniaczy w organizmie, mówi dr Garelnabi.\r\n\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:16:28', '2021-03-10 19:30:24', '/resources/images/food_fruits.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/what-are-antioxidants', 0, 0);

Często jest to żywność, która odgrywa dużą rolę nie tylko w naszych rodzinach, ale także w naszej większej kulturze.\r\n\r\n„Jedzenie kulturalnych potraw może nas przenieść z powrotem do pocieszającego doświadczenia, które ma wartość sentymentalną lub nostalgiczną” – mówi SELF Samina Kalloo, RDN, CDN, zarejestrowana dietetyk z siedzibą w Nowym Jorku. „Jedzenie ma moc powrotu do prostszych czasów”.\r\n\r\nAle jest też druga zaleta: próbowanie potraw, których możesz nie znać z *innych* kultur, może być również naprawdę wyjątkowym sposobem, aby z szacunkiem je poznać i doświadczyć, co może dać ci lepsze zrozumienie tych kultur w większej liczbie aktywny sposób z pierwszej ręki. Jako kolejny plus, próbowanie różnych potraw z innych kultur może również pomóc rozwinąć podniebienie, co jest szczególnie pomocne, jeśli masz rutynę pokarmową.\r\n\r\nRóżne kultury mają tendencję do używania różnych składników – w tym owoców, warzyw, ziół i przypraw – oraz różnych technik przygotowywania, które nadają potrawom wyjątkowy smak i konsystencję, których możesz nie znać w inny sposób, wyjaśnia Gina DeLuca, RD, CDN, zarejestrowany dietetyk w Perlmutter Cancer Center w NYU Langone Hospital – Long Island.\r\n\r\nSzanse są całkiem spore, że masz kilka własnych ulubionych kulturalnych potraw, do których możesz się zwrócić, gdy będziesz potrzebować trochę poprawy. Ale jeśli chcesz poszerzyć swoje gusta i spróbować czegoś nowego (lub usłyszeć, jak ktoś chwali jedzenie, które już kochasz), sprawdź te 18 ulubionych dań zarejestrowanych dietetyków z ich kultur. \r\n\r\n## 1. Sałatka Horiatiki\r\n\r\n„Dorastałem, jedząc greckie jedzenie, a jedną rzeczą, którą mogę jeść codziennie, jest sałatka grecka, zwana także sałatką horiatiki. Zawiera proste, świeże składniki, takie jak pomidor, pokrojony ogórek, zielony pieprz, pokrojoną czerwoną cebulę, oliwki Kalamata i oczywiście ser feta, i jest polany oliwą z oliwek z pierwszego tłoczenia, octem z czerwonego wina, oregano, solą i pieprzem. Przy użyciu wysokiej jakości oliwy z oliwek z pozostałymi świeżymi składnikami, smaki wybijają się.\r\n\r\nByłem z nią zapoznawany codziennie przy stole obiadowym, szczególnie w okresie letnim, kiedy składniki były świeżo wyhodowane z naszego ogrodu. Jem to ze świeżym pieczywem – czasami chlebem pita – obok mojego głównego dania głównego, które zwykle jest chudym drobiem lub świeżą rybą. Czasami jem go z samym chlebem jako daniem głównym i daje mi to całkowitą satysfakcję.” — Sarah Galanis, MPH, CDN, dyrektor ds. żywności i żywienia w NYU Langone Hospital – Brooklyn\r\n\r\n## 2. Bakłażan Parmigiana\r\n\r\n„Moją ulubioną kulturalną potrawą jest – bez wątpienia – parmigiana z bakłażana, która jest zasadniczo zapiekanką z lekko panierowanych, smażonych plasterków bakłażana przełożonych sosem pomidorowym marinara i serem mozzarella. Najlepiej, jeśli bakłażan będzie chrupiący, a ser ugotowany dobrze wysmażony lub lekko przypalony. Wrzuć trochę świeżej bazylii i gotowe. Mieszanie smaków jest po prostu rewelacyjne.\r\n\r\nMoja mama zrobiłaby to jako danie klasyczne dla naszej włoskiej kultury. Jest w to zaangażowany proces etapów, na przykład „pocenia się” bakłażana, co oznacza krojenie go na krążki, lekkie ich solenie i umieszczanie na ręcznikach papierowych i między nimi, aby wyciągnąć solaninę – składnik, który nadaje bakłażanowi swój początkowy gorzki smak. Można go zjeść na kolację, ale resztki dobrze się podgrzają na lunch, a ja też jem resztki na śniadanie, kiedy nie miałem nic więcej. Kiedy byłam w ciąży z moim synem, mój mąż śmiał się z mojej otwartości na możliwości jedzenia – jak parmigiana z bakłażana na śniadanie.\r\n\r\nUwielbiam, że to danie można modyfikować na tak wiele sposobów. Możesz zrobić to w klasycznym stylu, smażąc plastry bakłażana, ale możesz też grillować lub piec, aby wybrać bardziej zdrową dla serca opcję; możesz zmienić rodzaj sosu lub sera; możesz nawet użyć cukinii zamiast bakłażana, jeśli masz alergię na bakłażany, lub użyj bezmlecznego sera i bezglutenowej bułki tartej, jeśli masz dodatkowe alergie pokarmowe lub nietolerancje. Możliwości są nieskończone.\" — DeLuca\r\n\r\n## 3. Gulasz\r\n\r\n„Pochodzę z wielu kultur (angielskiej, irlandzkiej, węgierskiej, ale głównie słoweńskiej), więc zawsze fajnie było patrzeć, jak moja mama gotuje z bardzo różnych kultur. Mój tata nie był zbyt żądny przygód, więc patrząc wstecz, często jedliśmy zdrowsze potrawy typu węgierskiego, takie jak gulasz. Gulasz, który zrobiła moja mama, był soczystą mieszanką wołowiny, warzyw i kminku – często nakładała je na makaron z masłem. W niedzielne popołudnia przychodzili dziadkowie i wszyscy razem jedliśmy. Moja mama często robiła to danie, ponieważ wydawało się, że wszystkim się to podoba – i szczerze mówiąc, próba gotowania dla tłumu może być bardzo droga, a to było niedrogie. Mój 98-letni dziadek poprosił o to na łożu śmierci, więc wystarczyło, aby pozostawić niezatarte wrażenie!\r\n\r\nMyślę, że to jedno z moich ulubionych dań, ponieważ przypomina mi kolacje, które jedliśmy, gdy byłam mała. Teraz, gdy robię to danie, często zastępuję dziczyznę wołowiną, tak jak osobista preferencja, która nie zmienia jej smaku. Chociaż często można ulepszyć przepis, aby był zdrowszy, podstawa dania powinna pozostać taka sama i powinna zostać przekazana bliskim, aby podtrzymać tradycję”. —Beth A. Czerwony, RD, zarejestrowany dietetyk w Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition\r\n\r\n## 4. Słodkie i pikantne słodkie ziemniaki\r\n\r\n„Słodkie ziemniaki to warzywo korzeniowe, które w mojej kulturze afroamerykańskiej przyrządza się na wiele sposobów. Słodkie ziemniaki – a konkretnie pieczone słodkie ziemniaki – są słodkie i pikantne, i jem je jako dodatek do obiadu. Po prostu pieczę je w piekarniku w temperaturze 400°F przez 30 do 40 minut, a kiedy już to zrobię, posypuję cynamonem, ugniatam widelcem i cieszę się smakiem. Pieczenie batatów w piekarniku nadaje im niesamowitą konsystencję i wydobywa ich słodki smak.\r\n\r\nSłodkie ziemniaki pojawiają się na świątecznych imprezach w wielu formach: pieczone, ubijane, w cieście, czy posypane piankami. I jesteś uważany za najlepszego szefa kuchni w mojej kulturze, jeśli potrafisz zrobić najlepsze ciasto lub danie ze słodkich ziemniaków. Przygotowywanie dań ze słodkich ziemniaków to odznaka honoru — tylko kilku członków rodziny może przynosić ciasto ze słodkich ziemniaków i kandyzowane bataty lub bataty na świąteczne spotkania. Również przepis na słodkie ziemniaki jest przekazywany z pokolenia na pokolenie. Każda rodzina ma swój własny zwrot.” — Nijya Saffo, MS, RDN, L.D.\r\n\r\n## 5. Ryż z leżakami\r\n\r\n„Moim ulubionym daniem jest arroz con gandules, słynne danie z ryżu portorykańskiego z niewielką ilością roślin strączkowych. Jem to danie od najmłodszych lat – nawet teraz, gdziekolwiek nie pójdziemy, wita nas talerz arroz con gandules. To podstawa wszelkich spotkań, uroczystości świątecznych lub specjalnych kolacji.\r\n\r\nNasz przepis zaczyna się od sosu sofrito i paczki przypraw sazon przed dodaniem gondoli. Możesz dodać zielone oliwki nadziewane ziele angielskie i kilka gałązek kolendry dla większego smaku, a ja bardzo lubię to danie z ryżem z dużą ilością zielonych oliwek. Niezależnie od przepisu, ten arroz con gandules jest zwykle podawany z tostonem (smażone zielone banany) lub maduritos (smażone dojrzałe banany) i liściem sałaty z kilkoma plasterkami pomidora. Mój ulubiony napój do tego posiłku to zazwyczaj Malta (bezalkoholowy napój jęczmienny). Żywność Latinx-Hispanic dostarcza nie tylko smaków i konsystencji, ale jest również pełna ważnych składników odżywczych, takich jak błonnik, zdrowe tłuszcze oraz kilka witamin i minerałów”. — Sylvia E Klinger, MS, R.D., C.P.T.\r\n\r\n## 6. Congee (napój)\r\n\r\n„Uwielbiam congee, znanego również jako żart! Jest to owsianka ryżowa, którą można zrobić po prostu z bulionu i ryżu i uzupełnić wszystkimi rodzajami dodatków – suszoną wieprzowiną, jajkiem na twardo lub herbatą, marynowanymi warzywami, zieloną cebulką, chili lub olejem sezamowym lub czymkolwiek, co masz w spiżarni. Congee to jedno z tych dań, które przyrządza każda chińska babcia, gdy nie jest ci dogodnie pogoda — podobnie jak rosół w kulturach zachodnich. Jest ciepły, wygodny i idealny w deszczowy dzień. Pragnę tego w zimie, kiedy chcę po prostu czegoś pocieszającego i ciepłego.\r\n\r\nZwykle ubijam to w moim Instant Pot – wrzucam tuszkę kurczaka z zamrażarki, następnie dodaję filiżankę ryżu, około 8 szklanek wody, imbir i mielone grzyby shiitake. Moje ulubione dodatki niekoniecznie są tradycyjne, ale uwielbiam dodawać smażone grzyby shiitake, jajko na miękko, olej sezamowy i chili oraz zieloną cebulkę”. — Leanna Tu, MS, R.D.N.\r\n\r\n## 7. Duszona Okra i Czarnooki Groszek\r\n\r\n„Nie lubię słodyczy. Uwielbiam pikantne, ziemiste, pełnosmakowe potrawy, a te (wraz z „trójcą zieleni”, jak to nazywają – rzepą, musztardą i kapustą warzywną z octem jabłkowym) to jedne z moich ulubionych dodatków dla niedzielnej rodziny posiłki. Dorastając na południu, moja rodzina posiadała ziemię, a mój tata uprawiał kilka rodzajów produktów i hodował bydło. Poznałem i lubię je jako podstawowe posiłki. Możesz je zjeść do obiadu lub obiadu, a nawet zjem czarnooki groszek do śniadania, jeśli mam kaszę i jajka. To tylko zależy od tego, jak się czuję.\r\n\r\nCzarnooki groszek jest łatwy i można go kupić luzem. Namocz je przez noc i ugotuj tak, jak robiła to moja mama w szybkowarze lub Instant Pot. Zwykle dostaję opcję zamrożoną i gotuję je na kuchence. Jeśli chodzi o warzywa, świeże smakuje mi lepiej niż w puszkach i jest mniej sodu. Lubię bulion warzywny, cebulę, czosnek, paprykę i trochę oliwy z oliwek z octem jabłkowym.” — YaQutullah Ibraheem Muhammad, MS, R.D.N., L.D.\r\n\r\n## 8. Brinjal Bharta\r\n\r\n„Bycie tyglem różnych kultur (pakistańskiej, włoskiej i polskiej) zawsze stanowiło rdzeń mojej tożsamości. Dorastając, miałem kontakt z różnymi pysznymi kulturowymi kuchniami, a moje dwie ulubione to jedno z najbardziej wszechstronnych warzyw – bakłażan. Podczas gdy parmigiana z bakłażana, z mojej włoskiej strony, jest na drugim miejscu, baingan bharta (curry z pieczonego bakłażana), z mojej pakistańskiej strony, jest moim ulubionym daniem wszechczasów. Baingan bharta jest zrobiona z pieczonego bakłażana i doprawiona najczęściej używanymi masala i przyprawami, takimi jak kolendra i kminek, a także pomidorami, cebulą i czosnkiem. Jest absolutnie przepyszny.\r\n\r\nBaingan bharta była jednym z głównych dań na wszystkich rodzinnych imprezach, które miałem u boku mojego pakistańskiego ojca. Uwielbiałam jeść z roti (podpłomykami), bo mogłam jeść rękoma i bez sztućców! Obecnie lubię baingan bharta z ryżem i doprawionym sosem ogórkowo-jogurtowym, znanym również jako raita. Mój mąż pochodzi z Trynidadu i to danie jest również popularne w jego kulturze – więc często je spożywamy! Przez jakiś czas bałem się zrobić własne curry z bakłażana, ale ponieważ jest to ulubieniec na całe życie, pomyślałem, że nadszedł czas, aby zacząć robić je od zera”. — Kalloo\r\n\r\n## 9. Od razu\r\n\r\n“Jestem perskim Amerykaninem – moi rodzice dorastali w Iranie i przeprowadzili się tutaj, gdy mieli niewiele ponad 20 lat – a chrupiący ryż jest moim ulubionym. Tachin to warstwowe danie z ryżu, które wygląda jak ciasto, a w środku jest przekładane szafranem, jogurtem, mieszanką jajek z ryżem i gotowanym kurczakiem. Wierzch tego „ciasta ryżowego” to prawie cały chrupiący ryż, przyozdobiony smażonymi berberysami, posiekanymi migdałami i pistacjami!\r\n\r\nWychowałem się na tym posiłku i zawsze mieliśmy go jako podstawę przy naszym stole, zwłaszcza na uroczystościach – to żywy dodatek i jest tak pełen smaku. Lubię łączyć kawałek tachin z dodatkiem zielonej sałaty liściastej lub sałatki shirazi (perska sałatka z ogórków, pomidorów i cebuli) lub opcjonalnym dodatkiem, który jest powszechny w kuchni perskiej, takim jak szalotka w zwykłym jogurcie lub świeżym pieczywie z serem feta, orzechami włoskimi i ziołami. Ponieważ jest to głównie danie z ryżu, można je połączyć z dowolnym głównym daniem. Ten posiłek nie musi być przygotowywany z kurczaka lub czerwonego mięsa — może być wegetariański (przyjazny dla lakto-owów, ponieważ nadal będzie zawierał jajka i jogurt) i można go połączyć z wybranym przez siebie białkiem roślinnym. Zachęcam wszystkich do spróbowania i uwielbiam zachęcać klientów i znajomych do próbowania nowych posiłków, zwłaszcza tych, które zawierają dużo ziół i przypraw”. — Yasi Ansari, MS, RDN, CSSD\r\n\r\n## 10. Pão de Queijo\r\n\r\n„Moja mama pochodzi z Brazylii, więc dorastałam, jeżdżąc do rodziny w Brazylii i mówiąc po portugalsku. Moim ulubionym jedzeniem z Brazylii jest pão de queijo, czyli chleb serowy, który poznałem jako małe dziecko w Brazylii. Pão de queijo jest miękkie, gumiaste i ma pyszny, łagodny, serowy smak z lekką, chrupiącą skórką na zewnątrz i miękkim wnętrzem.\r\n\r\nPão de queijo jest wszechstronna i może być spożywana z każdym posiłkiem lub przekąską, jak z piekarnika. Można go również pokroić i zjeść z dżemem, jako kanapkę z nadzieniem lub jako element pysznego śniadania z parującą filiżanką kawy. Ponieważ jest zrobiony z mąki z tapioki, pão de queijo jest również bezglutenowe. Zawsze mam w spiżarni mąkę z tapioki lub mrożone pão de queijo, które można szybko upiec na pyszny smakołyk”. —Sonya Angelone, MS, R.D.N.\r\n\r\n## 11. Muboora A Dovi\r\n\r\n„Jestem dziewczyną Shona z Zimbabwe, a moim ulubionym daniem kulturalnym jest muboora une dovi: liście dyni (których smak przypomina bardzo lekki szpinak) duszone w kremowym sosie z masła orzechowego. Czasami dodaje się ostrą papryczkę peri peri, aby trochę podgrzać danie.\r\n\r\nOrzechy ziemne i masło orzechowe odgrywają ważną rolę w kulturze żywności Zimbabwe; dodajemy je do wszystkiego, od śniadaniowej owsianki po ryż, mięso i warzywa. Orzechy ziemne i masło orzechowe są ważne dla podniesienia zarówno wartości odżywczych, jak i smaku żywności. A liście dyni są po prostu podstawą Zimbabwe. Moja mama wyhodowała je w swoim ogrodzie, a w sezonie często je jadaliśmy. Liście dyni zazwyczaj nie są sprzedawane w supermarketach w Stanach Zjednoczonych, ale miałem szczęście znaleźć je w niezależnych międzynarodowych sklepach i na lokalnych targowiskach. Jeśli hodujesz własne dynie, wybierz młode, delikatne liście, które są łatwiejsze w przygotowaniu i przyjemniejsze w ustach. (Oto przepis z instrukcją przygotowania liści dyni.) Z tym posiłkiem wiąże się duża nostalgia: jestem imigrantką, a muboora une dovi to danie pełne wspomnień z domu, ponieważ przenosi mnie do ogrodu mojej mamy i kuchnia.” — Cordialis Msora-Kasago, M.A., R.D.\r\n\r\n## 12. Rajma-Chawal\r\n\r\n„Jedną z moich ulubionych indyjskich potraw jest rajma-chawal: fasola (rajma) duszona w pysznym sosie z dodatkiem cebuli i pomidorów, podawana z białym ryżem (chawal). To prawie jak wegetariańskie chili.\r\n\r\nMoja szkolna stołówka w Madrasie w Indiach miała na lunch pyszne wegetariańskie jedzenie, chociaż zazwyczaj codziennie jadłam domowy obiad. Pewnego dnia zapomniałem o tym i musiałem go kupić w szkole. Po raz pierwszy spróbowałem rajmy i ryżu – było tak smaczne i satysfakcjonujące. Pobiegłem do domu i opowiedziałem o wszystkim mamie. Moja mama nie znała go, ponieważ pochodziła z innego stanu, ale była w stanie odtworzyć go dla nas w domu i stał się częścią naszej rodzinnej rotacji posiłków. Teraz nadal lubię robić to dla mojej rodziny. Aby uzyskać klasyczne połączenie, delektuj się rajmą z odrobiną zwykłego ryżu lub roti. Cały czas podaję ją naszej rodzinie i przyjaciołom, a w mojej książce mam prosty przepis na to danie *My Indian Table: Quick & Tasty Vegetarian Recipes**”* —Vandana Sheth, R.D.N., C.D.E.\r\n\r\n## 13. Barszcz\r\n\r\n„Jestem pół Rosjanką ze strony mamy, a ona robi pyszne danie o nazwie barszcz, czyli zupa z buraków, której przygotowanie może zająć około pół dnia. Jest pełen pysznych warzyw, takich jak buraki, kapusta, marchewka, cebula, pasternak, pory i ziemniaki, i gotowane w aromatycznym bulionie wołowym. Moja babcia z Rosji przekazała przepis mojej mamie, która w okresie zimowym robiła go w domu, dorastając w Kalifornii. (Zwykle jesz barszcz w chłodniejsze zimowe miesiące.)\r\n\r\nSmakuje mi z odrobiną kwaśnej śmietany i ciemnym pieczywem typu pumpernikiel. Bogaty smak chleba dopełnia wyrazistość zupy. Gotowanie barszczu sprawia, że ​​cały dom pachnie niesamowicie, ponieważ przez większość dnia gotuje się na kuchence. Zapach przywołuje wspomnienia babci, a teraz mamy, wspólnie jedzących posiłki w domu. Ma cudowną mieszankę smaków i można ją dostosować do własnych potrzeb żywieniowych. ” — Mia Syn, MS, R.D.N.\r\n\r\n## 14. Dim sum\r\n\r\n„Specjalnością kuchni kantońskiej jest dim sum, co jest ogólnym odniesieniem do małych potraw, które mogą być pikantne lub słodkie i zawsze są spożywane z herbatą. Wyobraź sobie małe talerze z kluskami, makaronem ryżowym i bułeczkami – to jak chińskie dania podawane w stylu tapas i popijanie herbaty na brunch!\r\n\r\nDorastając, pamiętam, jak chodziłem na dim sum z rodzicami i rodzeństwem. Był to centralny element uroczystości rodzinnych, kiedy mieliśmy gości i chińskie święta. Często nie ma menu, gdy jesz dim sum. Kelnerzy przychodzą z wózkiem na kółkach wypełnionym różnymi potrawami, które mają być dzielone przez cały stół. Nie ma ograniczeń co do liczby dań, które *powinnaś* wybrać, i zachęcamy do jedzenia, gdy dania trafiają na stół.\r\n\r\nRozmyślanie nad moim dim sum z przeszłości wywołuje nostalgię, a ciesząc się nią w teraźniejszości, nawiązuje do osób przy stole, chińskiej historii i tradycji. Pracowałem z kilkoma klientami, którzy szukają związku ze swoim chińskim dziedzictwem. Jedzenie to tylko jeden z najpotężniejszych sposobów wspierania tego *i* poczucia przynależności. Dim sum to świetna okazja, aby to odkryć!” — Laura Iu, R.D., CDN, R.Y.T.\r\n\r\n## 15. Jamajskie curry z kurczakiem\r\n\r\n„Jednym z moich ulubionych dań, które dorastałem, było curry z kurczaka mojego taty. Jest Jamajczykiem i gotował go na specjalne okazje. To danie gulaszowe z mocnymi smakami curry i kurkumy, a także ziemniakami i marchewką, dzięki czemu jest bardzo pożywne. To naprawdę pikantne danie z mnóstwem smaku i przypraw. Kiedyś robił to z ryżem i groszkiem, kolejnym daniem z Jamajki.\r\n\r\nMyślę, że kiedyś tak bardzo mi się podobało, ponieważ było przygotowywane na specjalne okazje, a to danie, które wydaje się łatwiejsze do zrobienia niż jest. Został również wykonany z miłością, co moim zdaniem naprawdę pomaga. Zawsze możesz zmienić poziom przypraw według własnych upodobań. Dla tych, którzy nie są przyzwyczajeni do smaków, może to być nabyty smak, ale zdecydowanie warto. Mój tata też nigdy nie robił tego dania dwa razy w ten sam sposób. Czasami dodawał więcej papryki, a nawet wkładał do naczynia szpinak”. — Shana Minei Spence, MS, RDN, CDN\r\n\r\n## 16. Sos Molcajeteada\r\n\r\n„Jednym z dań, które muszę jeść za każdym razem, gdy jestem w Meksyku, jest salsa molcajeteada mojej mamy, tradycyjna salsa z grillowanych jalapeños, cebuli i pomidora, wraz z sokiem z limonki, kminkiem, solą i pieprzem. Jedną z ważnych rzeczy przy przygotowywaniu salsy jest to, że robi się ją w molcajete (moździerzu przypominającym misę, tradycyjnie wyrzeźbionym w naturalnym kamieniu wulkanicznym). Robienie go w molcajete dodaje smaku i prezentacji. Smak, jaki uzyskuje, jest trudny do opisania, ale odróżnia go od innych sals.\r\n\r\nW mojej rodzinie jest idealnym towarzyszem carne asada (grillowany stek) i domowych tortilli kukurydzianych. Uwielbiam prostotę wszystkich składników, świeże smaki, pikantność i dodatkową warstwę smaku, która wnosi do carne asada. Ponieważ składniki są grillowane, zwykle jemy je świeże w dniu grillowania, ale robimy dodatkowe, aby dodać je do posiłków później następnego dnia. Smakuje jak dom i rodzina.” — Su-Nui Escobar, R.D.N.\r\n\r\n## 17. Tarty Jajeczne\r\n\r\n„Tarty jajeczne w stylu Hong Kongu były jednym z moich ulubionych deserów-ciastek. Za każdym razem, gdy każdego lata podróżowałem do moich dziadków za granicę do Chin, odwiedzaliśmy piekarnie, w których codziennie robili je świeże. Jest to zasadniczo łuszcząca się, przypominająca ciasto filiżanka wypełniona słodkim kremem jajecznym. Uwielbiam to, że jest mały i ma odpowiednią ilość słodyczy – jak mini ciasto! Z zewnątrz są ciepłe i chrupiące, ale gdy je wgryziesz, w środku są miękkie i słodkie. Moja mama również robiła je od podstaw, a ja uwielbiam wspaniałą domową tartę jajeczną.\r\n\r\nDla mnie to raczej deser, ale jest powszechnie podawany w restauracjach, które serwują dim sum. Można go jeść na ciepło lub na zimno, ale uwielbiam go świeżo upieczony, prosto z piekarnika! Takie wspólne danie może stworzyć tak wiele wspomnień. Jedzenie to o wiele więcej niż tylko pożywienie dla naszego ciała. Kulturowo służy zbliżeniu ludzi”. — May Zhu, MBA, RDN, LDN\r\n\r\n## 18. Collard Greens i Chleb Kukurydziany\r\n\r\n„Uwielbiam kapustę warzywną i chleb kukurydziany. Chociaż *możesz* jeść warzywa bez chleba kukurydzianego, wydaje mi się to niekompletne. W mojej rodzinie warzywa są powoli duszone z mięsem, tworząc pikantny bulion i delikatną zieleninę. Następnie dodajesz nakrętkę octu do swoich warzyw i zjadasz je razem z chlebem kukurydzianym.\r\n\r\nJadłem zieleninę odkąd pamiętam, zaczynając jako dziecko. Dorastając na południu mieliśmy dostęp do wielu niedrogich warzyw uprawianych na farmach lub na podwórku sąsiadów. Tak więc typowe jest, aby zobaczyć ogromne główki kapusty zielonej wiszące w kuchni, tylko czekające na umycie w dowolnym momencie. A proces zdobywania, czyszczenia, krojenia i gotowania zieleniny jest częścią tego doświadczenia.\r\n\r\nZielone są dla mnie wyjątkowe, ponieważ przypominają mi, jak siedziałem i patrzyłem, jak robi je moja babcia. To danie, które je każdy w mojej rodzinie. Zabierają czas, ale wysiłek jest tego wart. I możesz się założyć, że pod koniec dnia nie pozostanie. Teraz, jako osoba dorosła, która akurat jest zarejestrowanym dietetykiem, uwielbiam to, że dorastałam, jedząc tak pożywne jedzenie i nawet o tym nie wiedziałam”. — Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, L.D.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:17:03', '2021-03-10 19:30:54', '/resources/images/GettyImages-1301473267.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/favorite-cultural-foods', 0, 0);

Poprosiliśmy więc ludzi w całym kraju, aby podzielili się z nami swoimi listami zakupów, a następnie zadzwoniliśmy do kilku z nich, aby zapytać o więcej szczegółów. Dlaczego kupują to, co kupują? Ile wydają? Dla kogo kupują? O jakich stanach zdrowotnych lub kwestiach żywieniowych myślą, kiedy wybierają na przykład mleko migdałowe zamiast krowiego, czy konkretne smaki, przyprawy lub smakołyki? W tym odcinku Pamiętniki spożywcze słyszymy od zapalonego piekarza, który ma stan przedcukrzycowy i co wieczór je deser.*\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n**Imię:** Lissette Gomez\r\n**Wiek:** 50\r\n**Zawód:** Kierownik projektu\r\n**Lokalizacja:** Park Monterey, Kalifornia\r\n**Rasa/Płeć:** Latynoska kobieta\r\n**Warunki zdrowotne/ograniczenia dietetyczne do rozważenia:** Hipoglikemia (niski poziom cukru we krwi), stan przedcukrzycowy i cukrzyca w wywiadzie rodzinnym\r\n**Częstotliwość zakupów spożywczych:** zakupy dla dwóch osób cztery razy w miesiącu\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nLissette Gomez zawsze oszczędza miejsce na szklankę mleka, domowy deser i dwie kosteczki gorzkiej czekolady po obiedzie. „Lubię kończyć wieczór mocniejszym smakiem czekolady, a mleko jest bardzo kojące. Czuję, że to mnie odpręża, więc mogę spokojnie iść spać – mówi SELF.\r\n\r\nLissette w każdą niedzielę piecze nowy deser. Często robi bochenek na bazie owoców, ponieważ przypomina jej jedzenie słodkiego chleba w Salwadorze, gdzie się urodziła. „Tak dużo pieczę, bo w Salwadorze uprawia się kawę, więc lokalną tradycją jest picie kawy ze słodkim chlebem. Zachowałam słodkie pieczywo, ale dodałam składnik mleczny” – mówi. Lissette ma stan przedcukrzycowy, w rodzinie występuje cukrzyca typu 2 i doświadcza niskiego poziomu cukru we krwi (stan zwany hipoglikemią), gdy nie je przez kilka godzin. Dokłada wszelkich starań, aby do każdego posiłku – w tym deseru – dodać białko i błonnik, aby ustabilizować poziom cukru we krwi, w oparciu o zalecenie lekarza. Aby to osiągnąć, ogranicza węglowodany i w wielu swoich przepisach używa składników o dużej zawartości składników odżywczych. Na przykład Lissette zastępuje część cukru w ​​swoich przepisach na babeczki i chleb bananami, aby zwiększyć zawartość błonnika.\r\n\r\nWedług USA stan przedcukrzycowy ma miejsce, gdy poziom cukru we krwi jest wyższy niż typowy zakres, ale nie na tyle wysoki, aby można go było uznać za cukrzycę. Narodowa Biblioteka Medyczna. I chociaż każdy może doświadczyć spadku poziomu cukru we krwi po dłuższej przerwie w jedzeniu, osoby ze stanem przedcukrzycowym mogą być szczególnie predysponowane do tego rodzaju wahań, dlatego Lissette codziennie je przekąskę, aby mieć pewność, że tak się nie stanie. Oprócz kontrolowania stanu przedcukrzycowego Lissette stara się również jeść w sposób, który pomoże jej uniknąć rozwoju cukrzycy. Według Mayo Clinic istnieją dwa rodzaje cukrzycy, ale oba mogą prowadzić do stałego wysokiego poziomu cukru we krwi powyżej progu przedcukrzycowego. Z cukrzycą typu 2 (taką, która występuje w rodzinie Lissette) twoje ciało nie wykorzystuje wydajnie insuliny, hormonu regulującego poziom cukru we krwi. Kiedy tak się dzieje, twoje ciało nie może wytworzyć wystarczającej ilości insuliny, aby zrekompensować tę nieefektywność, co prowadzi do dodatkowego cukru we krwi. Wraz ze zmianami stylu życia, takimi jak aktywność fizyczna, stosowanie diety bogatej w składniki odżywcze i zwracanie uwagi na spożycie węglowodanów może pomóc w zapobieganiu progresji stanu przedcukrzycowego w cukrzycę. (Niektórzy ludzie mogą nawet odwrócić stan przedcukrzycowy za pomocą tego rodzaju zmian).\r\nMając to wszystko na uwadze, Lissette kupuje różnorodne produkty spożywcze, które odpowiadają jej gustom i potrzebom żywieniowym. Oto 10 przedmiotów, które odbiera podczas typowej wycieczki po sklepie spożywczym.\r\n\r\n1. Lindt Excellence 85% Ciemna Czekolada Kakaowa: 2,99 USD\r\n\r\n„Próbowałam innych marek, ale Lindt jest tak jedwabista i dobra”, mówi Lissette. „Rozpływa się w ustach. Nie udało mi się znaleźć niczego porównywalnego”. Lissette nigdy nie lubiła mlecznej czekolady i wcześniej jadła niesłodzoną czekoladę do pieczenia, zanim znalazła ten baton.\r\n\r\n2. Plantany: 0,50 USD\r\n\r\nJednym z ulubionych śniadań Lissette jest talerz bananów, fasoli i greckiego jogurtu, ponieważ uwielbia połączenie smaków. „Fasola jest słona, a banany naprawdę słodkie. Uwielbiam tę słono-słodką kombinację – mówi. Czasami robi zmodyfikowaną wersję canoas de platanos maduros, czyli mielonych bananów nadziewanych wołowiną, popularnego dania w Salwadorze. „Gotuję mieloną wołowinę i jem banany z boku jak ziemniaki” – mówi.\r\n\r\n3. Tortille z białej kukurydzy Guerrero: 1,79 USD?\r\n\r\n„Nie możemy zjeść posiłku bez tortilli. Będziesz się śmiać, ale w mojej rodzinie jemy nawet tortille ze spaghetti – mówi Lissette. Zjada dwie tortille dziennie, aby nadal cieszyć się jedzeniem, które uwielbia, jednocześnie zmniejszając spożycie węglowodanów. Zwykle używa ich fortacos, quesadillas lub szybkich okładów śniadaniowych. „Ser i awokado w tortilli ratują życie. Gotujesz go przez 30 sekund w kuchence mikrofalowej i jesteś gotowy do pracy” – mówi.\r\n\r\n4. Simple Truth Siemię Lniane Pełnoziemny: 3,79 $\r\n\r\nPrawie 15 lat temu, po tym, jak zdiagnozowano u niej wysoki poziom cholesterolu, Lissette zaczęła codziennie pić jedną łyżkę mielonego lnu zmieszaną z wodą. „Pamiętam, jak moja mama mówiła mi, że picie lnu pomaga z wysokim poziomem cholesterolu i od tamtej pory to robię” – mówi. Okazuje się, że matka Lissette miała rację. Według kliniki Mayo len jest doskonałym źródłem rozpuszczalnego błonnika i może pomóc obniżyć poziom cholesterolu i utrzymać stabilny poziom cukru we krwi. Chociaż nie ma już wysokiego cholesterolu, Lissette kontynuuje ten nawyk, a nawet dodaje len do swoich wypieków.\r\n\r\n5. Organic Valley Grassmilk Organiczne pełne mleko: 5,99 USD\r\n\r\n„Naprawdę kocham mleko — kocham wszystko, co nabiałowe” — mówi Lissette. Po obiedzie pije zwykłe pełne mleko lub robi z niego gorącą czekoladę do deseru. Najbardziej lubi pełne mleko, ponieważ jest bardziej satysfakcjonujące niż wersje o obniżonej zawartości tłuszczu. Jak wyjaśnia Lissette: „Jest taki kremowy i bogaty. Do kawy napiję się mleka, a tak naprawdę nie chcę kawy. Chcę tylko mleka!”\r\n\r\n6. Banany: 0,27 USD\r\n\r\n„Dużo używam bananów do moich wypieków i do robienia koktajli” – mówi Lissette. „Nie przepadam za supersłodkimi potrawami, a także czerpię składniki odżywcze z banana”. Zazwyczaj Lissette w swoich przepisach zastępuje banany porcją białego cukru trzcinowego. (W zależności od wielkości, jeden banan ma prawie trzy gramy błonnika i jeden gram białka, plus wapń i potas, według amerykańskiej Agencji ds. Żywności i Leków. Dla porównania cukier trzcinowy nie zawiera błonnika, białka, lub minerałów.) Banany są głównym składnikiem jej bogatej w składniki odżywcze wersji Kakaowych Kamyków. „Uwielbiam kakaowe kamyki. Moja wersja jest zrobiona z płatków owsianych, mleka, banana i odrobiny kakao w proszku. Gotuję to wszystko razem, aż mieszanina będzie naprawdę kremowa” – mówi.\r\n\r\n7. Dwa dobre zwykłe greckie jogurty: 1,50 $\r\n\r\n„Zakładam to na wszystko. Podaj nazwę, a ja dołożę do niej jogurt grecki. Dodaję łyżkę stołową do czegoś, a to daje mi kremową konsystencję, której pragnę” – wyjaśnia Lissette. Miesza grecki jogurt z mąką heroal i makaronem, dodaje odrobinę quesadilli lub miesza w swoich koktajlach. Jedną z jej ulubionych przekąsek jest mango, woda kokosowa i koktajl z greckiego jogurtu.\r\n\r\n8. Jarmuż dinozaurów: 1,99 USD?\r\n\r\nLissette używa jarmużu tylko w jednym celu: robieniu omletów. „Kiedyś robiłam omlet ze szpinakiem, ale szpinak nie smakuje jak nic. Jarmuż jest bardziej chrupiący. Jest bardziej mięsisty. Bardzo to lubię” – mówi. Zaczyna dzień od obfitego śniadania, takiego jak omlety z jarmużu, ponieważ białko i błonnik są satysfakcjonujące i utrzymują stabilny poziom cukru we krwi.\r\n\r\n9. Vital Farms Jaja hodowane na pastwiskach, duże: 6,49 USD\r\n\r\nChociaż Lissette je omlety rano, ponieważ są doskonałym źródłem białka, uważa, że ​​jajka najlepiej podawać wieczorem. „Właściwie wolę jajka na obiad niż na śniadanie. Są szybkim białkiem i są tak dobre”, wyjaśnia Lissette. Z jajek robi sałatki, smażony ryż i huevos rancheros, danie z tortilli, jajek i sosu pomidorowego. Według Lissette, Vital Farms sprzedaje najwspanialsze jajka, jakie kiedykolwiek widziała. „Żółtka są prawie pomarańczowe, są po prostu takie piękne”.\r\n\r\n10. Awokado: 1,25 USD\r\n\r\nWygląda na to, że w dzisiejszych czasach prawie wszyscy kochają awokado – ale nie Lissette. „Nie chodzi o to, że nie lubię awokado, ale gdyby awokado wyszło z sezonu na zawsze, byłabym w porządku” – mówi. Więc dlaczego je zjada? Ponieważ są dobrym źródłem jednonienasyconych kwasów tłuszczowych, które pomagają utrzymać niski poziom cholesterolu. Na ogół je awokado w sałatkach i mówi, że owoc jest dobrym substytutem majonezu. „Awokado sprawia, że ​​sałatka z tuńczyka jest naprawdę kremowa. To naprawdę działa — byłem zaskoczony, jak dobry jest”.\r\n\r\n*Wszystkie produkty prezentowane na SELF są niezależnie wybierane przez naszych redaktorów.

Te kuchenne konie robocze to marzenie wielu osób wykonujących wiele zadań, które pomogą Ci siekać, miksować, miksować i owszem — nawet wyrabiać ciasto — z szybkością i precyzją. Robot kuchenny w najprostszym ujęciu to po prostu gadżet wspierający podstawowe zadania, jakie podejmujemy w kuchni.\r\n\r\nPosiadanie narzędzia, które ułatwia gotowanie i przygotowywanie potraw, może mieć duży wpływ na to, jak myślimy o czasie spędzanym w kuchni. W rzeczywistości, gdy masz dość gotowania, praktyka przygotowywania posiłków za pomocą robota kuchennego jest czymś, co dietetyk Wendy Lopez, R.D., podkreśla jako jeden ze sposobów, w jaki możesz naprawdę się wesprzeć.\r\n\r\nZ drugiej strony robot kuchenny może pomóc w utrzymaniu rytuałów, które cię uziemiają. Autorka książek kucharskich, Elizabeth Barbone, założycielka Cook Fast Eat Well, uwielbia robić ciasto na pizzę w swoim robocie kuchennym. „Pizza w piątek wieczorem to święta tradycja w naszym domu”, mówi SELF. „Robot kuchenny szybko wytwarza gluten, dzięki czemu powstaje łatwe do żucia i lekkie ciasto”.\r\n\r\nOd ciasta na pizzę po przygotowanie posiłku, wybór najlepszego robota kuchennego wymaga przemyślenia sposobów, w jakie chcesz go wykorzystać. Czy chcesz wymienić swój blender na doładowany model typu „zrób to wszystko”? A może potrzebujesz po prostu czegoś małego, co możesz trzymać na blacie, aby szybko posiekać cebulę? Istnieją opcje, które zaspokoją każdą potrzebę. Aby pomóc nam zebrać jedne z najlepszych robotów kuchennych do podzielenia się z Tobą, poprosiliśmy kilku naszych ulubionych specjalistów od jedzenia, aby podzielili się swoimi przemyśleniami, wraz z wszelkimi wskazówkami i sztuczkami, które sprawią, że korzystanie z jednego z nich będzie jeszcze bardziej przydatne.\r\n\r\nWszystkie produkty prezentowane na SELF są niezależnie wybierane przez naszych redaktorów.

A ten solidny model z 14 filiżankami to zapewnia. Wykonuje podstawy siekania, krojenia, szatkowania, a nawet ugniatania — i to tylko ze standardowymi nasadkami. Jeśli chcesz spiralizować lub uzyskać idealną kostkę, jest do tego przywiązanie. Pomimo wszystkich jego możliwości, możesz być zaskoczony, że nie ma interfejsu cyfrowego — tylko dwa przyciski: jeden do pulsowania i jeden do ciągłego przetwarzania. I naprawdę to wszystko, czego potrzebujesz, bez względu na to, co przygotowujesz. W przypadku Barbone jej robot kuchenny musi to wszystko zrobić. „Poradzi sobie z mieleniem jednego ząbka czosnku * i * łatwo ubija ciasto na pizzę”. Jeśli rozmiar 14 filiżanek wydaje się ekstrawagancki, pamiętaj, że to narzędzie ma pomagać Ci w kuchni przez wiele lat – znacznie dłużej trzyletnia gwarancja — więc ten rozmiar oznacza, że ​​możesz zrobić w nim ciasto na pizzę, kiedy tylko zechcesz, nawet jeśli do tej pory używałeś go tylko do robienia pesto i sosów. Trener żywienia i biznesu Ashely Pardo dorastał, obserwując ją babcia używa tego właśnie robota kuchennego w kuchni (odziedziczyła nawet swój pierwszy!) i sięga po niego za każdym razem, gdy robi sosy, dipy czy purée. „Robot kuchenny tworzy nieco więcej tekstury niż szybkoobrotowy blender (jak Vitamix) i jest idealny do hummusu, pesto, tzatziki, chimichurri”. 219 USD W WALMART\r\n\r\n![img](https://media.self.com/photos/60369f4061906e338dd0c905/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/kitchenaid.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmazon2Mała i prosta opcja: KitchenAid Cordless 5-Cup Chopper Niezależnie od wielkości lub marki robota kuchennego, należy zwrócić uwagę na to, jak dobrze może on przetwarzać żywność. „Przed zakupem robota kuchennego sprawdź siłę silnika” — mówi Barbone. „Potrzebujesz robota kuchennego, który poradzi sobie z mieszaniem ciasta i mieleniem żywności na ładne, gładkie purée”. Chociaż mieszanie ciast nie jest czymś, co możesz zrobić w tym 5-kubkowym siekaczu firmy Kitchenaid, może to nie mieć większego znaczenia, jeśli szukasz czegoś, co pomoże ci siekać, miksować, ubijać i przecierać. Ten siekacz robi to wszystko bez konieczności podłączania, ponieważ jest zasilany akumulatorem litowo-jonowym, który wystarcza na posiekanie 40 cebul. Dla mieszkańców mieszkań z małą kuchnią i niewielką ilością miejsca na blacie lub szafce, oferuje to innowację pod względem wielkości, funkcji (życie bezprzewodowe zmienia zasady) i przechowywania. Na przykład wszystkie akcesoria do tego modelu są schowane w nasadce miski, gdy nie jest ona używana.

Robi wszystko, co powinien robić dobry robot kuchenny — sieka, kroi, przeciera i ugniata — ale bardzo cicho. Jest ulubieńcem szefa kuchni Nyeshy Arrington, który mówi, że ten ułatwia „przygotowanie składników z wyprzedzeniem, więc kiedy nadejdzie czas gotowania, masz energię, aby być tak kreatywnym, jak chcesz”. Mówiąc o byciu kreatywnym, jednym z ulubionych dodatków Arringtona do Breville Sous Chef jest French Fry Disk. „Zamieni każde warzywo w frytki” – mówi.

INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (53, 11, 'Recenzja_ Produkty terytorialne to jeden z najlepszych zestawów posiłków dla osób ze specjalnymi potrzebami żywieniowymi.md', 'Nutritious, chef-made meals for every kind of eater.', '﻿![SELF Certified](/resources/images/self-sertified.a8219d3a493929b6ab03987fa72e70cae329bf88.svg)\r\n\r\n![Territory Foods Review 2020 One of the Best Vegan Meal Delivery Services ](/resources/images/celebrity_chefs_feature%402x.jpg)\r\n\r\nDzięki uprzejmości marki\r\n\r\nPlusy\r\n\r\n- Nie wymaga pracy\r\n- Zaspokaja różnorodne potrzeby żywieniowe\r\n- Bezproblemowy proces dostosowywania\r\n- Skoncentruj się na żywności bogatej w składniki odżywcze i pochodzącej z bardziej zrównoważonych źródeł\r\n\r\nCons\r\n\r\n- Stosunkowo drogie\r\n- Dostępne tylko w kilku obszarach\r\n\r\nMniej więcej rok po pandemii otworzyłem coś, co wydaje się 12 000 puszek fasoli i pudełek makaronu. Kiedy więc pojawiła się możliwość sprawdzenia usługi dostarczania posiłków, byłem podekscytowany. Zestaw posiłków, który w ogóle nie wymaga gotowania? Zapisz mnie.\r\n\r\nTerritory Foods przyciągnęło mnie z kilku powodów (poza mile widzianą przerwą w gotowaniu). Firma reklamuje, że jej jedzenie jest przygotowywane przez zespół niezależnych kucharzy, którzy tworzą posiłki we własnych komercyjnych kuchniach i restauracjach, w przeciwieństwie do centralnego ośrodka będącego własnością firmy gastronomicznej znajdującej się w innym mieście, gdzie działa wiele usług związanych z zestawami posiłków.\r\n\r\nMoją uwagę przykuło również położenie nacisku na terytoria na wysokiej jakości składniki. W dużej mierze opiera się na składnikach, które są wysoce odżywcze (cała żywność bogata w niezbędne składniki odżywcze, takie jak warzywa, produkty pełnoziarniste lub ryby) i są pozyskiwane w sposób bardziej zrównoważony, jeśli to możliwe. Na przykład wykorzystuje głównie jaja bez klatek, mięso bez hormonów, ryby złowione na wolności lub hodowane w zrównoważony sposób oraz, jeśli to możliwe, produkty ekologiczne i / lub lokalne.\r\n\r\nMam kilka odpowiednich preferencji żywieniowych (coś, do czego Territory bardzo dobrze pasuje): Nie jestem surowym weganinem, ale unikam produktów pochodzenia zwierzęcego, gdy tylko mogę — zawsze, gdy robię zakupy i gotuję dla siebie lub zamawiam jedzenie w miejsce, które ma opcje wegańskie. Mam też cukrzycę typu 1, co oznacza, że ​​moje ciało nie wytwarza insuliny (hormonu, który przenosi węglowodany z krwiobiegu do komórek w celu magazynowania energii). Dlatego podaję sobie insulinę w porze posiłków przez pompę insulinową. Chociaż *technicznie* mogę jeść tyle węglowodanów, ile chcę, pod warunkiem, że dopasowuję do nich wystarczającą ilość insuliny, generalnie staram się trzymać poniżej 50-60 gramów na posiłek, aby uniknąć skoków cukru we krwi – i zawierać dużą ilość błonnika, białka i tłuszcz (jak wiele osób ogólnie poszukujących posiłków zbilansowanych pod względem odżywczym).\r\n\r\nKolejna część ich modelu biznesowego, którą doceniłem: Inicjatywa firmy o nazwie TerritoryServes umożliwia kupowanie i przekazywanie posiłków pracownikom pierwszej linii, głównie w służbie zdrowia. Za każde dwa posiłki, które podajesz, przekazuje trzecią.\r\n\r\nOceniłem swoje doświadczenie z Territory Foods na podstawie naszego przewodnika kupowania zestawów posiłków. Oto jak to poszło.\r\n\r\n**Dostosowywanie**\r\n\r\nPoziom dostosowania na danym terytorium i proces wyboru posiłków są doskonałe. Do wyboru jest około 45 pozycji tygodniowo, z których większość to obiad i kolacja. Istnieje również garść śniadań i składników rodzinnych posiłków à la carte, w tym rodzinne dodatki wegetariańskie (takie jak tłuczone ziemniaki) i dania główne białkowe (takie jak łosoś z suszonymi pomidorami), zazwyczaj oferujące około trzech lub czterech porcji. Jest też kilka wypieków (takich jak paleo krówkowe brownie) i kawa cold brew.\r\n\r\nJeśli posiadanie tak wielu opcji wydaje się przytłaczające, nie obawiaj się — możesz szybko zmniejszyć swoje opcje za pomocą wielu precyzyjnych, łatwych do ustawienia filtrów:\r\n\r\n- **Dieta:** Terytorium oferuje 10 (!) różnych filtrów diet – w tym wegańskie, wegetariańskie i śródziemnomorskie, a także modne diety odchudzające, takie jak Paleo, Keto i Whole30 – choć możesz również odmówić wybrania preferencji.\r\n- **Składniki, których chcesz unikać:** Istnieją dziesiątki opcji – kolendra, orzechy, skorupiaki, ser wegański, grzyby, rośliny strączkowe, soja – co pozwala uzyskać dość specyficzne i jest idealne dla wybrednych i osoby z alergiami pokarmowymi lub wrażliwością.\r\n- **Smak:** Quiz o prostym smaku wpłynie na to, które posiłki są Ci bardziej polecane. Możesz także wybrać posiłki od konkretnego szefa kuchni, którego jedzenie lubisz.\r\n- **Styl posiłku:** Możesz poszukać śniadania, obiadu/kolacji i/lub à la carte.\r\n- **Profil żywieniowy:** możesz wybrać tylko posiłki o ściśle określonym zakresie makroskładników (na przykład posiłki od 30 do 60 gramów węglowodanów z co najmniej 20 gramami białka i 15 gramami tłuszczu). Możesz także sortować posiłki od niskiego do wysokiego według ilości węglowodanów lub białka, które zawierają. Inną przydatną funkcją jest to, że strona z galerią posiłków wyświetla kluczowe informacje żywieniowe (kalorie, węglowodany, białko, tłuszcze) dla każdego posiłku bez konieczności przechodzenia do poszczególnych stron. Ułatwiło mi to unikanie posiłków niskokalorycznych lub wysokowęglowodanowych.\r\n\r\nW oparciu o wybrane ustawienia Territory zasugeruje menu, które można niezwykle łatwo edytować zgodnie z własnymi upodobaniami. Podczas gdy bawiłem się różnymi filtrami, aby zobaczyć, jak działają, jedynym filtrem, którego faktycznie użyłem, był filtr wegański. Posiłkami, na które skończyłem, były:\r\n\r\n-Berbere Split Groszek z Brązowym Ryżem i Wegetariańską Mieszanką\r\n-Śródziemnomorskie Tofu z Rozmarynem i Ryżem Basmati\r\n-Tofu Fajitas z ryżem kalafiorowym i sosem ranchero\r\n-Wegańska lasagne z bakłażana z brokułami i migdałami\r\n- Warzywny Pot Pie Gulasz z Ziemniakami Puree Z Oliwek\r\n-Ciecierzyca w stylu północnoafrykańskim z marchewką w glazurze morelowej i miętową komosą ryżową\r\n-Tofu z czerwonego kokosowego curry z warzywami\r\n-Wegańska Paella po hiszpańsku RightRice z pieczarkami\r\n\r\nZ ciekawości przeszukałam też niektóre opcje niewegańskie i brzmiały tak samo smacznie (i zapakowane w warzywa!) jak moje wybory – jak ciastka z tuńczykiem w pistacjowej panierce z sałatką z kopru włoskiego lub grecką miskę kurczaka z cytrynowym ryżem estragonowym .\r\n\r\nJedynym miejscem, w którym napotkałem problemy z wyborem, było śniadanie, ale w rzeczywistości nie było to dla mnie wielkim rozczarowaniem, ponieważ generalnie lubię trzymać się podstaw.\r\n\r\n**Przystępność**\r\n\r\nPójdę dalej i powiem: te posiłki nie są tanie. Standardowe opcje, o których mówi się, że są „właściwą” pomocą dla większości ludzi” – stwierdziłem, że to prawda – zaczynają się od 13,95 USD za sztukę. Wszystkie moje posiłki kosztowały tyle, ale wiele dań mięsnych i rybnych było droższych, od 15,50 do 18,95 USD. Możesz także zmniejszyć i zamówić mniejszy „wzmocniony” rozmiar posiłku za 10,95 USD, przeznaczony dla „lżejszych jedzących i pasących się”. (Nie ja.)\r\n\r\nIm więcej zamówisz, tym więcej zaoszczędzisz. Możesz wybrać plan 10 lub 18 posiłków (który daje Ci jeden darmowy) lub wybrać zamówienie cykliczne (co pozwala zaoszczędzić 5% na tygodniowym zamówieniu).\r\n\r\nPracując z 13,95 USD za posiłek, plasują się one na szczycie surowego przedziału cenowego, na przykład, jeśli chodzi o porcję wielkości posiłku HomeChef. Wyższa cena jest zgodna z droższymi składnikami ekologicznymi i pochodzącymi z bardziej zrównoważonych źródeł oraz z faktem, że cała praca jest wykonywana za Ciebie. Co więcej, ta odmiana jest na wagę złota — bez dużych partii, powtarzających się posiłków i nudy.\r\n\r\nChociaż Territory nie jest najtańszą opcją zestawu posiłków, jest to przyzwoita oferta w porównaniu z jedzeniem na wynos (co kosztuje średnio od 20 do 25 USD, w tym podatki, opłaty za dostawę i napiwki). Mogę jednak uzyskać więcej kilometrów na wynos, ponieważ zwykle mogę liczyć na resztki.\r\n\r\n**Proces zamówienia i dostawy**\r\n\r\nMożesz zamówić kilka lub wiele przedmiotów, które lubisz w ciągu tygodnia, korzystając z niestandardowego planu Territory lub skorzystać z wstępnie ustawionego planu 10 lub 18 posiłków. Bardzo łatwo jest znaleźć opcje pominięcia tygodnia dostawy lub całkowitego wstrzymania subskrypcji. Możesz też zamówić dostawę posiłków w niedzielę, środę lub obie. (Różne posiłki są dostępne w różne dni.) Obecnie firma dostarcza produkty do głównych miast, takich jak moja baza w Nowym Jorku, obszar metra DC, Bay Area i Houston.\r\n\r\nZdecydowałem się na niestandardowy plan obejmujący osiem posiłków rozłożonych na oba dni dostawy, dzięki czemu moje posiłki będą krócej leżeć w lodówce. Obie dostawy przebiegły bezproblemowo, a ja dostałem e-maila z powiadomieniem, kiedy jedzenie jest gotowe i kiedy dotarło, co było miłe. Żywność była dostarczana w pojemnikach nadających się do recyklingu, kompostowalnych papierowych tackach i plastikowych pokrywkach oraz pakowana w żelowe opakowania z lodem, aby było wystarczająco zimno. Z jednego z pojemników wylało się trochę płynu, ale jest to na tyle powszechne przy dostawie, że nie przeszkadzało mi to zbytnio.\r\n\r\n**Łatwość użycia**\r\n\r\nAch, najprostsza rzecz w Territory Foods. Ludzie, którzy wolą gotować i ci, którzy lubią śpiewać do kolacji, szukają gdzie indziej – „przygotowanie” jedzenia zajęło mi około dwóch minut.\r\n\r\nWszystkie posiłki były opatrzone prostymi instrukcjami dotyczącymi podgrzewania kuchenki mikrofalowej i kuchenki — w zasadzie podgrzewanie przez jedną lub dwie minuty, mieszanie raz lub dwa razy. Eksperymentowałem z kilkoma różnymi metodami: podgrzewanie jedzenia w kuchence mikrofalowej bezpośrednio w pojemniku, a następnie jedzenie poza pojemnikiem lub na talerzu; platerowanie, a następnie podgrzewanie w kuchence mikrofalowej; i gotowanie w rondlu, a następnie platerowanie. Nie zauważyłem żadnej różnicy w smaku ani konsystencji w zależności od zastosowanej metody gotowania. Posiłkom towarzyszy również data „najlepszego jedzenia do” w oparciu o to, jak dobrze trzymają się składniki. (Wszystkie są dobre przez trzy dni od daty dostawy – potem możesz je zamrozić).\r\n\r\n**Profil żywieniowy**\r\n\r\nDużym punktem marketingowym Territory Foods jest to, że nie zawiera glutenu i nabiału – co jest świetne dla osób z celiakią, alergią na pszenicę lub nietolerancją laktozy – a także rafinowanego cukru. Te składniki nie są czymś, czego większość innych ludzi nie powinna unikać (cukier rafinowany nie jest zły!), ale mogą być plusem, jeśli z jakiegoś powodu odchodzisz.\r\n\r\nFirma *dostrzega*, że żywność jest wytwarzana w kuchniach, w których mogą być obecne gluten, nabiał i inne alergeny, co może być powodem do niepokoju na przykład dla kogoś z ciężką celiakią lub ciężką alergią na orzechy.\r\n\r\nNajczęstszymi składnikami zamówionych przeze mnie wegańskich posiłków były warzywa (szeroka gama, od liściastych po korzeń), produkty pełnoziarniste, fasola i rośliny strączkowe oraz białka roślinne (mianowicie tofu), a także trochę orzechów i wegan na bazie orzechów sery.\r\n\r\nUważam, że moje posiłki są całkiem dobrze zbilansowane i sycące, z przyjemną mieszanką węglowodanów, białka i tłuszczu. Standardowe posiłki zawierają średnio od 450 do 600 kalorii, podczas gdy lżejsze posiłki i przekąski mają od 250 do 450 kalorii. Zauważyłem jednak pewną zmienność, szczególnie wśród opcji niewegańskich – na przykład ciastka keto z tuńczykiem z pistacjami, sałatką coleslaw i sosem pesto miały 739 kalorii, podczas gdy standardowe posiłki były bliższe 300. Duża różnica w kaloryczności za każdą złotówkę! Ale z drugiej strony Territory polega na zaspokojeniu twoich potrzeb żywieniowych, a ponieważ możesz łatwo wybrać minimalną liczbę kalorii i więcej, nie powinno to stanowić problemu.\r\n\r\n**Smak**\r\n\r\nW większości moje posiłki były całkiem smaczne i satysfakcjonujące. Prawie wszystko było dobrze przyprawione, odpowiednio przyprawione i nic nie było rozgotowane – nie ma tu papkowatych, niedosolonych warzyw – ale nie miałbym nic przeciwko odrobinie więcej smaku w kilku daniach, ponieważ mam tendencję do podwajania przypraw i ziół w przepisie wymaga.\r\n\r\nNiesamowicie było też znaleźć dania z różnych kuchni – zawsze było coś, co pasowało do mojego nastroju, siedząc w lodówce. I zdecydowanie doceniłam mieszankę dań „oczywiście wegańskich” (takich jak dania na bazie tofu) i „przypadkowo wegańskie” (takie jak dania na bazie zbóż i fasoli).\r\n\r\nJedynym brakiem było śródziemnomorskie tofu z warzywami i daniem z ryżu, które było przesolone, brakowało większości obiecanych warzyw kapusty i zawierało kilka nieprzyjemnie twardych, chrząstkowatych kawałków tofu.\r\n\r\n** Dolna linia **\r\n\r\nChyba nie zdawałem sobie sprawy, jak bardzo potrzebowałem (no dobra, chciałem) przerwy od gotowania, dopóki nie pojawiło się moje pierwsze pudełko z gotowymi posiłkami. Od początku pandemii rzadko zamawiałam dania na wynos – naprawdę tylko przy specjalnych okazjach, takich jak spotkanie z przyjacielem lub pod koniec szczególnie ciężkiego tygodnia. Naprawdę lubię gotować dla siebie przez większość czasu, ale czasami mnie to męczy. Szczerze zapomniałam, jak cudownie jest *nie* gotować wszystkiego, co jesz.\r\n\r\nOgólnie rzecz biorąc, Territory Foods oferuje jedne z najlepszych cech dań na wynos – mianowicie wygodę i różnorodność – jednocześnie unikając niektórych jego wad. Po pierwsze, czasami naprawdę przytłaczająca liczba opcji w Nowym Jorku. (Wiem, śmieszne jest narzekanie! Ale kiedy jestem na granicy głodu i uderza mnie paraliż decyzyjny, jest to problem.) Terytorium usunęło również czasami długi i nieprzewidywalny czas dostawy; koszt opłat, podatków i napiwków; i brak faktów żywieniowych. Jedzenie było również smaczne, bardzo dostosowane do moich potrzeb żywieniowych i dość sycące. Podsumowując, jeśli szukasz wszechstronnej, bogatej w składniki odżywcze alternatywy na wynos, Territory Foods to bardzo solidny wybór.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:20:21', '2021-03-10 19:35:51', '/resources/images/celebrity_chefs_feature@2x.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/review/territory-foods-meal-kit', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (54, 11, 'Co to jest dieta zdrowa dla serca i co to znaczy jeść dla zdrowia serca.md', 'It doesn’t need to be complicated.', '﻿![What Is HeartHealthy Diet These 7 Simple Eating Tips Can Protect Your Heart](https://media.self.com/photos/6014440741347be6b3a5adfe/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/veggies_healthy_eating.jpeg)Criene Images/Adobe Stock\r\n\r\n„Zdrowe” odżywianie może być mylące, więc dość często zastanawiamy się, czym tak naprawdę jest dieta zdrowa dla serca. Ale to naprawdę ważny temat do zbadania. Według Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) choroby serca zabijają więcej Amerykanów niż jakakolwiek inna przyczyna. A to, co jesz, może w rzeczywistości odgrywać w tym dużą rolę: w jednym z badań opublikowanych w *JAMA* z 2017 r. naukowcy oszacowali, że pewne nawyki żywieniowe (takie jak stałe spożywanie dużej ilości sodu lub niedobór warzyw) mogą przyczyniać się do około 45% zgonów z chorób kardiometabolicznych, które obejmują choroby serca, udary i cukrzycę typu 2.\r\n\r\nAby zrozumieć, dlaczego to, co jesz, jest tak ważne, warto przyjrzeć się bliżej funkcji najważniejszego paska. Twoje serce jest epicentrum twojego ciała, pompując bogatą w tlen krew przez twoje tętnice do reszty ciebie. Kiedy tętnice zwężają się lub zatykają, stan znany jako choroba wieńcowa serca, odcinają krew do serca, zagrażając całemu narządowi.\r\n\r\nTwoim głównym celem jest utrzymanie giętkich i niezatkanych naczyń krwionośnych, aby krew mogła swobodnie płynąć. A to, co jesz, odgrywa rolę w określaniu stopnia nagromadzenia lub przejrzystości w tych naczyniach. Jest jednak wiele do rozpakowania, jeśli chodzi o związek między jedzeniem a zdrowiem serca. Oto, co musisz wiedzieć.\r\n\r\n## 1. Dieta zdrowa dla serca nie musi być naprawdę restrykcyjna *dieta.*\r\n\r\nKiedy wyobrażasz sobie dietę zdrową dla serca, możesz pomyśleć o dużej misce zwykłych płatków owsianych lub życiu bez masła. Prawda jest taka, że ​​jedzenie dla zdrowia serca nie polega na skupianiu się na jednym (lub kilku) pokarmach lub całkowitym unikaniu niektórych. Chodzi bardziej o spożywanie pokarmów, które są korzystne na wiele sposobów i ustalanie wzorców, których możesz się trzymać, aby z czasem chronić swoje serce.\r\n\r\n„Konsekwencja jest naprawdę najważniejsza, a nie robienie czegoś, co jest bardzo restrykcyjne” – mówi SELF dr Kurt M. Hong, profesor medycyny klinicznej i dyrektor wykonawczy Center for Clinical Nutrition na USC.\r\n\r\nRozważ swoją dietę jako element prewencyjnego podejścia do zapobiegania chorobie wieńcowej serca, a także do obniżenia czynników jej ryzyka, takich jak wysokie ciśnienie krwi i wysoki poziom cholesterolu, które mogą przyczyniać się do wczesnych zawałów serca i udarów, mówi dr Hong. Aby uzyskać najlepsze wyniki, połącz swój plan żywieniowy z ćwiczeniami, które utrzymują giętkie naczynia krwionośne i pomagają zmniejszyć stan zapalny. „Ludzie, którzy regularnie ćwiczą, radzą sobie znacznie lepiej, jeśli chodzi o zdrowie serca”, mówi dr Hong.\r\n\r\nByć może słyszałeś już o niektórych planach żywieniowych mających na celu zdrowie serca, w tym o diecie śródziemnomorskiej (bogatej w produkty pełnoziarniste, orzechy, nasiona, owoce, warzywa i oczywiście oliwę z oliwek) oraz dietetycznym podejściu do zatrzymania nadciśnienia tętniczego (DASH). plan (duży w produktach pełnoziarnistych oraz owocach i warzywach bogatych w potas). Chociaż są to poparte dowodami plany dotyczące zdrowej diety, pomysł przestrzegania „diety” może nie być najbardziej atrakcyjny na dłuższą metę. Zamiast tego możesz wykorzystać niektóre z ich taktyk – wraz z innymi komponentami popartymi badaniami – i wykorzystać je do stworzenia bardziej ogólnego przewodnika po tym, jak jeść, aby najlepiej promować zdrowie serca.\r\n\r\n## 2. Nie musisz unikać całego tłuszczu.\r\n\r\nUtrzymanie zdrowego serca nie oznacza automatycznego usuwania tłuszczu. „Tłuszcz jest ważnym makroskładnikiem odżywczym, który powinien być obecny w naszej diecie” – mówi SELF dr Rafaela G. Feresin, adiunkt żywienia na Georgia State University. Twoje ciało wykorzystuje tłuszcz do pozyskiwania energii, wchłaniania składników odżywczych i ochrony narządów. \r\n\r\nZamiast tego zastanów się nad położeniem nacisku na niektóre źródła tłuszczów nad innymi.\r\n\r\nNależy rozważyć ograniczenie spożycia tłuszczów nasyconych (znajdujących się głównie w mięsie, wieprzowinie, drobiu i produktach mlecznych) oraz tłuszczów trans (który występuje naturalnie w mięsie i produktach mlecznych oraz jest sztucznie wytwarzany w smażonych i pieczonych produktach), mówi dr Feresin.\r\n\r\nKiedy jesz zbyt dużo tych tłuszczów, możesz zwiększyć produkcję cholesterolu i aktywować komórki zapalne, które mogą pomóc temu cholesterolowi zagnieździć się w tętnicach, potencjalnie prowadząc do blokad. Podczas gdy niektóre ostatnie badania sugerują, że związek między tłuszczami nasyconymi w diecie a ryzykiem dla serca jest bardziej skomplikowany niż kiedyś sądzono, wytyczne dietetyczne w USA nadal zalecają, aby mniej niż 10% twoich dziennych kalorii pochodziło z tłuszczów nasyconych. A jeśli masz już wysoki poziom cholesterolu, American Heart Association (AHA) zaleca utrzymywanie tłuszczów nasyconych na poziomie zaledwie 5-6% całkowitych dziennych kalorii. (Dowody są dość jasne na temat tłuszczów trans – minimalizuj je tak bardzo, jak to możliwe. Amerykańska Agencja ds. Żywności i Leków zabroniła nawet sztucznie produkowanych tłuszczów trans i są one stopniowo wycofywane z żywności.)\r\n\r\nZ drugiej strony, tłuszcze jednonienasycone i wielonienasycone mają odwrotny wpływ niż tłuszcze nasycone i tłuszcze trans na poziom cholesterolu i ryzyko chorób sercowo-naczyniowych, mówi dr Feresin. W rzeczywistości, zgodnie z zaleceniem prezydenta AHA opublikowanym w *Circulation***, zastąpienie tłuszczów nasyconych tłuszczami nienasyconymi może zmniejszyć ryzyko chorób sercowo-naczyniowych w stopniu podobnym do leczenia statynami.\r\n\r\nBogate źródła tłuszczów jednonienasyconych obejmują awokado, oliwki, awokado i oliwę z oliwek – znowu witaj dieta śródziemnomorska. Źródła tłuszczów wielonienasyconych obejmują kwasy tłuszczowe omega-3 i omega-6, które można znaleźć w nasionach słonecznika, siemieniu lnianym lub oleju lnianym, orzechach włoskich i rybach. A te kwasy omega-3 mogą być szczególnie ochronne: nie tylko pomagają stabilizować postęp blaszek miażdżycowych, które mogą zatykać naczynia serca, ale także działają przeciwzapalnie, mówi dr Hong – a sam przewlekły stan zapalny jest niezależnym czynnikiem ryzyka choroba serca. Jedz ryby co najmniej dwa razy w tygodniu, mówi AHA. Jeśli jesteś weganinem lub wegetarianinem, możesz popracować nad dostarczaniem tych kwasów omega-3 poprzez takie rzeczy jak siemię lniane lub nasiona chia. \r\n\r\nOgólnie rzecz biorąc, najlepiej jest zaopatrywać się w kwasy omega-3 z naturalnych źródeł żywności, a nie z suplementów. \r\n\r\n„Nigdy nie wiemy, jak są wchłaniane suplementy”, mówi dr Hong. Ponadto suplementy mogą dawać fałszywe poczucie bezpieczeństwa i prowadzić do mniej zbilansowanej diety. Nie są one również regulowane przez amerykańską Agencję ds. Żywności i Leków (FDA), tak jak leki, więc nie możesz być dokładnie pewien, co otrzymujesz.\r\n\r\n## 3. Jedz więcej pokarmów bogatych w błonnik.\r\n\r\nWiększość Amerykanów nie spełnia zalecanego dziennego spożycia błonnika, formy węglowodanów – najlepiej byłoby, gdyby na każde 1000 spożywanych kalorii przyjmowano 14 gramów.\r\n\r\nMoże to stanowić problem, ponieważ błonnik, trudne do strawienia składniki żywności, takiej jak owoce, warzywa, rośliny strączkowe i produkty pełnoziarniste, mogą pomóc Twojemu sercu na wiele sposobów. Po pierwsze, błonnik może obniżyć poziom cholesterolu, co może sprawić, że tętnice będą czystsze, mówi dr Hong. Błonnik może również pomóc w regulacji poziomu cukru we krwi, co jest ważne, ponieważ przewlekły wysoki poziom cukru we krwi może narazić Cię na ryzyko cukrzycy i zwiększyć ryzyko zawału serca, udaru mózgu i innych problemów z sercem – mówi. (Cukrzyca jest również czynnikiem ryzyka problemów, takich jak zawał serca).\r\n\r\nBłonnik może również pomóc w uprawie lepszej, bardziej zróżnicowanej społeczności bakterii w jelitach, co ostatecznie może przyczynić się do zmniejszenia stanu zapalnego w całym ciele, w tym w układzie sercowo-naczyniowym, mówi dr Hong.\r\n\r\nDo tego dochodzi fakt, że naturalnie bogate w błonnik pokarmy, takie jak produkty pełnoziarniste, zawierają dodatkowe pomocne składniki odżywcze. Większość produktów pełnoziarnistych zawiera witaminy z grupy B i minerały, takie jak selen i magnez, mówi dr Feresin, które pomagają organizmowi regulować ciśnienie krwi, zapobiegać uszkodzeniom komórek i nie tylko.\r\n\r\nJeśli szukasz sposobów na dodanie błonnika, dr Feresin zaleca wybór makaronu pełnoziarnistego lub makaronu z brązowego ryżu zamiast zwykłego makaronu, brązowego ryżu zamiast białego ryżu, chleba pełnoziarnistego zamiast białego chleba, pełnoziarnistych płatków owsianych i pełnego owsa . Wypróbuj pseudo pełnoziarniste amarantus, nasiona chia i komosę ryżową. Dodaj quinoę do sałatki lub nasion chia do jogurtu lub płatków owsianych na noc, radzi. Owoce i warzywa bogate w błonnik to maliny, gruszki, jabłka (ze skórką), banany, zielony groszek, brokuły i brukselka.\r\n\r\n## 4. Obserwuj spożycie sodu.\r\n\r\nSód jest niezbędnym minerałem, który pomaga kontrolować równowagę płynów w organizmie. Szczerze mówiąc, pomaga też naprawdę świetnie smakować wielu potrawom. Jednak większość z nas konsekwentnie przyjmuje więcej sodu niż potrzebujemy – i to chroniczne nadmierne spożycie może stać się problemem dla twojego serca. To może oznaczać więcej płynu w naczyniach krwionośnych, potencjalnie prowadząc do wzrostu ciśnienia krwi, co może sprawić, że serce będzie musiało ciężej pracować, aby pompować krew w całym ciele, mówi dr Feresin.\r\n\r\nAby obniżyć ciśnienie krwi, AHA zaleca spożywanie nie więcej niż 2300 mg sodu dziennie. Jak mówi dr Hong, żywność w puszkach, konserwy i posiłki restauracyjne mogą być szczególnie bogate w sód. Podobnie jak przetworzone mięso, takie jak hot dogi, salami, kiełbasa i szynka. Chociaż są pyszne, połączenie sodu i tłuszczów nasyconych w tych mięsach, zwłaszcza jeśli są często spożywane z biegiem czasu, sprawia, że ​​są one dość niesmaczne dla zdrowia serca, mówi dr Hong. W rzeczywistości głównym źródłem sodu i tłuszczów nasyconych w amerykańskiej diecie są kanapki. Co niekoniecznie oznacza, że ​​musisz na zawsze zrezygnować z kanapek, ale dobrze jest wiedzieć, czy starasz się jeść w sposób, który wspiera optymalne zdrowie serca.\r\n\r\nRównie ważne, jak zmniejszenie spożycia sodu, jest zwiększenie spożycia potasu, minerału, który równoważy sód w regulowaniu równowagi płynów, mówi dr Feresin. Przeciętny Amerykanin spożywa znacznie mniej niż zalecana ilość 4700 mg dziennie.\r\n\r\nZnajdź potas w morelach, suszonych śliwkach, pomarańczach, dyni, szpinaku, pomidorach, szparagach, fasoli, soczewicy, mleku, jogurcie, kurczaku, indyku, wołowinie, łososiu i nie tylko, mówi dr Feresin. Aby dodać smaku potrawom bez posypywania ich dodatkową solą, spróbuj dodać przyprawy, takie jak zioła, ostre przyprawy, czosnek lub szafran.\r\n\r\n## 5. Wypełnij swój talerz kolorem.\r\n\r\nOwoce i warzywa są wypełnione błonnikiem i dostarczają wielu potężnych mikroelementów, w tym związków zwanych polifenolami. „Te bioaktywne związki nie tylko przyczyniają się do smaku, koloru i zapachu pokarmów roślinnych, ale mają również właściwości przeciwutleniające, przeciwzapalne i przeciwnadciśnieniowe” – mówi dr Feresin. Pomagają zapobiegać tworzeniu się płytek przez cholesterol, zapobiegają sklejaniu się komórek krwi, poprawiają rozszerzenie tętnic, zmniejszają sztywność tętnic, obniżają ciśnienie krwi i nie tylko. \r\n\r\nŻaden polifenol nie może być uznany za najlepszy i nie ma jednego konkretnego produktu, który powinieneś zbierać każdego dnia. Kluczem jest różnorodność.\r\n\r\n„Jedną z rzeczy, w które wierzymy, jest to, że te polifenole działają addytywnie i synergistycznie, więc nie jest to tylko jeden; w rzeczywistości to więcej niż jeden wywiera wpływ na organizm” – mówi dr Feresin. „To jeden z powodów, dla których opowiadamy się za zwiększonym spożyciem owoców, warzyw, produktów pełnoziarnistych i roślin strączkowych, ponieważ dostaniesz nie tylko jeden polifenol. Dostaniesz setki polifenoli, a także wszystkie inne składniki odżywcze”.\r\n\r\nStaraj się spożywać co najmniej cztery do sześciu porcji owoców i warzyw dziennie, mówi dr Hong. (Porcje zależą również od takich czynników, jak poziom aktywności — sprawdź MyPlate.gov, aby uzyskać więcej informacji.) Wymieszaj to tak, aby podczas większości posiłków spożywać szerokie spektrum składników odżywczych. „Lubię widzieć na twoim talerzu co najmniej trzy lub cztery różne kolory” – mówi dr Hong.\r\n\r\n## 6. Ogranicz dodawanie cukrów.\r\n\r\nMówiąc o zdrowiu serca, dobrym pomysłem jest wybieranie węglowodanów bogatych w składniki odżywcze, takie jak błonnik, a nie tych, które nie zawierają wielu innych składników w tabeli składników odżywczych. Oznacza to, że dobrym pomysłem może być ograniczenie spożycia dodanych cukrów, które często znajdują się w produktach takich jak napoje gazowane, wypieki, pieczywo i sosy do sałatek. „Dodane cukry” odnoszą się do cukrów lub syropów dodawanych podczas przetwarzania, a nie do cukrów naturalnych w owocach lub nabiału.\r\n\r\nDodane cukry przyczyniają się do nadmiernej ilości kalorii, mówi dr Hong. Kalorie nie są z natury złe — potrzebujesz ich jako energii — ale jeśli chcesz monitorować spożycie kalorii ze względów zdrowotnych, takich jak leczenie cukrzycy, najlepsze może być pobieranie ich z innych źródeł. Nie musisz całkowicie unikać *wszystkich* dodanych cukrów, ale wytyczne dietetyczne dla Amerykanów zalecają ograniczenie spożycia do nie więcej niż 10% dziennego spożycia kalorii.\r\n\r\nPrawie połowa wszystkich dodanych przez nas cukrów pochodzi z napojów, zgodnie z wytycznymi, co sprawia, że ​​to, co pijesz, jest solidnym punktem wyjścia do ponownej oceny. Dr Hong mówi, że kiedy znajdziesz obszar, w którym możesz wprowadzić zmiany – powiedzmy zwykły nawyk napoju gazowanego – zrób to powoli. Załóżmy, że pijesz cztery napoje gazowane tygodniowo. Mógłbyś spróbować zredukować go do dwóch, a później do jednego, mówi.\r\n\r\nMożesz zauważyć korzystne efekty zamiany słodkich napojów lub innych rodzajów żywności w niektórych markerach zdrowia. W badaniu opublikowanym w *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* ludzie, którzy zmniejszyli spożycie rafinowanych ziaren, dodali cukry i napoje słodzone cukrem (oraz zwiększyli spożycie owoców, warzyw, roślin strączkowych, ryb i orzechów) markery ryzyka sercowo-naczyniowego, takie jak ciśnienie krwi i poziom cukru we krwi na czczo, w ciągu sześciu miesięcy.\r\n\r\n## 7. Obserwuj spożycie alkoholu.\r\n\r\n„Wielu ludzi naprawdę nie docenia ilości wypijanego alkoholu” – mówi dr Hong. „Mogą wypić drinka po powrocie do domu, kolejnego drinka lub dwa do kolacji, a potem drinka przed snem”.\r\n\r\nDwa drinki dziennie (dla mężczyzn) i jeden dziennie (dla kobiet) są uważane za rozsądne ilości – amerykańskie wytyczne dietetyczne uznają to za „umiarkowane” spożycie. Co więcej, pijesz dużo nadmiaru cukru. „Przypominam pacjentom: Zgadnij, na co rozkłada się alkohol? Cukier” – mówi dr Hong. Poza tym łatwo jest przekąsić dodatkową przekąskę podczas picia. Podobnie jak wiele innych zachowań, o których wspomnieliśmy, nie jest to automatycznie „zły” nawyk żywieniowy, którego nigdy nie możesz praktykować, jeśli chcesz mieć zdrowe serce. Jednak w zależności od tego, co przekąszasz i jak często jesz podczas picia, częste dodatkowe podjadanie oprócz regularnych nawyków żywieniowych może prowadzić do przyrostu masy ciała, kolejnego czynnika ryzyka chorób sercowo-naczyniowych. (Nauka o wadze i zdrowiu serca jest złożona — oprócz wagi należy wziąć pod uwagę inne czynniki, o których możesz przeczytać więcej tutaj).\r\n\r\nCo więcej, badania sugerują, że nadmierne picie może wpływać na serce w inny sposób niż przybieranie na wadze. Według przeglądu badań opublikowanego w czasopiśmie *Alcohol Research* zbyt dużo alkoholu może przyczyniać się do wzrostu ciśnienia krwi i stanu zapalnego, a także może sprzyjać zlepianiu się płytek krwi, co może prowadzić do powstawania niebezpiecznych skrzepów krwi.\r\n\r\nDieta zdrowa dla serca nie musi oznaczać, że nigdy nie będziesz mieć tego kieliszka wina, tej kupionej w sklepie paczki babeczek ani dodatkowej posypki popcornem. Chodzi bardziej o wprowadzanie małych zmian – i konsekwentne ich przestrzeganie – które mogą mieć duży wpływ na twoje serce.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:21:06', '2021-03-10 19:37:16', '/resources/images/veggies_healthy_eating.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/heart-healthy-diet', 0, 0);

Food Stying by Drew Aichele. Prop Styling by Campbell Pearson.\r\n\r\n*Witamy w **Pamiętniku spożywczym**, nowej serii, która pokazuje, jak zróżnicowane i spersonalizowane jest „zdrowe odżywianie”. Tak wiele czynników wpływa na wybory, jakich dokonujemy w sklepie spożywczym, w tym dostęp i przystępność cenową, warunki zdrowotne, nasze indywidualne pochodzenie kulturowe, a nawet to, co po prostu uszczęśliwia nas (i nasze kubki smakowe). Poprosiliśmy więc ludzi w całym kraju, aby podzielili się z nami swoimi listami zakupów, a następnie zadzwoniliśmy do kilku z nich, aby zapytać o więcej szczegółów. Dlaczego kupują to, co kupują? Ile wydają? Dla kogo kupują? O jakich stanach zdrowotnych lub kwestiach żywieniowych myślą, kiedy wybierają na przykład mleko migdałowe zamiast krowiego, czy konkretne smaki, przyprawy lub smakołyki? W tym odcinku Pamiętniki spożywcze słyszymy od właściciela sklepu spożywczego w Kentucky, który pracuje nad zwiększeniem dostępu do świeżej żywności w dzielnicy West End w Louisville.*\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n**Imię:** Shauntrice Martin\r\n**Wiek:** 36\r\n**Zawód:** Lobbysta i właściciel sklepu spożywczego\r\n**Lokalizacja:** Louisville, Kentucky\r\n**Rasa/Płeć:** Czarna kobieta\r\n**Warunki zdrowotne/ograniczenia dietetyczne do rozważenia:** Shauntrice ma w rodzinie cukrzycę i wysokie ciśnienie krwi.\r\n**Częstotliwość zakupów spożywczych:** zakupy dwa razy w tygodniu dla dwóch osób\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nNiektóre z ulubionych wspomnień Shauntrice Martin z dzieciństwa dotyczą przygotowywania kolacji z dziadkami. „Nauczyłam się wielu historii o naszej rodzinie w tym czasie, kiedy przygotowywaliśmy posiłki” – opowiada SELF. Shauntrice również doceniła świeże jedzenie i domowe posiłki po tym, jak jej prababka zbierała warzywa z jej farmy. „Pamiętam, że mogłam zobaczyć wszystko, co zostało umieszczone w przepisie i zrozumieć znaczenie każdego składnika”, mówi. „Gdybyśmy czegoś nie mieli, cały przepis by się zmienił”.\r\n\r\nW domu Shauntrice jadła zupełnie inaczej. Jej mama pracowała długie godziny i nie miała czasu na gotowanie, więc Shauntrice często jadła posiłki w kuchence mikrofalowej lub inne pakowane produkty. Co więcej, jej mama po prostu nie miała dostępu do świeżej żywności w lokalnym sklepie spożywczym. „Byliśmy na kartkach żywnościowych, ale miejsce, z którego dostaliśmy nasze jedzenie, nie miało naprawdę świeżych opcji”, mówi.\r\nJako dorosła Shauntrice zastanawiała się, czy jedzenie wpłynęło na historię medyczną jej rodziny. Jej babcia miała cukrzycę, a jej mama nadciśnienie, ale według wiedzy Shauntrice, jej prababcia nie miała tego typu schorzeń. „Dużo myślę o tym, jak jadła moja mama, w porównaniu do sposobu, w jaki jadła moja prababcia, i to naprawdę wpływa na to, co teraz jem” – mówi.\r\n\r\nNależy wspomnieć, że mama Shauntrice paliła, co jest jednym z czynników ryzyka rozwoju wysokiego ciśnienia krwi. Według National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) wysokie ciśnienie krwi ma miejsce, gdy twoja krew wywiera nadmierną siłę na ściany tętnic. Według Mayo Clinic, ludzie rozwijają wysokie ciśnienie krwi z różnych powodów, w tym diety wysokosodowej, rodzinnej historii choroby i palenia. Z biegiem czasu wysokie ciśnienie krwi może prowadzić do innych schorzeń, takich jak zawał serca. I chociaż istnieje wiele sposobów zapobiegania lub kontrolowania wysokiego ciśnienia krwi, jednym z nich jest regularne spożywanie różnych pożywnych produktów spożywczych (zwłaszcza owoców i warzyw).\r\n\r\nShauntrice jest również zaniepokojony rozwojem cukrzycy, która ma miejsce, gdy poziom cukru we krwi jest stale zbyt wysoki, wyjaśnia Narodowy Instytut Cukrzycy oraz Chorób Układu Pokarmowego i Nerek (NIDDK). Glukoza jest głównym źródłem energii naszego organizmu i otrzymujemy ją z pożywienia i napojów. Osoby z cukrzycą mogą mieć problemy, takie jak uszkodzenie nerwów, problemy z oczami i choroba nerek. Plany leczenia są różne i mogą obejmować przyjmowanie insuliny lub ograniczanie ilości spożywanych tłuszczów nasyconych, sodu i cukru.\r\n\r\nOkreślając, jak jeść, aby czuć się jak najlepiej i starając się unikać tych warunków, Shauntrice nie bada etykiet żywności, aby śledzić takie rzeczy, jak cukier lub tłuszcze nasycone. Dla niej zdrowe odżywianie oznacza włączenie do swojej diety różnorodnej, świeżej żywności. „Patrzę na kolory w moim koszyku. Czy mam szeroki wybór owoców i warzyw?” ona tłumaczy. Ale może to być trudny cel do osiągnięcia. Shauntrice mieszka w West End w Louisville, gdzie, jak mówi, jest głównie obszar czarny, ma tylko jeden duży sklep spożywczy. Według USA obszar ten jest pustynią żywnościową, co oznacza, że ​​jest to społeczność o niskich dochodach ze zbyt małą liczbą sklepów spożywczych. Wydział Rolnictwa.\r\nPrzed pandemią Shauntrice robił zakupy spożywcze w bogatszej dzielnicy, gdzie sklepy miały większy wybór świeżych produktów. Następnie, w czerwcu, jej jedyny lokalny sklep spożywczy został zamknięty na okres protestów Black Lives Matter. Shauntrice została zainspirowana do otwarcia własnego sklepu spożywczego, Black Market KY, który sprzedaje produkty lokalnych i należących do Blacka firm. „To było dla mnie bardzo ważne”, mówi. „Społeczność jest w większości czarna, ale nie mamy wielu czarnych biznesów. Zależy mi na tym, aby więcej czarnych firm mogło zarabiać pieniądze. Teraz Shauntrice robi zakupy w swoim własnym sklepie dla siebie i swojego siedmioletniego syna Iniejah, a także pozyskuje część żywności od innych lokalnych sklepów i sprzedawców. Oto 10 rzeczy, które zjada w typowym tygodniu.\r\n\r\n**1. Plantany: 7 USD**\r\n\r\nShauntrice dowiedziała się o bananach, kiedy studiowała za granicą w Trynidadzie podczas college\'u. „Myślałam, że to jest jak banan z Trynidadu” — mówi. „Nie wiem nawet, czy słyszałem wcześniej słowo *babka*”. Mówi, że mieszkanie w innym kraju przez semestr otworzyło jej umysł na jedzenie, którego normalnie by nie próbowała. „Byłem bardzo wybredny przed wyjazdem z kraju” – mówi Shauntrice. „Zobowiązałem się, że spróbuję nowych rzeczy. Nie chciałem lekceważyć ludzi i ich jedzenia”. Teraz smażone banany to jedna z jej ulubionych przekąsek. „Bardzo lubię, kiedy są poczerniałe” — mówi.\r\n\r\n**2. Akee z Jamajki: 13 USD**\r\n\r\nPodczas swojego pobytu na Trynidadzie Shauntrice dowiedziała się również o ackee, owocu pochodzącym z Afryki Zachodniej, a także popularnym na Karaibach. Pamięta, jak podczas śniadania siadała ackee z soloną rybą (ludzie często jedzą obie razem). W tym czasie Shauntrice myślała, że ​​duże kawałki jasnożółtych owoców to jajecznica. „Pomyślałem: Może to nie jest jajko kurze. Nie zadawałam żadnych pytań – mówi. (Później dowiedziała się o ackee od swojego profesora). Shauntrice robi ackee w domu, ilekroć jest w magazynie na jej lokalnym afrykańskim rynku. „Nie zawsze chodzę na targ”, mówi nam. „Zazwyczaj dzwonię z wyprzedzeniem i upewniam się, że jest”. Powiedziawszy to, Shauntrice zwykle je sam owoc zamiast ze swoim zwykłym towarzyszem z owoców morza: „Nie jestem dobry w robieniu solonej ryby”.\r\n\r\n**3. Ekologiczne jajka z farm fonograficznych: 3 USD**\r\n\r\nCo trzy tygodnie Shauntrice jeździ przez trzy godziny, aby kupić jajka z farmy należącej do byłego gracza NFL, George\'a Wilsona. „To nasz najlepiej sprzedający się artykuł w sklepie” – mówi. Shauntrice mówi, że jajka fonograficzne smakują zauważalnie inaczej niż standardowe jajka w sklepie spożywczym: „Są pyszne. Są zdrowsze, a żółtko jest grubsze. Są znacznie bardziej puszyste, gdy robisz jajecznicę lub naleśniki.\r\n\r\n**4.****Wells Made Co. Masło Orzechowe z Pieczonego Banana ****: 14 USD**\r\n\r\nTo była miłość od pierwszego smaku, kiedy Shauntrice spróbowała tego bananowego masła orzechowego na imprezie biznesowej, której właścicielami byli kobiety w 2019 roku. „Jest w nim trochę chipsów bananowych. To trochę jak ciasteczka i lody śmietankowe, ale z chipsami bananowymi” – mówi. „Po prostu smakuje naprawdę dobrze i jest super słodki z banana. Nie jadłem masła orzechowego z tym pierwiastkiem.” Zjada to na grzance z rodzynkami cynamonowymi i w swoich koktajlach.\r\n\r\n**5.****Beeing2Gether** **Surowy miód: 6 USD**\r\n\r\nPrzyjaciele Shauntrice często oznaczają ją w postach na Facebooku o firmach z Louisville. W ten sposób Shauntrice dowiedziała się o Keith Griffith III, 13-letnim pszczelarzu i właścicielu miodu Beeing2Gether. Kochała jego ambicję i wspiera Keitha, sprzedając jego miód na Black Market KY. „Kiedy miałam 13 lat, nie myślałam o zakładaniu firmy” – mówi. „Teraz jestem właścicielem firmy i nie wyobrażam sobie, żebym była wystarczająco dojrzała, by to robić nawet 10 lat temu. To dla mnie niesamowite”. Lubi polewać miodem pieczoną rybę, koktajle i naleśniki.\r\n\r\n![Obraz może zawierać homar i żeberka z owoców morza pochodzenia zwierzęcego](/resources/images/medium12102020-R_C-Chelsea-Kyle-1782.jpg)\r\n\r\nChelsea Kyle. Jedzenie w stylu Drew Aichele. Stylizacja rekwizytów autorstwa Campbella Pearsona.\r\n\r\n**6.****Kiełbasa z Rynku Rodzinnego Cleav**: **10$**\r\n\r\nShauntrice nosi w swoim sklepie mięso z należącej do Blacków farmy Cleav’s Family Market, a także kupuje dla siebie mięso mielone. „To, co zwykle robię, to hamburgery i kiełbaski, które mieszam” — mówi Shauntrice. Następnie dodaje posiekany seler, paprykę, cebulę i czosnek, aby zrobić „wodne hamburgery”, nazwane tak, że są bardzo soczyste dzięki dodanym warzywom. „Tak moja prababcia robiła hamburgery” – mówi.\r\n\r\n**7. Trader Joe\'s Organiczne pieczone wodorosty z solą morską: 3,49 USD**\r\n\r\n„Przechodzę przez tak wiele z nich co tydzień – prawdopodobnie jak 20 paczek” – mówi Shauntrice. „Zawsze otwieram jeden w samochodzie w drodze do domu z Trader Joe”. Początkowo kupiła je dla Iniejah, gdy był małym dzieckiem, ale też je pokochała. W rzeczywistości zawsze trzyma kilka w torebce na wypadek, gdyby chciała chrupiących przekąsek podczas załatwiania sprawunków.\r\n\r\n**8. Kanapka z masłem orzechowym i galaretką z winogron Smucker’s Uncrustables: 7,79 USD**\r\n\r\nIniejah może zrobić wszystko, czego nie trzeba gotować, co wyjaśnia, dlaczego tygodniowo zużywa przynajmniej jedno pudełko Uncrustables. „On robi swoje własne rzeczy. Myślę, że po prostu lubi niezależność” – mówi Shauntrice. Poza tym może je odpakować, nie martwiąc się o sprzątanie po sobie. „Mógłby zrobić kanapkę z masłem orzechowym i galaretką, ale potem musi zmywać naczynia i myślę, że wolałby tego nie robić”.\r\n\r\n**9.****Blue Diamond Almond Breeze Almond Milk Vanilla****: 1,99 USD**\r\n\r\n„Kiedy byłam w ciąży, nabiał nie pasował mi do żołądka i po prostu utknąłem w mleku migdałowym” – mówi Shauntrice o swoich preferencjach dotyczących mleka. „Naszym pierwszym wyborem jest słodzona wanilią, ale często z jakiegoś powodu jest ona niedostępna”. Żyjąc na pustyni żywieniowej, nie zawsze może znaleźć żywność, której chce, na przykład produkty ekologiczne i mleko migdałowe. Kiedy znajduje to migdałowe mleko podczas zakupów, Shauntrice kupuje je dodatkowo, więc zawsze ma je pod ręką.\r\n\r\n**10. Sok jabłkowy z Idy\'s Juice: 5 USD**\r\n\r\nShuantrice zwykła kupować sok jabłkowy od kobiety o imieniu Ida, lokalnej mamy z Louisville. „Wysłałbyś jej wiadomość na Facebooku ze swoim zamówieniem, a ona dostarczyła je do twojego domu”. Więc co sprawiło, że sok Idy jest tak wyjątkowy? Shauntrice mówi, że przypominało jej to świeżo wyciskany cydr, który lubi pić jesienią. Ida nie sprzedaje już soków, mówi Shauntrice, więc domowe koktajle Shauntrice zastąpiły jej zwyczaj soku. „Moją ulubioną mieszanką jest prawdopodobnie ta z kolendrą, limonką i jarmużem. Jest bardzo pikantny” – mówi.\r\n\r\n*Wszystkie produkty prezentowane na SELF są niezależnie wybierane przez naszych redaktorów.

INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (56, 11, 'Na które z zasad dotyczących żywienia w ciąży warto zwrócić uwagę.md', 'There’s a lot of info out there—here’s what matters.', '﻿![What Pregnancy Food Rules Should You Actually Follow](/resources/images/preg_woman%252520healthy_eating.jpeg)Caiaimage/Paul Bradbury/Adobe Stock\r\n\r\n„Zdrowe odżywianie” jest skomplikowane, a staje się jeszcze bardziej skomplikowane, gdy dodasz do tego swoje przyszłe dziecko. Ale na jakie zasady dotyczące jedzenia w ciąży warto zwrócić uwagę, a które są po prostu przesadzone?\r\n\r\nChociaż zawsze dobrym pomysłem jest spożywanie ogólnie dobrze zbilansowanej diety, pełnej produktów bogatych w składniki odżywcze, staje się to jeszcze ważniejsze, gdy jesteś w ciąży. Nie musisz nagle podwajać swoich kalorii, aby „jeść za dwoje”, gdy się tego spodziewasz – tak, to jeden z mitów dotyczących jedzenia w ciąży – ale musisz jeść wystarczająco dużo odpowiednich składników odżywczych, aby utrzymać ciało w ruchu płynnie, a dziecko rozwija się prawidłowo.\r\n\r\n„Odżywianie jest zawsze ważne, ale szczególnie w czasie ciąży, ponieważ to, co jesz, będzie głównym źródłem pożywienia dla dziecka” – mówi SELF Jaime Tucker, dietetyk na oddziale położniczym UC Davis Health.\r\n\r\nDlatego czas, w którym myślisz o zajściu w ciążę, może być świetną okazją do przyjrzenia się swoim nawykom żywieniowym, aby zobaczyć, na jakim etapie jesteś i na czym być może będziesz musiała się bardziej skupić.\r\n\r\nTo szansa dla Ciebie na dokonanie zmiany w swoim życiu, którą możesz kontynuować po urodzeniu się dziecka, dr Manijeh Kamyar, położna wysokiego ryzyka, członek redakcyjnego zespołu zadaniowego ds. *Twojej ciąży i porodu*, książka opublikowana przez American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), byłego członka Panelu Przeglądu Edukacji Pacjentów ACOG, mówi SELF.\r\n\r\nZdrowe odżywianie w czasie ciąży wygląda trochę inaczej dla każdej osoby (choć istnieją pewne ogólne zalecenia), a wiele jest nieporozumień na temat tego, co jeść, a czego nie jeść na tym ważnym etapie życia. Przebijanie się przez hałas i skupianie się na zaleceniach ekspertów, które rzeczywiście zasługują na Twoją uwagę, ułatwi opiekę zarówno nad Tobą, jak i Twoim dzieckiem.\r\n\r\nPonieważ prawda jest taka, że ​​zdrowe odżywianie w czasie ciąży nie różni się *tak* od zdrowego odżywiania przed i po ciąży — z wyjątkiem kilku kluczowych rzeczy.\r\n\r\n## Odżywianie w ciąży polega na ogólnym skupieniu się na zdrowej diecie.\r\n\r\nNajbardziej podstawowe zasady zdrowego odżywiania są takie same, gdy jesteś w ciąży i kiedy nie jesteś. „Jeśli przestrzegasz ogólnych wytycznych dotyczących prawidłowego odżywiania poza ciążą, w dużej mierze podążasz za tym, co powinieneś robić również w czasie ciąży” – mówi dr Kamyar. Oznacza to skupienie się na jedzeniu produktów bogatych w składniki odżywcze, takie jak owoce, warzywa, chude mięso, produkty pełnoziarniste, drób i ryby oraz ograniczenie ilości spożywanych pokarmów o niskiej zawartości składników odżywczych i wysokiej zawartości cukrów oraz tłuszczów nasyconych lub trans. mówi. Jeśli już to robisz, masz dobry początek.\r\n\r\nDokładna ilość białka i węglowodanów, którą potrzebujesz codziennie, będzie zależeć od wielu czynników, w tym od stanu zdrowia w czasie ciąży, rozwoju dziecka, ograniczeń żywieniowych i poziomu aktywności. ACOG zauważa jednak, że tłuszcze powinny stanowić około 20 do 35 procent całkowitego spożycia kalorii kobiety w ciąży. Tłuszcz jest ważny dla rozwoju mózgu płodu, a organizm potrzebuje go do prawidłowego wchłaniania i wykorzystywania niektórych witamin.\r\n\r\nAby uzyskać ogólne pojęcie o tym, ile gramów węglowodanów, białka i tłuszczu należy spożywać każdego dnia, ACOG zaleca rozpoczęcie od przewodnika planowania żywności na MyPlate, który może pomóc w ustaleniu dobrze zbilansowanej diety. (Oczywiście ważne jest, aby zdać sobie sprawę, że ten rodzaj śledzenia może być wyzwalany u osób z zaburzeniami odżywiania.) Jeśli możesz współpracować z zarejestrowanym dietetykiem, aby uzyskać bardziej spersonalizowany plan, to też świetnie.\r\n\r\nJeśli chodzi o składniki odżywcze, niektóre witaminy i minerały są ważne w *każdej* diecie, nie tylko podczas ciąży. Chociaż spożywanie pełnowartościowych pokarmów może ułatwić sprawdzenie ważnych składników odżywczych w ciąży (więcej o tym później) bez zbytniego zastanowienia się nad tym, nie każdy ma taki sam dostęp do świeżej żywności. Całkowicie w porządku, jeśli pakowana i „przetworzona” żywność jest częścią twojej diety z jakiegokolwiek powodu, czy to z powodu dostępu, czy z powodu głodu (lub obu). W rzeczywistości przetworzona żywność – co po prostu oznacza, że ​​żywność została połączona z innym składnikiem lub zmieniona z jej naturalnego stanu – może zawierać produkty bogate w składniki odżywcze, takie jak chleb pełnoziarnisty, masło migdałowe i jogurt, jak wcześniej zgłoszono SELF. A kultura ludzi często wpływa na żywność, która stanowi ich zwykłą dietę, mówi SELF Amy Valent, DOC, specjalistka medycyny matczyno-płodowej i adiunkt położnictwa i ginekologii w Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine. Jest to tym bardziej powód, dla którego nasze społeczne zrozumienie tego, co automatycznie jest lub nie jest „zdrowe” (w czasie ciąży i nie tylko), musi się zmienić.\r\n\r\nCo więcej, odżywianie w ciąży to nie wszystko albo nic: nie chodzi o bycie perfekcyjnym każdego dnia, ale o dokonywanie wyborów, które pomagają promować wspaniałe zdrowie *przez większość czasu. „Daj z siebie wszystko, co masz i bez względu na wysiłek, jaki jesteś w stanie włożyć” – mówi dr Valent. Nawet nauczenie się, jak czytać etykiety żywieniowe, aby móc dokonywać świadomych wyborów tam, gdzie to możliwe – powiedzmy, aby sprawdzić, czy żywność zawiera dużo tłuszczów nasyconych, aby można było rozważyć wybór podobnej opcji z mniejszą ilością – jest świetnym pierwszym krokiem, mówi .\r\n\r\n## Oprócz podstaw, istnieją pewne składniki odżywcze, których potrzebujesz więcej, gdy jesteś w ciąży.\r\n\r\nKwas foliowy\r\n\r\nKwas foliowy to wytwarzana przez człowieka wersja kwasu foliowego, witaminy z grupy B. (Kwas foliowy i folian są często używane zamiennie.) Witamina jest ważna dla kobiet w ciąży, ponieważ może pomóc w zapobieganiu wadom cewy nerwowej, części zarodka, która ostatecznie staje się mózgiem i rdzeniem kręgowym dziecka.\r\n\r\nPonieważ wady te powstają we wczesnych stadiach ciąży, wytyczne sugerują suplementację kwasem foliowym jeszcze przed rozpoczęciem próby zajścia w ciążę. Jeśli myślisz o zajściu w ciążę (lub uprawiasz seks z kimś, kto może zajść w ciążę i nie stosuje ochrony), powinieneś to robić – mówi dr Kamyar.\r\n\r\nWytyczne ACOG zalecają kobietom w ciąży przyjmowanie 600 mikrogramów kwasu foliowego lub kwasu foliowego dziennie. Ponieważ trudno jest uzyskać tak dużo z pożywienia, zalecają suplementację witaminą prenatalną zawierającą co najmniej 400 mikrogramów kwasu foliowego, zaczynając co najmniej miesiąc przed próbą zajścia w ciążę, a następnie kontynuuj przez pierwsze 12 tygodni ciąży. Pozostałe 200 mikrogramów można znaleźć w wzbogacanych płatkach zbożowych, pieczywie i makaronach, ciemnozielonych warzywach liściastych, soku pomarańczowym, fasoli i orzeszkach ziemnych.\r\n\r\nCholina\r\n\r\nCholina jest składnikiem odżywczym, który odgrywa rolę w rozwoju mózgu płodu. Według ACOG, spożywanie jej wystarczającej ilości podczas ciąży może pomóc w zapobieganiu niektórym powszechnym wadom wrodzonym. Amerykański Departament Zdrowia i Opieki Społecznej zaleca kobietom w ciąży przyjmowanie 450 miligramów dziennie. W rzeczywistości nie występuje zbyt często w prenatalnych witaminach, dlatego ważne jest, aby upewnić się, że otrzymujesz je z pokarmów, które spożywasz. Kurczak, wołowina, wątroba zwierzęca, jajka (zwłaszcza żółtko), mleko, soja i orzeszki ziemne są dobrymi źródłami choliny. Ziemniaki, warzywa kapustne, brukselka, brokuły, kalafior oraz niektóre fasole, orzechy, nasiona i produkty pełnoziarniste również zawierają trochę choliny.\r\n\r\nŻelazo\r\n\r\nŻelazo to minerał, którego organizm używa do transportu tlenu we krwi. W czasie ciąży Twoje ciało wykorzystuje ją do wytwarzania dodatkowej krwi, której Ty i Twoje dziecko potrzebujecie. Jeśli nie przyjmiesz wystarczającej ilości tego minerału, możesz rozwinąć anemię z niedoboru żelaza, która może sprawić, że poczujesz się naprawdę słaby lub zmęczony. Zalecenia sugerują, że kobiety w ciąży otrzymują 27 miligramów dziennie (w porównaniu z 18 miligramami zalecanymi dla kobiet niebędących w ciąży).\r\n\r\nMożesz być w stanie uzyskać wystarczającą ilość żelaza w swojej diecie, chociaż dr Valent zauważa, że ​​pokarmy bogate w żelazo – takie jak czerwone mięso, drób i ryby – mogą być trudne do spożycia w wystarczająco dużych ilościach. (Te źródła zwierzęce są znane jako żelazo hemowe.) Roślinne źródła żelaza (znane jako żelazo niehemowe), takie jak soja, szpinak i soczewica, zawierają rodzaj żelaza, który jest nieco trudniejszy do wchłonięcia przez nasz organizm niż hem źródła żelaza. Łączenie tych pokarmów z pokarmami bogatymi w witaminę C (jak owoce cytrusowe) może pomóc organizmowi lepiej przyswajać żelazo. Ponadto większość witamin prenatalnych zawiera trochę żelaza, które uzupełnia luki w diecie. Jeśli skończysz z niedokrwistością z niedoboru żelaza w czasie ciąży, Twój lekarz może zasugerować przyjmowanie suplementu żelaza, który ma więcej tego minerału niż w okresie prenatalnym – i warto zauważyć, że suplementy żelaza mogą powodować wiele nieprzyjemnych objawów żołądkowo-jelitowych u niektórych osób. Chociaż nie zawsze można uniknąć niedokrwistości z niedoboru żelaza, staranie się ograniczyć spożycie żelaza w czasie ciąży jest świetnym rozwiązaniem.\r\n\r\nJod\r\n\r\nJod to minerał, którego organizm używa do wytwarzania hormonów tarczycy, które są ważne dla rozwoju kości i mózgu płodu. Osoby w ciąży powinny otrzymywać 220 mikrogramów dziennie (od 150 mikrogramów dla osób dorosłych niebędących w ciąży).\r\n\r\nWiększość ludzi w USA spożywa dużo jodu, ponieważ jest on dodawany do soli kuchennej. Ale dr Valent mówi, że ponieważ coraz więcej osób gotuje z użyciem soli morskiej i koszernej, które generalnie nie są wzbogacane jodem, może nie być łatwo dla wszystkich w czasie ciąży. American Thyroid Association zaleca, aby wszystkie kobiety w ciąży i karmiące piersią codziennie przyjmowały prenatalną witaminę zawierającą 150 mikrogramów jodu, aby zrekompensować jakąkolwiek lukę w diecie — źródła pokarmowe obejmują nabiał, jaja, ryby morskie, skorupiaki, wodorosty i soję mleko.\r\n\r\nwapń, witamina D i witamina C\r\n\r\nWitamina C, wapń i witamina D odgrywają rolę w budowaniu kości Twojego dziecka. (W rzeczywistości, jeśli nie otrzymujesz wystarczającej ilości wapnia w czasie ciąży, Twoje dziecko może pobierać to, czego potrzebuje, z *Twoich* kości.) Ponadto witamina D przyczynia się do rozwoju skóry i oczu, a witamina C pomaga prawidłowo funkcjonować układowi odpornościowemu.\r\n\r\nWszystkie te trzy składniki odżywcze są ważne podczas ciąży. Zalecana dzienna ilość witaminy C podczas ciąży jest nieznacznie podwyższona w porównaniu z okresem niebędącym w ciąży, z 65 do 80 miligramów dla osób w wieku 18 lat i młodszych oraz z 75 do 85 miligramów dla osób w wieku 19 lat i starszych. Owoce cytrusowe, brokuły, pomidory i truskawki są dobrym źródłem witaminy C.\r\n\r\nNie ma zaleceń dotyczących zwiększania spożycia wapnia lub witaminy D podczas ciąży; po prostu bardzo ważne jest, aby upewnić się, że otrzymujesz zwykle zalecane dzienne ilości. W przypadku wapnia to 1300 miligramów dla osób w wieku 18 lat i młodszych i 1000 miligramów dla osób w wieku 19 lat i starszych. W przypadku witaminy D jest to 600 jednostek międzynarodowych (IU) lub 15 mikrogramów. Mleko wzbogacone i tłuste ryby, takie jak łosoś i sardynki, są najlepszym źródłem witaminy D. (światło słoneczne jest również źródłem witaminy D, ale należy nosić krem ​​z filtrem przeciwsłonecznym, gdy przebywasz na świeżym powietrzu dłużej niż kilka minut, więc zaopatrz się w odpowiednią ilość witamina D z pożywienia będzie łatwiejsza.) Możesz uzyskać wapń z produktów mlecznych, takich jak mleko, jogurt lub ser, lub z innych produktów spożywczych, takich jak sardynki, jarmuż i brokuły.\r\n\r\n## Istnieją ogólne wytyczne dotyczące dodatkowych kalorii i przybierania na wadze, ale nie jest to nauka ścisła.\r\n\r\nTucker mówi, że chociaż tak, w pewnym sensie jesz dla dwojga – to, co jesz, dostarcza również rosnącemu dziecku potrzebnych składników odżywczych – nie musisz podwajać ilości jedzenia, które spożywasz, gdy jesteś w ciąży. W rzeczywistości twoje zapotrzebowanie na kalorie nie wzrasta tak drastycznie w czasie ciąży, mówi.\r\n\r\n„W pierwszym trymestrze tak naprawdę nie masz dodatkowego zapotrzebowania na kalorie, a potem potrzebujesz tylko około 340 więcej dziennie w drugim trymestrze i 450 w trzecim trymestrze”, mówi Tucker. (Te wytyczne ACOG są wyższe, jeśli jesteś w ciąży z wieloma dziećmi – około 300 kalorii więcej na dodatkowy płód). Możesz zaspokoić te potrzeby, dodając jedną lub dwie dodatkowe przekąski w ciągu dnia. Oczywiście, potrzeby kaloryczne każdego z nas różnią się w zależności od wielkości ciała i poziomu aktywności, dlatego ważne jest, aby myśleć o tym jako o 340 lub 450 kcal *więcej* niż norma niebędąca ciążą, zamiast szukać konkretnych liczb, które wszystkie kobiety w ciąży powinny dążyć do.\r\n\r\nPoruszanie się w sytuacji kalorii podczas ciąży może być, delikatnie mówiąc, naprawdę trudne. „Wiemy, że przybieranie na wadze ponad zalecenie] naraża kogoś na ryzyko [na stany takie jak nadciśnienie i [cukrzyca ciążowa]. Z drugiej strony, próba *unikania* przybierania na wadze za pomocą zachowań, takich jak gwałtowne diety, może również zwiększyć ryzyko powikłań ciąży” – mówi dr Valent.\r\nTo, co stanowi zdrowy przyrost masy ciała w czasie ciąży, w dużej mierze zależy od masy ciała. Na przykład, według Centrum Kontroli i Zapobiegania Chorobom (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC) osoba, której wskaźnik masy ciała (BMI) 18,5-24,9 zajdzie w ciążę, powinna przybrać na wadze około 25-35 funtów, jeśli jest w ciąży z jednym dzieckiem. Liczby są niższe dla kogoś z wyższym BMI niż ten i wyższe dla kogoś z niższym BMI niż ten. Rzecz w tym, że BMI daleki jest od idealnej miary zdrowia (więcej o tym tutaj), a ostatecznie wytyczna jest tylko wytyczną.\r\n\r\nCo więcej, sytuacja z nadwagą staje się jeszcze bardziej skomplikowana, ponieważ niektórzy ludzie mogą faktycznie *tracić* wagę w pierwszym trymestrze z powodu niechęci do jedzenia, nudności lub wymiotów. Ponadto przyrost masy ciała nie jest dokładnie stały w czasie ciąży, a niektóre z tego, co zyskujesz, to zwiększona objętość płynów i krwi.\r\n\r\nRadzenie sobie z niejasnymi wytycznymi dotyczącymi ciąży, dotyczącymi i tak już napiętego tematu wagi, jest niezwykle stresujące. Skupienie się na rozwijaniu zdrowego stylu życia i ogólnie zdrowej ciąży ma kluczowe znaczenie dla martwienia się o konkretną liczbę kalorii (a jeśli masz awersję do „zdrowej” żywności, zaopatrzenie się w paliwo jest ważniejsze niż ścisłe przestrzeganie tego, co jesz). To szersze podejście może być również szczególnie pomocne, jeśli masz problemy ze śledzeniem wagi i kalorii.\r\n\r\nBiorąc to pod uwagę, zawsze powinnaś współpracować z lekarzem, gdy tylko jest to możliwe, aby upewnić się, że to, co robisz w związku z jedzeniem podczas ciąży, pomaga, a nie krzywdzi. (Chociaż niektórzy pracownicy służby zdrowia mogą być nieprzydatni i stresujący, jeśli chodzi o wszystko związane z wagą, co tylko komplikuje sprawę.) Dopóki Twoje dziecko prawidłowo rośnie na ultradźwiękach i nie wykluczasz całych grup żywności lub stale ma niedobór jakikolwiek pojedynczy składnik odżywczy, to prawdopodobnie masz się dobrze, mówi Tucker.\r\n\r\n## To prawda, że ​​*są* niektóre pokarmy, których powinieneś unikać podczas ciąży.\r\n\r\nPoniższe produkty spożywcze tworzą tę krótką listę, ponieważ wiążą się z podwyższonym ryzykiem chorób przenoszonych przez żywność lub innymi potencjalnymi zagrożeniami dla zdrowego rozwoju dziecka. Dr Kamyar mówi, że choroby przenoszone przez żywność, takie jak listerioza, salmonella i E.coli, mogą spowodować, że osoba będzie bardzo chora i odwodniona, co może prowadzić do słabych wyników ciąży, takich jak przedwczesny poród i skurcze, a nawet spowodować omdlenia i upadki. W szczególności listerioza jest powiązana z poważniejszymi komplikacjami, w tym poronieniem i urodzeniem martwego dziecka.\r\n\r\nSurowe i wędzone owoce morza, surowe mięso, surowe jajka, wędliny, hot dogi i niepasteryzowane produkty mleczne\r\n\r\nPowodem, dla którego eksperci zalecają unikanie tych pokarmów, jest to, że wszystkie wiążą się z wyższym niż zwykle ryzykiem zanieczyszczenia. „Sushi zrobione z surowej ryby może zawierać pasożyty, które mogą wywołać chorobę; niepasteryzowane produkty mleczne (takie jak niektóre miękkie sery, chociaż można jeść wersje pasteryzowane) mogą przenosić listerię i inne choroby” – mówi dr Kamyar. To samo z surowym mięsem, wędzonymi owocami morza, wędlinami i tak, nawet hot dogami. „Problem z hot-dogami i wędlinami polega na tym, że jeśli nie są przechowywane w lodówce i nie są traktowane w sposób higieniczny, istnieje ryzyko zakażenia bakteriami” – mówi dr Kamyar. Należy również zauważyć, że niektóre konwencjonalnie „zdrowe” pokarmy, takie jak kiełki, seler i kantalupa, również spowodowały epidemie listerii, mówi CDC.\r\n\r\nBiorąc to pod uwagę, możesz oczywiście dostać zatrucia pokarmowego z innych pokarmów. Po prostu w tych przypadkach zdarza się to częściej, więc unikanie ich jest realistycznym sposobem na zminimalizowanie ryzyka, mówi dr Kamyar.\r\n\r\nRyby o wysokiej zawartości rtęci\r\n\r\nRyby to naprawdę bardzo zdrowa żywność podczas ciąży. ACOG zaleca spożywanie co najmniej dwóch porcji ryb lub skorupiaków tygodniowo, aby uzyskać dobrą dawkę kwasów tłuszczowych omega-3, które są ważne dla rozwoju mózgu dziecka. Ryby są również doskonałym źródłem białka – dodaje dr Kamyar.\r\n\r\nAle chcesz uniknąć ryb, które zwykle zawierają dużo rtęci, co wiąże się z wadami wrodzonymi. Należą do nich marlin, rekin, miecznik, dachówka, gardłosz atlantycki, opastun tuńczyk i makrela królewska. Zamiast tego trzymaj się mniejszych ryb, takich jak tilapia, sum i łosoś. Tuńczyk biały (albacore) w puszkach jest również w porządku z umiarem — ACOG sugeruje ograniczenie spożycia do 6 uncji tygodniowo, aby uważać na rtęć.\r\n\r\nInne suplementy oprócz prenatalnych\r\n\r\nEksperci zalecają przyjmowanie witamin prenatalnych przed ciążą iw jej trakcie, abyś mogła upewnić się, że otrzymujesz wszystkie ważne składniki odżywcze, których Ty i Twoje dziecko potrzebujecie. Ale nie powinieneś rozumieć, że powinieneś ładować *wszystkie* suplementy.\r\n\r\nNa przykład, obecnie bardzo popularne CBD nie zostało dobrze zbadane w ciąży — „tak naprawdę nie wiemy, jak wpływa na ciążę”, mówi dr Kamyar — więc to jeden z suplementów, który należy pominąć. Podobnie jak inne suplementy, jest również nieuregulowany, więc nie ma sposobu, aby dowiedzieć się, co tak naprawdę w nim jest.\r\n\r\nNawet regularne multiwitaminy mogą nie być dobrym pomysłem na twoje prenatalne. Dr Kamyar mówi, że niektóre multiwitaminy mogą mieć wysoki poziom witaminy A. Nadmiar witaminy A podczas ciąży jest związany z wadami wrodzonymi ośrodkowego układu nerwowego i układu sercowo-naczyniowego oraz spontaniczną aborcją. Oczywiście potrzebujesz *trochę* witaminy A – jest to szczególnie ważne dla zdrowego rozwoju oczu. Dr Kamyar mówi, że dopóki nie stosujesz jej suplementacji i po prostu otrzymujesz witaminę A z pokarmów takich jak słodkie ziemniaki i marchew oraz twoja prenatalna, nie powinieneś martwić się przyjmowaniem zbyt dużych ilości.\r\n\r\nKonkluzja: Zawsze porozmawiaj z lekarzem przed przyjęciem jakiegokolwiek suplementu, bez względu na to, jak naturalnie i nieszkodliwie to brzmi, w czasie ciąży.\r\n\r\n## Eksperci sugerują również ograniczenie kofeiny i całkowite unikanie alkoholu.\r\n\r\nByć może nie będziesz musiał *przestać* swojego codziennego nawyku picia kawy, ale w zależności od tego, ile pijesz, być może będziesz musiał go ograniczyć: eksperci zalecają ograniczenie spożycia kofeiny w czasie ciąży do 200 miligramów lub mniej dziennie. To mniej więcej ilość w jednej filiżance kawy o pojemności 12 uncji (zawartość kofeiny różni się w zależności od metody palenia i parzenia).\r\n\r\nPowód? Eksperci wiedzą, że kofeina przenika przez łożysko, co oznacza, że ​​może zostać przekazana dziecku, jeśli spożyje ją ciężarna osoba. Ale badania na temat tego, ile kofeiny jest OK, zanim może zakłócić rozwój płodu, są niejednoznaczne. Istnieją również pewne obawy dotyczące potencjalnego związku między kofeiną a zwiększoną częstością występowania poronień samoistnych, ale dotychczasowe badania są ponownie niejednoznaczne. Dopóki nie dowiemy się więcej, najlepiej będzie trzymać się maksymalnie 200 miligramów, aby być bezpiecznym.\r\n\r\nCo do alkoholu? Chociaż mogłeś słyszeć od przyjaciela lub z książki, że lekkie picie w czasie ciąży może być w porządku, zarówno ACOG, jak i CDC stanowczo twierdzą, że picie dowolnego rodzaju alkoholu w dowolnym momencie ciąży może potencjalnie wpłynąć na rozwój dziecka i spowodować wady wrodzone i problemy z zachowaniem przez całe życie. To zalecenie nie jest jednak pozbawione kontrowersji. Niektóre badania, w tym duńskie badanie z 2012 r. obejmujące 1628 kobiet i ich dzieci w wieku 5 lat, doprowadziły do ​​mylących wniosków, sugerując, że niskie do umiarkowanego spożycie alkoholu (mniej niż osiem drinków tygodniowo) we wczesnej ciąży może ostatecznie nie wpływać na funkcjonowanie mózgu dziecka . Z drugiej strony przegląd systematyczny i metaanaliza *Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research* z 2013 r. wykazały, że na podstawie trzech badań z udziałem około 11 900 dzieci w wieku od 9 miesięcy do 5 lat picie umiarkowane w czasie ciąży (do sześciu drinków tygodniowo) wiązał się z problemami behawioralnymi. I chociaż wcześniejsze wytyczne w Wielkiej Brytanii ograniczały spożywanie alkoholu w czasie ciąży do jednej do dwóch jednostek alkoholu raz lub dwa razy w tygodniu – dwie jednostki odpowiadają średniej wielkości kieliszka wina – w 2016 r. zmieniono je, aby pokazać, że żaden poziom alkoholu nie jest bezpieczny dla drink.\r\n\r\nPodobnie jak w przypadku kofeiny, po prostu nie mamy rzetelnych badań potwierdzających, że dokładna ilość picia alkoholu jest bezpieczna w dowolnym momencie ciąży (nie jest ani łatwe ani moralnie rozsądne przeprowadzanie badań, w których kobieta w ciąży pije alkohol i czeka, aby zobaczyć, jak wpływa na zdrowie ich dziecka). Dr Valent mówi, że dopóki nie będziemy mieli bardziej solidnych badań i konkretnych dowodów na to, ile dokładnie może być bezpieczne, bezpieczniej jest po prostu nie robić tego w ogóle. Jednocześnie niektórzy ludzie uważają, że wytyczne „nie pij, jeśli masz niewielkie szanse na zajście w ciążę” są paternalistyczne i przesadne. W związku z tym, jeśli zdarzyło Ci się wypić niewielką ilość alkoholu, zanim dowiedziałaś się, że jesteś w ciąży, poważna szkoda dla Twojego dziecka jest mało prawdopodobna, według ACOG – najlepszym rozwiązaniem byłoby nie pić więcej po tym, jak dowiedziałeś się o swojej ciąży. ciąża.\r\n\r\nPodczas gdy konieczność pominięcia tych filiżanek kawy – lub odrzucenia jajka w koszulce na śniadanie lub zwykłego kieliszka wina do obiadu – może być denerwująca, pomocne może być przeformułowanie diety w czasie ciąży: Zamiast patrzeć na ciążę jak na czas, kiedy nie możesz mieć pewnych rzeczy, potraktuj to jako okazję do sprawdzenia, jak odżywiasz swoje ciało. Nadszedł czas, aby dać swojemu ciału to, czego potrzebuje, aby być zdrowym i wyhodować kolejnego człowieka – to całkiem niesamowite, prawda? Dodatkową korzyścią jest to, że nauczysz się wspaniałych rzeczy o jedzeniu produktów bogatych w składniki odżywcze i dbaniu o siebie, których możesz używać również poza ciążą. A w te dni, kiedy nawet ta zmiana uwagi nie usuwa żądła rezygnacji z niektórych pokarmów i napojów podczas ciąży, dobrą wiadomością jest to, że nie będzie to trwało wiecznie.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:22:44', '2021-03-10 19:38:32', '/resources/images/preg_woman%2520healthy_eating.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/pregnancy-food-rules-to-follow', 0, 0);

Wielu z nas ma mgliste pojęcie o tym, czym jest, a czym nie jest zdrowe odżywianie, ale kiedy to wszystko przeanalizujesz, rzeczywista logistyka dotycząca zdrowego odżywiania nie zawsze jest łatwa do wyjaśnienia lub intuicyjna. W rzeczywistości czasami jest to naprawdę zagmatwane.\r\n\r\nPo pierwsze, istnieje wiele opinii i informacji (i dezinformacji), więc trudno jest wiedzieć, czego słuchać. Doprowadziło to do naprawdę wąskiego spojrzenia na zdrowe odżywianie, które jest przesiąknięte kulturą żywieniową, co wypaczyło wiele naszego myślenia o tym, jak powinny brzmieć porady dotyczące zdrowego odżywiania. Ten przekaz oparty na kulturze żywieniowej często narzuca ograniczenia i nakazowe zasady, które nie biorą pod uwagę czynników osobistych, kulturowych i społeczno-ekonomicznych, które wpływają na wygląd zdrowej diety dla każdej osoby. Wiąże się z tym założenie, w dużej mierze napędzane przez fatfobię, że zdrowe odżywianie jest równoznaczne z jedzeniem w celu schudnięcia.\r\n\r\nInnymi słowy: to naturalne, że jesteś od małego do bardzo zagubionego w tym, jak naprawdę zdrowo się odżywiać. Tak więc, aby uzyskać wskazówki, jak rozszerzyć tę definicję zdrowego odżywiania, poprosiliśmy 11 zarejestrowanych dietetyków z różnych środowisk, osobiście i zawodowo, o najlepsze wskazówki dotyczące zdrowego odżywiania, które są elastyczne i wzmacniające, a nie sztywne i karzące. Dzielili się praktycznymi radami, które mogą ułatwić ludziom wzbogacanie i urozmaicenie odżywiania w ich diecie oraz przygotowywanie własnych pysznych, satysfakcjonujących posiłków – a także, co równie ważne, pielęgnowanie spokojniejszej i przyjemniejszej relacji z jedzeniem i jedzeniem . Skorzystaj z przemawiających do Ciebie wskazówek i dodaj je do swojego jedynego w swoim rodzaju zestawu narzędzi do zdrowego odżywiania.\r\n\r\n## 1. Odrzuć diety uniwersalne.\r\n\r\n„Kultura diety jest z natury homogeniczna dzięki szerokim, szerokim zaleceniom zdrowotnym i ogólnym receptom na odchudzanie. Nie tylko jesteśmy niesamowicie zróżnicowani na poziomie żywieniowym, ale także wykładniczo bardziej złożoności na poziomie zdrowia. Więc jeśli ktoś mówi ci, że odkrył odpowiednią dietę dla większości ciał, możesz to potraktować jako sygnał, że nie jest to oparte na nauce i prawdopodobnie oddali cię od siebie”. —*Lindsay Birchfield MS, R.D., L.D., aktywistka zdrowia i ciała oraz dietetyk w* *Tworzenie pokoju za pomocą jedzenia* *i* *Zakorzeniona opieka zdrowotna nad sercem*\r\n\r\n## 2. Upewnij się, że faktycznie jesz wystarczająco dużo w ciągu dnia.\r\n\r\n„Najważniejszym aspektem zdrowego odżywiania jest to, czy jesz wystarczająco dużo. Brzmi prosto, ale tak wielu ludzi spędza długie okresy czasu bez jedzenia w ciągu dnia, albo dlatego, że jest to najnowsza moda dietetyczna, albo dlatego, że są pochłonięci co robią. Poczujesz się znacznie bardziej czujny i pełen energii, jeśli będziesz jadł coś co trzy do czterech godzin w ciągu dnia”. —*Rachael Hartley, RD, certyfikowany doradca ds. intuicyjnego żywienia i właściciel* *Rachael Hartley Nutrition*\r\n\r\n## 3. Skoncentruj się na włączaniu większej ilości produktów spożywczych, a nie na usuwaniu jedzenia.\r\n\r\n\r\n„Pomyśl o pokarmach do dodania, a nie do usunięcia. Bardzo popularne i modne jest konsekwentne usuwanie pokarmów lub grup produktów spożywczych (takich jak węglowodany lub owoce), ale to tylko sprawi, że większość ludzi poczuje się tak, jakby mieli „obsesję” na punkcie jedzenia. Nadal możesz jeść to, co lubisz, ale może pomyśl o dodaniu warzyw na przykład do pizzy lub z boku, aby zachować równowagę. Miałem klienta, który uwielbiał makaron błyskawiczny ramen. Powiedziałem jej, żeby zatrzymała makaron, ale dodaj trochę białka, aby zachować moc (takie jak grillowany kurczak, tofu lub fasola) i wrzuć trochę posiekanego szpinaku i papryki na warzywa. Dodawanie, a nie odbieranie”. —*Shana Minei Spence, MS, RDN, CDN, założycielka* *The Nutrition Tea*\r\n\r\n## 4. Stwórz listę swoich wartości, a następnie zastanów się, w jakim stopniu Twój stosunek do jedzenia jest z nimi zgodny.\r\n\r\n„O tym rozmawiam z każdym klientem, ponieważ jest to bardzo wnikliwe w zrozumieniu naszych motywacji i zachowań. Przykładami ważnych wartości mogą być między innymi otwartość, uczciwość, szacunek lub życzliwość. Spróbuj połączyć swoje działania związane z jedzeniem lub jedzeniem ze swoimi wartościami, aby zobaczyć, czy je podtrzymują, czy nie.\r\n\r\nNa przykład, jeśli cenisz szczerość, ale nie mówisz ze sobą szczerze o swoich preferencjach żywieniowych, pojawia się napięcie, które może zaszkodzić twojemu związkowi z jedzeniem lub twojemu długoterminowemu samopoczuciu. Dodatkowo, jeśli cenisz szacunek, ale nie szanujesz potrzeb energetycznych swojego organizmu lub apetytu na określone pokarmy, możesz zauważyć pewne możliwości wprowadzenia zmian. Jeśli spróbujesz tego, pamiętaj, aby pozostać uziemionym w miejscu, w którym nie możesz osądzać; to ćwiczenie ma na celu pielęgnowanie ciekawości tylko bez powodowania dalszego poczucia winy lub wstydu za to, co możesz odkryć w trakcie.” —*Cara Harbstreet, MS RD L.D. z* *Inteligentne odżywianie ulicy*\r\n\r\n## 5. Celowo uwzględniaj powiązania społeczne i kulturowe w swoich doświadczeniach kulinarnych.\r\n\r\n„Jeśli Twój pomysł na zdrowe odżywianie koncentruje się tylko na zawartości składników odżywczych w żywności i myślisz o jedzeniu przez cały dzień, nawet jeśli uważasz, że zjadłeś wystarczająco dużo, może brakować Ci jednego lub wszystkich z tych kluczowych składników: przyjemności, satysfakcja i więzi społeczne] Rozszerz swoją definicję zdrowego odżywiania, włączając te kluczowe składniki do swoich wyborów żywieniowych, kiedy tylko jest to możliwe.\r\n\r\nZEGAREK\r\n\r\nPrzyjazna dla początkujących medytacja prowadzona z Jessamyn Stanley\r\n\r\nSpróbuj zaplanować posiłek Zoom z przyjaciółmi lub rodziną, wspominając dobre czasy. Odtwórz ulubione posiłki z dzieciństwa, aby przywrócić miłe wspomnienia i przyjemne doznania kulinarne. Lub dla urozmaicenia i pocieszenia nostalgii, włączaj do swoich posiłków przepisy i składniki ze swojej kultury”. —*Ayana Habtemariam**, MSW, RDN, LDN, terapeuta żywieniowy i certyfikowany doradca ds. odżywiania intuicyjnego*\r\n\r\n## 6. Opisz swoje jedzenie w inny sposób niż „zdrowe” i „niezdrowe”.\r\n\r\n„Bądź kreatywny w sposobie, w jaki opisujesz lub myślisz o swoim jedzeniu. Zazwyczaj jesteśmy przyzwyczajeni do myślenia o jedzeniu w zorganizowanych kategoriach, takich jak zdrowe lub niezdrowe, dobre lub złe. Ale te etykiety mogą promować albo wzorzec „wszystko albo nic” (gdzie uważasz, że nie powinieneś spożywać niektórych produktów, jeśli nie są one uważane za zdrowe lub dobre) lub cykl poczucia winy i wstydu, jeśli lubisz produkty, które uważasz za mniej odżywcze.\r\n\r\nZamiast tego zachęcam Cię do jak największej kreatywności w opisie swojego jedzenia. Zrób listę tak wielu opisowych słów (pikantne, pikantne, chrupiące, rozpływające się w wodzie itp.), jak tylko możesz. To może skierować cię w stronę twoich prawdziwych preferencji żywieniowych w porównaniu z zasadami żywieniowymi, które przyswoiłeś sobie z kultury dietetycznej”. —*Cara Harbstreet, MS R.D.L.D.*\r\n\r\n## 7. Przyspiesz gotowanie.\r\n\r\n„Maksymalizacja czasu spędzanego w kuchni jest tak ważna, zwłaszcza że wszyscy płyniemy po niezbadanych wodach. Korzystanie z podstawowych produktów, takich jak trzykrotnie prane i pakowane warzywa lub wstępnie posiekane warzywa, skraca czas przygotowania o połowę. A marki takie jak Brooklyn Delhi czy Saffron Road oferują niezwykle aromatyczne sosy na wolnym ogniu, które ożywiają każdą potrawę w mniej niż pięć minut. Bliski przyjaciel właśnie przyniósł mi trochę sosów aczar z Brooklyn Dehli i jestem nowym nawróconym – a lista składników jest niesamowita”. —*Maya Feller, MS, R.D., CDN z Brooklynu* *Maya Feller Nutrition**,* Good Morning America *ekspert żywieniowy i autor* książki The Southern Comfort Food Diabetes Cookbook: Over 100 Recipes for a Healthy Life\r\n\r\n## 8. Spróbuj uważnego jedzenia, nawet na jeden kęs.\r\n\r\n„Praktykowanie świadomego jedzenia może pomóc nam odzyskać trochę radości z jedzenia i odkryć nasze rzeczywiste preferencje żywieniowe. Uważne jedzenie to zwracanie uwagi na zmysły – wzrok, zapach, dotyk i smak jedzenia. Uważne jedzenie oznacza, że ​​poświęcamy czas, aby naprawdę doświadczyć tego, co jemy.\r\n\r\nZawsze polecam ludziom zacząć od małego, od jednego uważnego kęsa! Więc… na początek weź kilka głębokich oddechów, przygotowując się, aby naprawdę posmakować swojego jedzenia. Poświęć chwilę na zwrócenie uwagi na kolor, zapach, konsystencję i po prostu zjedz jeden kęs. Nie spiesz się, pozwalając mu usiąść na języku, powoli żuć, pozwalając kubkom smakowym wchłonąć to wszystko. To wszystko, co musisz zrobić. Możesz zauważyć, że jedzenie smakuje inaczej, kiedy faktycznie pozwolisz sobie na jego posmakowanie”. —*Erica Leon*, MS, RDN, CDN, terapeuta żywieniowy i dyplomowany dietetyk zajmujący się zaburzeniami odżywiania*\r\n\r\n## 9. Dodaj więcej błonnika do swojej diety.\r\n\r\n„Błonnik jest integralną częścią zdrowia jelit. Błonnik jest nie tylko odpowiedzialny za utrzymywanie regularności, ale jest również integralną częścią pomagania organizmowi w kolonizacji dobrych bakterii jelitowych. Dodawanie produktów bogatych w błonnik do codziennej rutyny może być dość proste. Spróbuj pradawnego zboża, takiego jak kasza bulgur (która ma prawie 30% wartości dziennej spożycia dla błonnika) lub jęczmień”. —*Maya Feller, MS, R.D., CDN*\r\n\r\n## 10. Nie przejmuj się tak bardzo „zjedzeniem tęczy”.\r\n\r\n„Często czujemy, że musimy sprawić, by nasze talerze były super kolorowe, dodając warzywa, ale tak wiele warzyw niekoniecznie jest kolorowych. Myślę, że czas to przemyśleć. Nawet jeśli twój talerz jest bardzo monotonny, nie martw się — dodaj warzywko, które pasuje do dania i będzie je uzupełniać. Na przykład dorastałem, jedząc dominikańskie posiłki, gdzie mamy dużo warzyw korzeniowych, takich jak yuca, yautia i malanga. Wcale nie kolorowe, ale pełne wartości odżywczych. Jeśli możesz, spróbuj nowych i innych warzyw, niezależnie od koloru”. —*Dalina Soto M.A., R.D., L.D.N., dwujęzyczna dietetyczka i założycielka* *Nutritiously Yours* *oraz* *Your Latina Nutrition*\r\n\r\n## 11. Wybierz bardziej zwykłe warzywa zamiast modnych „superfoods”.\r\n\r\n„Jeśli robisz tylko jedną rzecz, dodaj więcej warzyw. Tylko zwykłe warzywa. Większość Amerykanów nie spełnia zalecanego dziennego spożycia warzyw. I chociaż odkrywanie proszków superfood i specjalnych napojów dla lepszego zdrowia jest świetną zabawą, po prostu dodanie do obiadu dodatkowej filiżanki warzywa, takiego jak pieczone brokuły, może pomóc skierować igłę w pozytywnym kierunku”. *—**Marisa Moore**, MBA, RDN, L.D., dietetyk kulinarny i integracyjny*\r\n\r\n## 12. Pomiń „zdrową wersję” i zjedz jedzenie, którego tak naprawdę pragniesz.\r\n\r\n„Nie ma potrzeby narażania kubków smakowych na kompromisy dzięki „alternatywnym” pokarmom, ponieważ mówi się nam, że są one zdrowsze – ciasto na ciasteczka z ciecierzycy, cokolwiek z kalafiora, ciasteczka z czarną fasolą. Kiedy mówi się nam, że nie możemy mieć prawdziwej rzeczy lub czujemy, że musimy „zdrowie” wszystko, mamy tendencję do myślenia wyłącznie o tych wyeliminowanych produktach spożywczych i myślimy, że mamy obsesję lub uzależnienie od jedzenia. Zamiast tego daj sobie pozwolenie na spożywanie pokarmów, które lubisz, w tym tych, których pragniesz”. —*Shana Minei Spence, MS, RDN, CDN*\r\n\r\n## 13. Szukaj fitoskładników. (No wiesz, rośliny!)\r\n\r\n„Fitoskładniki odżywcze to związki chemiczne wytwarzane przez rośliny i wiadomo, że są korzystne dla ludzi, ponieważ zawierają przeciwutleniacze, które pomagają chronić organizm przed uszkodzeniem przez wolne rodniki. Owoce takie jak jagody są doskonałym źródłem składników odżywczych – jagody zawierają antocyjany i flawanole, które zostały dokładnie przebadane pod kątem ich zdolności kardioprotekcyjnych. Można je spożywać świeże lub mrożone i dodawać zarówno do słodkich, jak i słonych dań. Lub dopraw swoje posiłki czosnkiem i cebulą. Prawidłowo przechowywane mają długi okres trwałości.” —*Maya Feller, MS, R.D., CDN*\r\n\r\n## 14. Jedz, gdy jesteś głodny.\r\n\r\n„Twoje ciało nie działa na zegarze. Jedz, gdy jesteś głodny. Słyszałem, że niektórzy ludzie są głodni w godzinach porannych, ale myślą, że nie powinni jeść, ponieważ oficjalnie nie jest pora lunchu. Jeśli jesteś głodny o 11 rano, wiedz, że możesz jeść. Nasze ciała i ich potrzeby zmieniają się codziennie (z powodu hormonów, ruchu, aktywności itp.). Więc tylko dlatego, że zjadłeś o 13:00. wczoraj nie oznacza, że ​​coś jest z tobą nie tak, jeśli dziś potrzebujesz jedzenia. Nie jesteśmy robotami ani maszynami, które uruchamiają się z autopilota, naprawdę jesteśmy ludźmi”. —*Shana Minei Spence, MS, RDN, CDN*\r\n\r\n## 15. Przygotuj partiami zboża i warzywa, a następnie mieszaj i dopasowuj je przez cały tydzień.\r\n\r\n„To praktyczna wskazówka, która ułatwia tworzenie posiłków przez cały tydzień bez powtarzania tego samego przepisu pięć razy. Ugotuj ryż lub komosę ryżową i piecz warzywa luzem, abyś mógł łatwo dodać ulubione białko na szybki lunch lub kolację w ciągu tygodnia. Wymieszaj i dopasuj, aby było ciekawie — wrzuć pieczone warzywa do pizzy jednego wieczoru, a następnego podawaj z łososiem. Lubię też gotować partię jajek na początku tygodnia, aby przez cały tydzień używać ich jako przekąsek i śniadań.” —*Marisa Moore, MBA RDN L.D.*\r\n\r\n## 16. Stwórz dla siebie nowe tradycje kulinarne.\r\n\r\n„Żywność jest silnie związana ze wspomnieniami i doświadczeniami, ale kiedy nasze nawyki żywieniowe są silnie napędzane dietą lub dietą, mamy tendencję do zatracania tych tradycji. Przypomnij sobie niektóre ze swoich pozytywnych wspomnień związanych z jedzeniem i zobacz, czy możesz je odtworzyć lub odtworzyć w nowych tradycjach. Może to być tak proste, jak wybranie nowego przepisu raz w tygodniu i opracowanie zupełnie nowego sposobu obchodzenia ważnych świąt. Może to być wzmacniający i satysfakcjonujący sposób na celebrowanie żywności przekraczającej jej możliwości żywieniowe i tworzenie nowej kultury żywieniowej, która nie wiąże się z dietą ani ograniczeniami”. —*Cara Harbstreet, MS R.D.L.D.*\r\n\r\n## 17. Dodawaj świeże zioła w zasadzie do wszystkiego.\r\n\r\n„Oleje naturalnie obecne w świeżych ziołach, takich jak bazylia, pietruszka i oregano, dodają dużo smaku. Dwie łyżki świeżej bazylii dostarczają około 25% witaminy K, której potrzebujesz w ciągu dnia. A świeża natka pietruszki to nie tylko przybranie — to doskonałe źródło witamin A i C oraz doskonałe źródło witaminy K. (Ponad 75% dziennej dawki dziennej w jednej łyżce stołowej!) Obficie dodawaj świeże zioła do sałatek, dodaj ziołowy vinaigrette do skropienia na rybach lub dodaj je do wody”. —*Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, L.D.*\r\n\r\n## 18. Trzymaj w zapasie składniki do dań ze spiżarni. \r\n\r\n„Miej pod ręką składniki na kilka smacznych i pożywnych posiłków ze spiżarni. W ten sposób, w dni, w których nie masz szansy iść do sklepu spożywczego lub nie masz ochoty gotować niczego skomplikowanego, nadal masz opcje. Moim ulubionym jest makaron z ciecierzycą w puszkach i mrożonym szpinakiem smażonym z dużą ilością cebuli, czosnku i płatków chili”. —*Rachael Hartley, RD*\r\n\r\n## 19. Usuń lub wycisz swoje aplikacje do śledzenia żywności.\r\n\r\n„To jedna z najprostszych, ale najtrudniejszych wskazówek. Możemy coraz bardziej polegać na aplikacjach kierujących decyzjami żywieniowymi, ale to tworzy fałszywe poczucie bezpieczeństwa. Dlatego rozważenie ich usunięcia może być tak niepewne. To jeden z najważniejszych kroków do ponownego połączenia się z głodem i pełnią oraz nauczenia się ufać swojemu ciału.” —*Cara Harbstreet, MS, R.D., L.D.*\r\n\r\n## 20. Jedz dowolne posiłki, kiedy tylko zechcesz.\r\n\r\n„Zgub etykiety. Czy zauważyłeś, jak łatwo kategoryzujemy jedzenie na „śniadanie/lunch/kolacja”? Ten sposób myślenia może cię powstrzymać. Część ciebie opowiada historię „Nie mogę…”, na przykład „Nie mogę tego zjeść na śniadanie”. Niektóre z moich ulubionych śniadań przypominają bardziej lunch – kawałek obfitego tostu z majonezem, pomidorem, bazylią, na przykład sól i pieprz. Podobnie serowe jajka zawinięte w tortillę z dowolnym warzywem, które mam pod ręką, to dla mnie szybka kolacja. Następnie dodam boczki owoców lub moją ulubioną miskę płatków zbożowych lub deser, w zależności od moich pragnień.” —*Rebecca Scritchfield, RDN, autorka* Body Kindness\r\n\r\n## 21. Piecz mrożone warzywa, aby uzyskać łatwy i pyszny dodatek.\r\n\r\n„Uwielbiam mrożone warzywa. Mogą być bardzo przystępne cenowo i trwać przez chwilę w zamrażarce. Moją ulubioną rzeczą jest ładowanie mrożonych brukselek, zielonej fasoli, brokułów, groszku i marchewki i po prostu wrzucanie ich do potraw, aby dodać smaku i konsystencji. Frytownica powietrzna jest moim ulubionym gadżetem kuchennym, więc pieczę tam dużo tych warzyw polanych oliwą z oliwek, solą czosnkową i parmezanem. Możesz też upiec je w piekarniku na złoty kolor. Taki przyjemny dla tłumu i super szybki do zrobienia. ” —*Dalina Soto M.A., R.D., L.D.N.*\r\n\r\n## 22. Regularnie przygotowywaj posiłki, ale staraj się nie stresować tym.\r\n\r\n„Miej niezawodną rutynę przygotowywania posiłków, aby uniknąć nadmiernego myślenia, co może prowadzić do spirali niepotrzebnego stresu i niepokoju związanego z jedzeniem. I bądź elastyczny w tym, co uważasz za „wystarczająco dobre” przygotowanie posiłku, biorąc pod uwagę zasoby czasu i pieniędzy. Na przykład w piątkowe wieczory staram się ustawić minutnik na 30 minut i mieć pod ręką notatnik. Otwieram lodówkę i zamrażarkę, wrzucam spleśniałe rzeczy do kompostowania, szybko przygotowuję świeże warzywa, które mogą być na ostatnim udźcu (zwykle przez smażenie, pieczenie lub robienie szybkiej bazy do chili lub zupy) i siekam wszelkie owoce do zamrożenia i wykorzystania później z pieczonymi płatkami owsianymi lub koktajlami.\r\n\r\nPo tym sprincie zwykle mam kilka pomysłów na kolejny zestaw posiłków i ulubionych do uzupełnienia. Czas, który zainwestowałem w mniej niż doskonałe przygotowanie z wyprzedzeniem, zwraca się w postaci dywidendy, kiedy spędzam pracowity tydzień i jedyne, co muszę zrobić, to sięgnąć po coś, co jest praktycznie przygotowane, i wziąć to na talerz. Daje mi to czas na uważne jedzenie i delektowanie się smakiem!” *—Rebecca Scritchfield, RDN*\r\n\r\n## 23. W razie wątpliwości połóż na nim trochę owoców i orzechów.\r\n\r\n„Dodaj świeże owoce do gałki lodów lub sorbetu lub świeże owoce i orzechy (takie jak migdały lub orzeszki ziemne) do gałki lodów, aby uzyskać dodatkowy błonnik i białko, abyś czuł się bardziej zadowolony. Osobiście uwielbiam dodawać mango, jagody i pokrojone migdały do ​​mojego słodkiego przysmaku. I *uwielbiam* mieszać granola i masło orzechowe z moimi owocowymi koktajlami. Dostajesz mieszankę zdrowych tłuszczów i więcej błonnika, które pomogą Ci zachować sytość przez dłuższy czas. Świetnie nadaje się również na śniadanie na wynos”. —[*Yasi Ansari**, MS, R.D., CSSD, rzecznik prasowy Akademii Żywienia i Dietetyki w krajowych mediach oraz zastępca dyrektora ds. żywienia wyczynowego w UC Berkeley Athletics*\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:22:53', '2021-03-10 19:39:23', '/resources/images/woman_food_donut.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/20-ways-to-eat-healthier', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (58, 11, '10 zasad zdrowego odżywiania, które możesz natychmiast wyrzucić.md', 'Who decided “Don\'t eat after 8 p.m.” made sense, anyway?', '﻿![Mixed race woman holding colorful french cookies](https://media.self.com/photos/6001cbe80ea3ae085f6aa8f6/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/woman_macaron.jpeg)Lucas Ottone/Adobe Stock\r\n\r\nArbitralne zasady żywieniowe są wszechobecne w naszym społeczeństwie dzięki kulturze żywieniowej i wypaczonym poglądom na to, czym właściwie jest „zdrowe odżywianie”. Zasady te często manifestują się jako konkretne polecenia i ogólne maksymy dotyczące tego, co, kiedy i jak powinniśmy jeść.\r\n\r\nNiektóre z tych zasad żywieniowych są sugestiami opartymi na dobrych intencjach i rzeczywiście mogą być naprawdę pomocne – dla niektórych osób, czasami – gdy są używane jako zasady przewodnie, w przeciwieństwie do twardych i szybkich zasad. Ale wiele zasad dotyczących jedzenia to, szczerze mówiąc, całkowite B.S. Są niepotrzebnie restrykcyjne, nierealistyczne lub nienaukowe – i często potencjalnie szkodliwe dla twojego związku z jedzeniem.\r\n\r\nProblem polega na tym, że zasady są z definicji uniwersalne, podczas gdy wiemy, że zdrowe odżywianie nie jest niczym innym. Nasze różne ciała, potrzeby żywieniowe, gusta, kultura, historia medyczna, dostęp do żywności, budżety i styl życia wpływają na najlepsze wybory żywieniowe dla każdej osoby. Tak więc naturalnie wynika z tego, że sztywne, ogólne zasady dotyczące jedzenia nie będą działać dla wszystkich.\r\n\r\nMając to na uwadze, rozmawialiśmy z kilkoma specjalistami ds. rozwoju o zasadach żywieniowych, które chcieliby, aby ludzie zdali sobie sprawę, że mogą faktycznie wyrzucić – lub przynajmniej być o wiele bardziej elastycznym. Poprosiliśmy ich również o wyjaśnienie, dlaczego dokładnie uważają, że te zasady warto ignorować (poza tym, że zasady są po prostu do bani). Przygotuj się na dodanie kilku pozycji do listy Things IDGAF About.\r\n\r\n## 1. „Unikaj przetworzonej żywności”.\r\n\r\n„Ta zasada jest niespójna i niekoniecznie pomocna w dokonywaniu najlepszych wyborów żywieniowych”, Marina Chaparro, RD, MPH, certyfikowana edukatorka diabetologiczna, założycielka Nutrichicos i autorka *Cukrzyca i ciąża: prawdziwy przewodnik dla kobiet z typem 1, Typ 2 i cukrzyca ciążowa* mówi SELF. W świecie żywności jest mnóstwo szumu wokół słowa „przetworzone”, ale według Agencji ds. Żywności i Leków wszystko to *naprawdę* oznacza, że ​​żywność została połączona z co najmniej jednym innym składnikiem lub zmieniona w dowolnym drogi od stanu naturalnego (np. puszkowane, mieszane, krojone, pasteryzowane). Więc „chyba że jesteś na diecie surowej, w której niczego nie gotujesz, spożywasz żywność przetworzoną” – wyjaśnia Chaparro. Wskazuje, że obejmuje to produkty bogate w składniki odżywcze, takie jak jogurt, pieczywo pełnoziarniste, masło migdałowe i wędzony łosoś. „Zamiast unikać przetworzonej żywności, skupiłbym się na uczeniu ludzi, jak czytać etykiety i nie generalizowaniu żywności jako dobrej lub złej”. (Myślenie o niektórych produktach spożywczych jako „dobre”, a innych jako „złe” jest zasadniczo przypisywaniem jedzeniu wartości moralnej, co może sprawić, że poczujesz się jak zła *osoba* za zjedzenie czegoś, co wydaje się „zbyt przetworzone” lub w inny sposób niezdrowe).\r\n\r\n## 2. „Sklep na obwodzie”.\r\n\r\nJeśli nie słyszałeś wcześniej o tej zasadzie żywieniowej, oto sedno sprawy: ta zasada zakupów spożywczych ma na celu nakłonienie ludzi do dodawania większej ilości produktów i świeżej żywności do ich diety. Zazwyczaj znajdują się one w przejściach na obrzeżach sklepu, podczas gdy inne produkty (takie jak pakowane przekąski i mrożonki) zwykle znajdują się pośrodku. Dodawanie większej ilości produktów i świeżej żywności do koszyka, jeśli to możliwe, może być świetne. Jednak zasada ta błaga również ludzi, aby trzymali zapakowaną i stabilną na półce żywność z dala od wózków, Cara Harbstreet, MS, R.D., L.D. Street Smart Nutrition, mówi SELF. „W rzeczywistości jest to nierealistyczny sposób robienia zakupów i gotowania dla wielu osób, które zwracają uwagę na wygodę, przystępność cenową i smak potraw znajdujących się w wewnętrznych przejściach”, mówi.\r\n\r\nCo więcej, „Jeśli robisz zakupy tylko na obwodzie w supermarkecie, stracisz ryż, owies, fasolę i wiele innych pożywnych produktów spożywczych”, mówi SELF Marisa Moore, MBA, RDN, LD, dietetyk kulinarny i integracyjny. . „Chociaż rozumiem zamiar, to ogranicza”. Sprawia to również wrażenie, że mrożone owoce i warzywa – jedne z ulubionych produktów oszczędzających czas Moore, znajdujące się w środkowych alejkach na jej rynku – nie są nawet warte rozważenia, gdy w rzeczywistości są one pełne składników odżywczych i często więcej. przystępne cenowo niż ich świeże odpowiedniki.\r\n\r\nTa zasada jest *szczególnie* niewykonalna w erze koronawirusa, podkreśla Harbstreet, kiedy wiele osób chce lub musi ograniczyć swoje wizyty w sklepie z powodu COVID-19. Jej rady? „Rzuć tę przestarzałą poradę i przygotuj listę zakupów w oparciu o to, czego potrzebujesz — w tym pakowane i stabilne produkty spożywcze”.\r\n\r\n## 3. „Nie jedz po godzinie X.”\r\n\r\nNiektórzy ludzie przestają jeść w określonym czasie, ponieważ słyszeli, że jedzenie przed snem jest dla ciebie złe. Ale o ile jedzenie przed snem nie powoduje niestrawności, nie jest tak naprawdę z natury gorsze dla twojego ciała, jak wcześniej donosiło SELF. Bardziej do rzeczy jest fakt, że dla wielu z nas nasze harmonogramy po prostu nie sprzyjają skończeniu jedzenia przed godziną 18, 19 lub 20. „Wiele osób je obiad bardzo wcześnie i kładzie się spać bardzo późno, więc naturalne jest, że potrzebują [jedzenia], ponieważ twoje ciało nadal potrzebuje energii, gdy nie śpi”, Dalina Soto MA, RD, LDN, dwujęzyczna dietetyczka i założycielka Nutritiously Yours and Your Latina Nutrition, mówi SELF.\r\n\r\nInni wprowadzają limit czasowy, aby pokrzyżować im apetyt na przekąskę, „złe” jedzenie do późnych godzin nocnych. „Ciekawe jest to, że ta arbitralna zasada może w rzeczywistości przyczyniać się do twoich nocnych zachcianek” — mówi SELF Vincci Tsui, RD, dietetyk przeciwny dietetyce i certyfikowany doradca ds. intuicyjnego żywienia. „Wszyscy wiemy, że im więcej mówimy sobie, że czegoś nie możemy mieć, tym bardziej tego chcemy, prawda?” Kiedy dasz sobie pozwolenie na pójście do kuchni o każdej porze, nocne przekąski mogą stać się mniej „niegrzeczne” i kuszące.\r\n\r\n## 4. „Nie jedz emocjonalnie”.  \r\n\r\nFaktem jest, że często jedzenie *jest* emocjonalne, Lindsay Birchfield MS, RD, LD, aktywistka zdrowia i ciała oraz dietetyk w tworzeniu pokoju z żywnością i zakorzenioną opieką zdrowotną serca. „Jemy, by świętować i jemy, by opłakiwać”, mówi.\r\n\r\nJedzenie dla komfortu emocjonalnego jest problematyczne, ale w rzeczywistości jest bardzo podobne do większości innych mechanizmów radzenia sobie: narzędzie, które ma pomóc ci przetrwać, radzić sobie ze stresem i czuć się lepiej. „[Jedzenie emocjonalne] to po prostu kolejny sposób na szukanie pocieszenia, gdy jest to potrzebne” – mówi SELF Kimmie Singh, MS, RD, założycielka The Body Positive Dietitian. „Częścią zdrowego związku z jedzeniem jest przyzwolenie na emocjonalne jedzenie, gdy jest to pomocne”, wyjaśnia Singh, dodając, „pyszne jedzenie może być wspaniałym źródłem przyjemności i komfortu podczas doświadczania bolesnych emocji”. Jest to szczególnie aktualne w przypadku pandemii koronawirusa, która na wiele sposobów zakłóciła dynamikę wielu ludzi związanych z jedzeniem, w tym ograniczając dostęp ludzi do żywności, wywołując zaburzenia zachowań żywieniowych i skłaniając wielu do szukania pocieszenia w postaci czegoś, co dobrze smakuje.\r\nTo powiedziawszy, jedzenie nie powinno być twoim jedynym mechanizmem radzenia sobie. Singh zaleca szukanie wsparcia u dostawcy zdrowia psychicznego, jeśli masz problemy z dostępem do innych narzędzi. Znalezienie dostawcy zdrowia psychicznego, który jest niedrogi, dostępny i wyrozumiały w sposób, w jaki potrzebujesz, może być trudne w „zwykłych” czasach, a tym bardziej teraz. Oto kilka wskazówek, jak znaleźć dla siebie odpowiedniego terapeutę, kilka dodatkowych wskazówek na ten sam temat, a także kilka wskazówek, jak umówić się na dobrą wizytę teleterapeutyczną.\r\n\r\n## 5. „Gotuj od podstaw, aby jeść zdrowiej”.\r\n\r\n„Istnieje taki pomysł, że aby dobrze się odżywiać i być zdrowym, wszystko musi być zrobione od podstaw, a to po prostu nieprawda” – mówi Moore. Przygotowana, gotowa i mrożona żywność może w rzeczywistości sprawić, że wybory żywieniowe będą bardziej realistyczne dla ludzi, Veronica E. Garnett, MS, R.D., zarejestrowana dietetyczka i kulinarna Health at Every Size and Fat-positive, mówi SELF. Garnett poleca „pożywne i pyszne oszczędzacze czasu”, takie jak na przykład kurczaki z rożna, szybki ryż, zestawy do sałatek i torby z mrożonymi warzywami, które można podgrzewać w kuchence mikrofalowej. „Kiedy masz na to ochotę i masz czas, zdecydowanie stwórz swoje ulubione dzieła od podstaw” — mówi Garnett. „Ale wiedz, że nie ma absolutnie nic złego w uzyskaniu pomocy ze sklepu spożywczego”.\r\n\r\n## 6. „Nie przesadzaj ze słodkimi owocami”.\r\n\r\n„Jest to tak powszechnie przyjęte przekonanie, że owoce są zbyt bogate w cukier i muszą być dla ciebie„ złe ”, Erica Leon, MS, RDN, CDN, terapeuta żywieniowy, certyfikowany dietetyk zarejestrowany w zaburzeniach odżywiania i założyciel Erica Leon Nutrition , mówi SELF. Tak, owoce zawierają cukier. Ale zapewnia również błonnik i szereg niezbędnych witamin i minerałów, mówi Leon, nie wspominając o soczystym smaku. Ten błonnik pomaga ci się napełnić, jednocześnie spowalniając tempo wchłaniania cukru z owoców, wyjaśnia Leon – co pomaga utrzymać poziom cukru we krwi i energii na bardziej stabilnym poziomie niż, powiedzmy, równoważna ilość cukru stołowego. Zjedz owoce.\r\n\r\n## 7. „Wypij szklankę wody, gdy jesteś głodny”.\r\n\r\nPragnienie wymaga nawodnienia; głód wzywa do jedzenia. „Ta zasada służy do tłumienia głodu i chociaż może utrzymywać cię przez chwilowe uczucie sytości, ciało w końcu zorientuje się, że do organizmu nie dostaje się żadna energia” – certyfikowana doradczyni ds. intuicyjnego odżywiania, Carolina Guízar, MS, RDN, CDN, założycielka Eathority i współzałożyciel Latinx Health Collective, mówi SELF. A teraz jesteś *naprawdę* głodny. „Im dłużej zwlekasz z karmieniem swojego ciała, tym bardziej będziesz głodny, a to może sprawić, że zaczniesz jeść w sposób, który wydaje się „poza kontrolą” — wyjaśnia Guízar. Co więcej, „Ten nawyk może potencjalnie zmniejszyć zaufanie twojego ciała do ciebie, jeśli chodzi o regularne odżywianie”. Więc na wszelki wypadek bądź nawodniony. Ale kiedy jesteś głodny, jedz.\r\n\r\n## 8. „Zawsze wybieraj całe ziarno”.\r\n\r\nProdukty pełnoziarniste to niesamowita rzecz, którą można włączyć do swojej diety – zazwyczaj oferują więcej błonnika, białka i obfitej konsystencji niż ich wyrafinowane odpowiedniki. Ale to nie znaczy, że musimy potępiać oczyszczone zboża na wieczność. „Jedzenie zwykłego makaronu lub białego ryżu, a nie alternatywy o wyższej zawartości błonnika, nie oznacza, że ​​posiłek nie jest „zdrowy” – Yasi Ansari, MS, RD, CSSD, rzecznik prasowy w krajowych mediach Akademii Żywienia i Dietetyki oraz zastępca dyrektora ds. żywienia wyczynowego dla UC Berkeley Athletics, mówi SELF. Jeśli naprawdę chcesz na przykład białego chleba, jak bardzo będziesz zadowolony po zjedzeniu chleba pełnoziarnistego? W każdym razie, co ważniejsze pod względem żywieniowym, jest zbilansowanie posiłku jako całości. „Istnieje wiele sposobów na dodanie do posiłku większej ilości białka, tłuszczów i błonnika, aby uzyskać więcej składników odżywczych” – wyjaśnia Ansari – pomyśl o fasoli, warzywach, orzechach, nabiale i mięsie lub białku roślinnym.\r\n\r\n## 9. „Wytnij węglowodany”.\r\n\r\nW przemyśle dietetycznym makroskładniki są modne i wychodzą z mody, mimo że „wszystkie nasze makroskładniki są niezbędne dla procesów biologicznych” – wyjaśnia Birchfield. Ostatnio wpływ diet gloryfikujących tłuszcz i demonizujących węglowodany (takich jak keto lub paleo) doprowadził do szeroko rozpowszechnionego założenia, że mniej węglowodanów jest lepszych, ogólnie rzecz biorąc. Bynajmniej! „Węglowodany są świetne i powinny być traktowane jak każdy inny makroskładnik” – mówi Ansari. „Dostarczają nam wydajnego i łatwego w użyciu paliwa, którego nasz organizm potrzebuje zarówno do sprawności umysłowej, jak i fizycznej”, w tym podstawowych funkcji organizmu, codziennych czynności i ćwiczeń. Bez wystarczającej ilości węglowodanów z żywności, takiej jak zboża, owoce, warzywa skrobiowe, fasola i rośliny strączkowe, „narażamy się na ryzyko gromadzenia się energii” – mówi Ansari – co naprawdę utrudnia bycie najlepszym w codziennym życiu. Ansari dodaje, że węglowodany często zawierają błonnik, witaminy i minerały, których organizm naprawdę potrzebuje.\r\n\r\n## 10. „Zawsze siadaj przy stole do jedzenia”.\r\n\r\nPriorytetowe siadanie i bycie wystarczająco obecnym, aby naprawdę cieszyć się posiłkiem, może sprawić, że jedzenie stanie się przyjemniejszym i bardziej znaczącym doświadczeniem, mówi Guízar. Ale „Chociaż byłoby miło, gdybyśmy zawsze mieli czas, aby usiąść i delektować się naszymi posiłkami, po prostu nierealne jest robienie tego przez cały czas”, mówi. „W rzeczywistości [niektóre] posiłki będą bałaganiarskie i pospieszne, i to jest w porządku”. Jeśli brzmi to jak twoja codzienność, nie trzymaj się standardu, który nie pasuje do twojego stylu życia lub sprawia, że czujesz się źle, gdy go nie spełniasz. Stanie przy ladzie, przy biurku między Zoomami, w biegu, gdy idziesz do pracy jako niezbędny pracownik – „To nadal liczy się jako posiłek”, jak mówi Guízar.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:24:16', '2021-03-10 19:42:45', '/resources/images/woman_macaron.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/food-rules-to-stop-following', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (59, 9, '40 wskazówek dotyczących oczyszczania mieszkania.md', '', '﻿![img](/resources/images/shutterstock_1093498739.jpg)\r\n\r\nWszyscy mamy z tym do czynienia w pewnym momencie naszego życia. Niekończący się bałagan może wydawać się przytłaczający, zwłaszcza w małych mieszkaniach. Zamiast zazdrościć uporządkowanym przyjaciołom, którzy zdają się go opanować, skorzystaj z tych wskazówek, aby nadać swojemu mieszkaniu kształt.\r\n\r\n## Korzyści z oczyszczania\r\n\r\nUsuwanie śmieci może wydawać się obowiązkiem przypominającym nasze dzieciństwo. Ma to jednak swoje zalety.\r\n\r\nNie tylko łatwiej jest posprzątać mieszkanie, gdy nie ma bałaganu, ale także jesteś mniej zestresowany. Nagle możesz znaleźć wszystko, czego potrzebujesz, a Twoje miejsce jest niesamowite. Przeczytaj nasze najlepsze wskazówki, jak zacząć!\r\n\r\n## 1. Pozbądź się bałaganu w ustalonych okresach czasu\r\n\r\nZajęcie się całym mieszkaniem w jeden dzień może być przytłaczające. Zamiast tego usuwaj bałagan w określonych odstępach czasu. Ustaw sobie zegar i pracuj nad jednym obszarem przez 10 lub 15 minut, a następnie zrób sobie przerwę lub zakończ do jutra.\r\n\r\n## 2. Regularnie przekazuj przedmioty\r\n\r\nPrzekazywanie przedmiotów to świetny sposób na przekazywanie rzeczy potrzebującym. Wyznacz każdy tydzień tematem darowizny, od mebli po sypialnię lub kuchnię. Zrzuć przedmioty lub umów się na odbiór z Goodwill lub ulubionej organizacji charytatywnej.\r\n\r\n## 3. Utwórz listę kontrolną usuwania zanieczyszczeń\r\n\r\nZamiast kręcić kołami i skakać od zadania do zadania, skorzystaj z listy kontrolnej. Zaprojektuj go wokół określonego pokoju lub obszaru swojego mieszkania i odhaczaj swoją listę po drodze.\r\n\r\n## 4. Wyznacz sobie cele\r\n\r\nWyznaczanie celów może pomóc w radzeniu sobie z dużymi projektami porządkowymi i jednocześnie czuć się spełnionym. Wyznaczaj cele na podstawie ilości. Na przykład powiedz sobie: „Dzisiaj wypełnię cały worek na śmieci rzeczami do przekazania”.\r\n\r\n## 5. Zarządzaj swoją papierkową robotą\r\n\r\nPapierkowa robota eskaluje bałagan i wciąż się nawarstwia. Wyznacz dzień tygodnia na niszczenie i sortowanie poczty i innych przedmiotów.\r\n\r\nZajmowanie się papierkową robotą to także dobry czas na wypisanie się z katalogów, list mailingowych i przejście na rozliczanie bez papieru.\r\n\r\n## 6. Przestań traktować swój dom jak magazyn\r\n\r\nTo, że twoje mieszkanie może coś przechowywać, nie oznacza, że ​​powinno. Usuń rzeczy, których już nie używasz. Sprzedaj, podaruj i traktuj swoje mieszkanie bardziej jak w domu.\r\n\r\n## 7. Zrób zdjęcia przed i po\r\n\r\nUsuwanie zanieczyszczeń może być długim procesem, a rezultaty nie zawsze są widoczne. Rób zdjęcia przed i po, aby zobaczyć swoje postępy i pozostać zmotywowanym wynikami ciężkiej pracy.\r\n\r\n## 8. Skorzystaj z „Metody 4 pudełek”\r\n\r\nMetoda czterech pudełek może pomóc zawęzić bałagan i stworzyć system, co dalej. Chwyć cztery pudełka i odpowiednio je oznacz:\r\n\r\n- Śmieci\r\n- Oddaj\r\n- Trzymać\r\n- Przenieś\r\n\r\nPamiętaj jednak, aby przestrzegać prostej zasady: jeśli nie używałeś jej od roku, podaruj ją lub pozbądź się!\r\n\r\n## 9. Poproś o pomoc rodzinę i przyjaciół\r\n\r\nWszyscy możemy skorzystać z pewnego wsparcia w naszych celach porządkowych i organizacyjnych. Poproś członka rodziny lub przyjaciela o pomoc i zamień to w imprezę. Słuchaj muzyki, zamawiaj pizzę i nadrabiaj zaległości, zanim zamienisz mieszkania i uporasz się z cudzym bałaganem.\r\n\r\nMożesz także poprosić swoją sieć o poradę przez Zoom lub FaceTime, aby zapytać, jak poradzić sobie z celami oczyszczania.\r\n\r\n## 10. Wypróbuj zasadę „jeden wszedł, jeden wyszedł”\r\n\r\nKawalerki i małe przestrzenie wymagają podstawowych zasad, jeśli chodzi o wnoszenie większej ilości rzeczy. Za każdym razem, gdy kupujesz coś nowego, zobowiąż się do przekazania darowizny lub pozbywania się czegoś innego. Teraz w Twoim mieszkaniu nie będzie nadmiaru rzeczy, a Ty zachowasz kontrolę.\r\n\r\n## 11. Wypróbuj zasadę 90 dni\r\n\r\nSchowaj swoje sezonowe przedmioty, a następnie spójrz na to, co zostało. Jeśli nie używałeś lub nie nosiłeś przedmiotu przez 90 dni, rozważ podarowanie go lub wyrzucenie go w całości. Szanse są duże, że nigdy tego nie przegapisz.\r\n\r\n## 12. Zobacz swój dom jako gość\r\n\r\nSpójrz na swój dom świeżymi oczami i zastanów się, co odwiedzający zobaczy jako pierwszy. Przejrzyj każdy pokój i sporządź listę tego, jaki bałagan się wyróżnia i jak możesz go rozwiązać.\r\n\r\n## 13. Bądź innowacyjny dzięki rozwiązaniom do przechowywania\r\n\r\nNawet przytulne mieszkania mogą skorzystać na małych rozwiązaniach do przechowywania. Wiszące kosze na ręczniki i skarpetki mogą pomóc w uporządkowaniu szafy lub komody.\r\n\r\nStojak na talerze eksponuje naczynia i pomaga uporządkować szafki. A pegboard pomaga wieszać gadżety, przybory i inne przedmioty.\r\n\r\n## 14. Polegaj na technologii\r\n\r\nIstnieje wiele sposobów, w jakie technologia pomaga zmniejszyć bałagan i zmaksymalizować przestrzeń w mieszkaniu. Skanuj stare zdjęcia i rozdawaj lub wyrzucaj albumy ze zdjęciami.\r\n\r\nSprzedaj swoją kolekcję płyt DVD lub CD i zamiast tego polegaj na rozwiązaniach cyfrowych. Im więcej możesz przechowywać na swoich urządzeniach i w chmurze, tym mniej zagracona będzie Twoja fizyczna przestrzeń.\r\n\r\n## 15. Uzyskaj wielofunkcyjność\r\n\r\nPrzytulne apartamenty potrzebują tyle miejsca, ile tylko mogą. Dlatego zachowaj wielofunkcyjność mebli.\r\n\r\nZmniejsz bałagan za pomocą stolika kawowego lub otomany z ukrytym schowkiem. Następnie schowaj czasopisma, dokumenty i sznurki, aby nie były widoczne.\r\n\r\n## 16. Obejmij minimalizm\r\n\r\nUsuwanie zaśmiecania często dotyczy zmiany sposobu myślenia, a nie pozbycia się swoich rzeczy. Przyjmij ideę minimalizmu, w którym wszystko służy celowi, a Ty jesteś wolny od sprzątania i dbania o tak wiele rzeczy. Zmniejsz ilość rzeczy w swoim mieszkaniu i ciesz się wolnością, jaką daje to Twojemu życiu.\r\n\r\n## 17. Myśl na małą skalę\r\n\r\nDuże meble nie wyświadczają Twojemu mieszkaniu żadnych korzyści, jeśli chodzi o bałagan. Zmniejsz ilość rzeczy, skupiając się na mniejszych kawałkach. Wybierz fotele miłosne, mniejsze krzesła lub wyściełane krzesła składane, aby uczynić swój salon bardziej przestronnym.\r\n\r\n## 18. Wykorzystaj przestrzeń na ścianie\r\n\r\nWykorzystaj przestrzeń na ścianie, aby pomóc Ci pozbyć się bałaganu. Powiesić foldery i segregować dokumenty i inne przedmioty. Możesz także całkowicie zrezygnować z telewizora i użyć projektora cyfrowego do oglądania telewizji bezpośrednio na ścianie.\r\n\r\n## 19. Zmniejsz liczbę duplikatów\r\n\r\nIle kubków do kawy, ręczników dla gości i dodatkowych koców potrzebujesz w swoim mieszkaniu? Zmniejsz liczbę duplikatów i porzuć nadmiar.\r\n\r\nZachowaj wystarczająco dużo dla siebie, współlokatora i kilku gości. Oddaj resztę.\r\n\r\n## 20. Zidentyfikuj ukryte obszary przechowywania dla bałaganu\r\n\r\nTwoje mieszkanie jest prawdopodobnie pełne ukrytych schowków, w których możesz schować swój bałagan. W górnej części szafek można przechowywać kosze i pojemniki na pocztę i artykuły sezonowe.\r\n\r\nPrzestrzeń nad drzwiami sypialni jest również idealnym miejscem na dodatkową półkę na pościel i ręczniki, aby zwolnić miejsce w szafie.\r\n\r\n## 21. Zaangażuj się w strategię „Czyste na bieżąco”\r\n\r\nTonięcie w bałaganie często wynika ze złych nawyków. Zastosuj strategię „sprzątania na bieżąco”, aby zmywać naczynia, sortować pocztę i wyrzucać dodatkowe rzeczy, gdy tylko pojawią się w Twoim mieszkaniu.\r\n\r\n## 22. Wypożycz swoje rzeczy\r\n\r\nPo co kupować fantazyjne ubrania, buty i akcesoria, które będziesz nosić tylko raz lub dwa razy w roku? Wynajmij je zamiast tego. Zmniejszy to ilość przedmiotów zajmujących cenne miejsce w Twojej szafie.\r\n\r\nTo samo można zastosować w przypadku gadżetów kuchennych, sprzętu fotograficznego i zabawek dla dzieci.\r\n\r\n## 23. Złóż to w górę\r\n\r\nWiele rzeczy w Twoim mieszkaniu może się złożyć i schować, aby kontrolować bałagan. Podaruj swój stół kuchenny i zamiast tego dołącz składany stół ścienny.\r\n\r\nTakie samo podejście można zastosować w przypadku przestrzeni biurowej. Dodaj wygodne składane krzesła, które można łatwo przechowywać i zabrać do pracy bez zaśmiecania przestrzeni.\r\n\r\n## 24. Użyj więcej dzielników\r\n\r\nCzasami mamy więcej niż wystarczająco szuflad i szafek, ale nie możemy znaleźć drogi przez bałagan. Zorganizuj się dzięki przegródkom i przegródkom do szuflad, aby oddzielić bałagan i zrozumieć, czego potrzebujesz, a czego nie.\r\n\r\n## 25. Zorganizuj wyprzedaż cyfrową\r\n\r\nCzasami potrzebujemy szturchnięcia, aby rozpocząć szał oczyszczania, jak cel finansowy. Zorganizuj wyprzedaż cyfrową i wymień swoje meble, bibeloty, sprzęt fotograficzny, naczynia i wszystko inne wartościowe na platformach cyfrowych.\r\n\r\nFacebook Marketplace, Nextdoor i OfferUp to strony internetowe, które pomogą Ci pozbyć się swoich rzeczy i jednocześnie zarobić trochę gotówki.\r\n\r\n## 26. Zatrudnij profesjonalistę\r\n\r\nCzasami nie możemy zapanować nad bałaganem bez pomocy profesjonalisty. Zatrudnij profesjonalnego organizatora, który pomoże Ci stworzyć systemy i procesy do obsługi Twoich rzeczy. Odejdziesz z czystszym mieszkaniem i możliwością zrobienia tego samodzielnie.\r\n\r\n## 27. Wyznacz miejsce na bałagan\r\n\r\nTo może być przytłaczające, gdy nie masz miejsca na odłożenie poczty lub dokumentów, z którymi jeszcze nie możesz sobie poradzić. Wyznacz miejsce w mieszkaniu, takie jak kosz lub kosz przy drzwiach, aby schować bałagan.\r\n\r\nNastępnie wybierz dzień tygodnia, aby sobie z tym poradzić. Spraw, by było to zabawne, przygotowując koktajl lub specjalną kawę, gdy masz do czynienia ze śmieciami, aby zamienić je w wydarzenie.\r\n\r\n## 28. Najpierw zajmij się najmniejszymi projektami\r\n\r\nWielkie, śmiałe cele są godne podziwu, ale prawdopodobnie spadną. Zamiast przytłaczać się, posprzątać całą szafę w jeden dzień, skup się najpierw na najmniejszym projekcie.\r\n\r\nNabieraj pewności siebie za każdym razem, gdy sprzątasz półkę lub szafkę w pralni. Następnie przejdź do wielkiego bałaganu w szafie.\r\n\r\n## 29. Zakończ zakupy na miesiąc\r\n\r\nTwój bałagan zacznie dramatycznie znikać, jeśli raz na jakiś czas zrezygnujesz z zakupów. Przestań kupować dodatki poza artykułami spożywczymi i niezbędnymi przedmiotami przez miesiąc. Możesz powtórzyć ten proces kilka razy w roku i obserwować, jak Twoje rzeczy magicznie się porządkują.\r\n\r\n## 30. Rów „Tylko na wszelki wypadek”\r\n\r\nPrzestań unikać tego pudełka lub szuflady ze wszystkimi rzeczami „na wszelki wypadek”. Losowe sznurki, sprzęt, myjki i gadżety należy wyrzucić lub podarować. Twoja przestrzeń nagle znów poczuje się beztroska.\r\n\r\n## 31. Organizuj według funkcji\r\n\r\nUstalenie, co zrobić z bałaganem, zatrzymuje niektórych ludzi w ich śladach. Zacznij organizować każdy obszar według funkcji.\r\n\r\nPółkę przeznacz na papier toaletowy i ręczniki papierowe, szufladę na pastę do zębów i dodatkowe szczoteczki do zębów, a szafę na pościel. Porządkowanie według funkcji pomaga również wiedzieć, gdzie wszystko jest w Twoim mieszkaniu, zamiast tracić czas na szukanie.\r\n\r\n## 32. Włącz organizację do swojego projektu\r\n\r\nMałe przestrzenie, takie jak apartamenty typu studio, potrzebują wsparcia organizacyjnego, aby okiełznać bałagan. Włącz pomysły kontroli bałaganu do swojego projektu małej przestrzeni. Zacznij od podniesienia łóżka i dodania pod nim pojemników do przechowywania, półek na książki lub prowizorycznej szafy.\r\n\r\n## 33. Skup się na produktywności\r\n\r\nNuda i niepokój to jedne z najlepszych momentów na pozbycie się bałaganu i zwiększenie produktywności. Niezależnie od tego, czy masz do czynienia z pandemią, czy jesteś w domu z ograniczonym budżetem, poświęć dodatkowy czas na zajęcie się swoimi rzeczami.\r\n\r\n## 34. Dokumentuj podróż\r\n\r\nCzasami potrzebujemy inspiracji, wsparcia i odpowiedzialności, aby przejść przez wielkie cele związane z oczyszczaniem. Dokumentuj podróż w mediach społecznościowych. Poproś znajomych, aby podzielili się najlepszymi wskazówkami, jak utrzymać porządek i porządek w swoich mieszkaniach.\r\n\r\n## 35. Oczyść spiżarnię\r\n\r\nCzęsto pomijamy nasze spiżarnie, jeśli chodzi o sprzątanie starych. Zainwestuj w hermetyczne pojemniki na żywność i pozbądź się starych toreb, pudeł i przeterminowanych przedmiotów, które chowają się z tyłu spiżarni. Możesz nawet zacząć oszczędzać na jedzeniu, kiedy zobaczysz, co masz.\r\n\r\n## 36. Rozłącz się\r\n\r\nPrawie wszystko w twoim mieszkaniu można powiesić. Przyborniki do butów mogą posprzątać butelki łazienkowe, suszarki do włosów i lokówki. Możesz przypiąć buty do wieszaków na spodnie w swojej szafie.\r\n\r\nKosze z owocami mogą przechowywać żywność w kuchni, pocztę w korytarzu lub ręczniki do rąk w łazience.\r\n\r\n## 37. Podwój swoje rzeczy\r\n\r\nBrudne szafy są trudne do rozwiązania, gdy po prostu nie ma gdzie odłożyć swoich rzeczy. Aby odzyskać swoją przestrzeń, podwój i powieś ciężkie płaszcze na kurtkach. Możesz również przypiąć dwie pary spodni razem na tym samym wieszaku, aby zaoszczędzić miejsce.\r\n\r\n## 38. Oczyść swoje rogi\r\n\r\nWyciśnij każdy centymetr przestrzeni, maksymalizując kąty. Wyczyść je i dodaj półki i schowki zaprojektowane tak, aby pasowały do ​​narożników. Następnie dodaj kosze i kosze, aby schować swój nieestetyczny bałagan.\r\n\r\n## 39. Nagradzaj się\r\n\r\nCałe to oczyszczanie jest ciężką pracą i od czasu do czasu zasługuje na nagrodę. Po wyczyszczeniu szafy zastąp ją kilkoma wysokiej jakości elementami garderoby lub nową parą butów, aby zastąpić dziesiątki wyrzuconych przedmiotów.\r\n\r\n## 40. Regularnie blokuj czas, aby posprzątać swoje mieszkanie\r\n\r\nOczyszczanie nie jest jednorazowym wydarzeniem. Potraktuj to jako cykliczne wydarzenie, które bardziej przypomina maraton niż sprint.\r\n\r\nUstaw sobie przypomnienie w kalendarzu raz w tygodniu, aby uporać się z bałaganem przez zaledwie 30 minut podczas słuchania muzyki. Następnie poświęć kilka razy w roku na gruntowny remont, jak wiosenne porządki lub czystka świąteczna.\r\n\r\n#### Końcowe przemyślenia\r\n\r\nPorządkowanie to coś więcej niż pozbywanie się rzeczy i utrzymywanie porządku. To niesamowite uczucie mieć większą kontrolę nad swoim mieszkaniem i czuć się lepiej w swojej przestrzeni.\r\n\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:24:32', '2021-03-10 19:44:55', '/resources/images/shutterstock_1093498739.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/decluttering-tips', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (60, 9, 'Jak pozbyć się karaluchów w swoim mieszkaniu.md', '', '﻿![img](/resources/images/images_jeshoots-com-__ZMnefoI3k-unsplash-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\nTwoje mieszkanie powinno być twoim azylem, zwłaszcza w tych niespokojnych czasach. To powiedziawszy, plaga karaluchów z pewnością zrujnuje twoje szanse na cieszenie się domem.\r\n\r\nNikt nie chce dzielić swojej kwatery z tymi szkodnikami. Mogą przenosić choroby, wywoływać zaostrzenia alergii i powodować zapach w domu.\r\n\r\n**Musisz działać szybko!**\r\n\r\nKonieczne jest zrozumienie, jak pozbyć się karaluchów w mieszkaniu, a co ważniejsze, jak je powstrzymać. Po pierwsze, powinieneś powiadomić właściciela lub zarządcę nieruchomości o sytuacji i zobaczyć, jak mogą pomóc.\r\n\r\nNiestety, karaluchy mają zasłużoną reputację zarówno trudnych do pozbycia się, jak i pozornie niezniszczalnych. Nie oznacza to jednak, że po inwazji karaluchów nie będziesz w stanie ich wypędzić.\r\n\r\nOto wszystko, co musisz wiedzieć o tym, jak pozbyć się karaluchów w mieszkaniu.\r\n\r\n-Co przyciąga karaluchy?\r\n-Oznaki, że masz karaluchy\r\n-Pozbywanie się karaluchów\r\n-Jak zapobiegać karaluchom?\r\n-Końcowe przemyślenia\r\n\r\n## Co przyciąga karaluchy?\r\n\r\nZanim zagłębisz się w to, jak pozbyć się karaluchów, ważne jest, aby zrozumieć, co je przyciąga. Ta wiedza może nie tylko pomóc w ich uniknięciu w przyszłości, ale może również pomóc w dotarciu do źródła problemu z infestacją.\r\n\r\nSą to dwa najczęstsze sposoby, w jakie najemcy przyciągają karaluchy.\r\n\r\n#### Żywność\r\n\r\nSzkodniki domowe, takie jak karaluchy, potrzebują pożywienia, aby przetrwać. Zazwyczaj karaluchy będą przyciągane do jedzenia w domach.\r\n\r\nNie oznacza to, że nie możesz trzymać jedzenia w mieszkaniu. Oczywiście, że możesz!\r\n\r\nTo *jak* przechowujesz żywność, która może stanowić problem. Jeśli zostawisz jedzenie na wystarczająco długo, przyciągnie ono karaluchy (i potencjalnie inne szkodniki).\r\n\r\nWszystko, od okruchów zaśmiecających półki szafek po naczynia pozostawione na blacie, może służyć jako światło ostrzegawcze dla karaluchów. Przechowywanie żywności powinno być scentralizowane w kuchni, co oznacza, że ​​nawet jeśli zjesz posiłek w innym miejscu jednostki, brudne naczynia i resztki należy natychmiast schować i posprzątać.\r\n\r\n#### Brudne naczynia\r\n\r\nBrudne naczynia mogą również przyciągać karaluchy. Kilka naczyń pozostawionych na noc w zlewie niekoniecznie spowoduje plagę.\r\n\r\nJednak zlewozmywak, który jest wiecznie pełen naczyń z resztkami jedzenia, z pewnością przyciągnie karaluchy. Te potrawy będą nieumyślnie działać jako stałe źródło pożywienia, którego karaluchy potrzebują, aby się rozwijać.\r\n\r\nNależy pamiętać, że naczynia lub opakowania żywności, takie jak pudełka po pizzy lub pojemniki na wynos rozrzucone po mieszkaniu, będą przyciągać karaluchy. Zaniedbanie utrzymania czystości i higieny w mieszkaniu spowoduje plagę. Szkodniki potrzebują jedzenia, wody i wielu kryjówek.\r\n\r\n## Znaki, że masz karaluchy?\r\n\r\nJeśli chcesz działać szybko i skutecznie powstrzymać inwazję, musisz wiedzieć, jak rozpoznać oznaki inwazji karaluchów. Możesz mieć oko na każdą z tych wskazówek. Pomogą ci pozostać o krok przed szkodnikami i szybko je usunąć.\r\n\r\nOto kilka znaków wskazujących, że masz do czynienia z plagą karaluchów.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Widzisz karalucha — martwego lub żywego\r\n\r\nKaraluchy to nocne owady. Często chowają się w ciągu dnia w ciemnych, wilgotnych miejscach.\r\n\r\nCzęsto atakują kuchnię lub inny obszar w nocy, gdy światła są wyłączone. Włączenie światła spowoduje, że stworzenia te szybko się rozproszą, stąd dobrze znana fraza „rozproszyć się jak karaluchy”.\r\n\r\nTo powiedziawszy, jeśli zobaczysz płoć w ciągu dnia, to pewny znak, że masz do czynienia z plagą. Dotyczy to wszystkich karaluchów, martwych, żywych lub niewyklutych. Płoci zostawiają swoje niewyklute jaja. Jeśli zauważysz jakieś brązowe jaja karaluchów w kształcie pigułek, możesz mieć plagę.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Zauważasz odchody płoci\r\n\r\nPłoci, jak wszystkie szkodniki, zostawiają swoje odchody w widocznych miejscach. Te malutkie ciemnobrązowe odchody prawdopodobnie pozostaną w skupiskach. Jednak nawet zobaczenie pojedynczej kropli jest powodem do niepokoju. Pamiętaj, aby dokładnie zdezynfekować każdy obszar, w którym zauważysz odchody.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Karaluchy przynoszą stęchły zapach\r\n\r\nKaraluchy znane są również z wyraźnie stęchłego zapachu, który niosą ze sobą. Możesz zauważyć stęchły, oleisty zapach, którego nie możesz znaleźć nawet po dokładnym czyszczeniu. Ten zapach będzie się nasilał wraz ze wzrostem porażenia. Jeśli zauważyłeś ten zapach przez jakiś czas, prawdopodobnie masz na rękach znaczną infestację.\r\n\r\n## Pozbywanie się karaluchów\r\n\r\nGdy zdasz sobie sprawę z inwazji, powinieneś działać szybko, aby upewnić się, że nie będzie się dalej gnić i rozprzestrzeniać. Oto jak pozbyć się karaluchów w swoim mieszkaniu.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Pułapki kupione w sklepie\r\n\r\nPierwszym krokiem do pozbycia się karaluchów jest kupienie w sklepie pułapek, które mają przyciągać, a następnie zabijać karaluchy. Niektóre z tych pułapek działają poprzez zatruwanie pokarmu, który karaluch przyniesie z powrotem innym karaluchom. Inne to proste lepkie pułapki.\r\n\r\nPo zastawieniu tych pułapek pierwszej nocy, sprawdź je następnego ranka. Jeśli zauważysz, że na jednej pułapce jest mnóstwo karaluchów, może to być oznaką dużej inwazji.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Domowe pułapki\r\n\r\nJeśli nie chcesz chodzić do sklepu, aby kupić pułapki, nie martw się — robienie domowych pułapek może być równie skuteczne. Oto kilka domowych opcji pułapek:\r\n\r\n- **Pułapki na słoiki:** Te pułapki służą do topienia karaluchów, gdy zbliżają się do przynęty pozostawionej na dnie butelki lub słoika. Jako przynętę można użyć dowolnego słodkiego lub tłustego płynu, ale najczęściej polecane jest piwo i wino.\r\n- **Pułapki z taśmą klejącą**: pułapki te, wykorzystując zwykły przedmiot gospodarstwa domowego, taśmę klejącą, chwytają karaluchy na lepkiej stronie taśmy klejącej.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Dokładnie posprzątaj swoje mieszkanie\r\n\r\nJest to jeden z najważniejszych kroków, ponieważ może pomóc odkryć główne kryjówki karaluchów i wyeliminować ich źródła pożywienia.\r\n\r\nPamiętaj o dokładnym czyszczeniu produktami o udowodnionym działaniu odkażającym i dezynfekującym. Karaluchy są nosicielami chorób i mogą powodować choroby! Zacznij od kuchni i przejdź przez resztę mieszkania.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Tępiciele\r\n\r\nW przypadku inwazji karaluchów zawsze należy wezwać tępiciela. Nie można upewnić się, że udało Ci się je wszystkie wyeliminować, nawet jeśli wykonałeś wszystkie kroki, które wymieniliśmy powyżej.\r\n\r\nCi profesjonaliści użyją swoich narzędzi i przemysłowych repelentów i trucizn, aby całkowicie wyeliminować problem. Pamiętaj, aby skontaktować się z właścicielem przed telefonem. Dzieje się tak, ponieważ mogą wymagać od innych najemców opuszczenia lokalu na dłuższy czas.\r\n\r\n## Jak zapobiegać karaluchom\r\n\r\nZawsze lepiej być proaktywnym niż reaktywnym. Oto jak zapobiegać karaluchom w swoim mieszkaniu.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Regularnie sprzątaj mieszkanie\r\n\r\nUtrzymanie mieszkania w czystości to jeden z najskuteczniejszych sposobów zapobiegania karaluchom. Ta metoda usuwa ich źródło pożywienia i zmniejsza szanse, że dostaną się do twojego domu. Upewnij się, że:\r\n\r\n- Odkurz wszystkie obszary\r\n- Zmywać naczynia\r\n- Zamiatać okruchy na podłodze\r\n- Szafki do sprzątania\r\n- Upewnij się, że cała żywność jest prawidłowo przechowywana i zapieczętowana\r\n\r\n#### 2. Uszczelnij wszelkie pęknięcia w ścianach lub podłogach i przecieki\r\n\r\nWiadomo, że karaluchy przedostają się przez nawet najmniejsze otwory, więc zapobieganie im oznacza usunięcie wszystkich ich wejść i wyjść.\r\n\r\nPoproś właściciela lub zarządcę nieruchomości, aby poszukał jakichkolwiek pęknięć w Twojej jednostce (i nieruchomości jako całości). Powinny one uszczelnić wszelkie dziury lub pęknięcia, aby zapobiec przyszłym inwazjom.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Upewnij się, że okna są odpowiednio uszczelnione\r\n\r\nUszczelnienie okien ma na celu wyeliminowanie wszelkich wejść, które karaluchy mogą mieć do Twojego mieszkania. Ponieważ jednak karaluchy mają zdolność przechodzenia przez bardzo małe otwory, konieczne jest profesjonalne uszczelnienie okien.\r\n\r\n## Końcowe przemyślenia\r\n\r\nKaraluchy są nie tylko uciążliwe, ale mogą również stanowić poważne zagrożenie dla twojego zdrowia. Dlatego ważne jest, aby przez cały czas utrzymywać mieszkanie w czystości i podejmować działania zapobiegawcze, aby znacznie zmniejszyć ryzyko inwazji.\r\n\r\nJeśli jesteś oblegany przez plagę karaluchów, porozmawiaj ze swoim właścicielem lub zarządcą nieruchomości.

Jednak zarazki i bakterie łazienkowe są wszędzie. Należą do nich patogeny jelitowe, wirusy żołądkowo-jelitowe, grzyby i wszystkie rzeczy, o których nigdy więcej nie chcesz myśleć.\r\n\r\nGotowy, aby nauczyć się sprzątać łazienkę? Czas otworzyć okna, wywietrzyć łazienkę i zabrać się do poważnego szorowania.\r\n\r\n-Jak czyścić łazienkę: materiały, których będziesz potrzebować\r\n-Jak często należy czyścić łazienkę?\r\n-13 kroków do czyszczenia łazienki\r\n-Końcowe przemyślenia\r\n\r\n## Jak czyścić łazienkę: materiały, których będziesz potrzebować\r\n\r\n- Gąbki i płuczki\r\n- Ręczniki papierowe lub szmaty\r\n- Worki na śmieci\r\n- Mop\r\n- Środek do czyszczenia fug\r\n- Szczotka do WC i środek do czyszczenia muszli klozetowych\r\n- Tabletki do czyszczenia muszli klozetowej wpuszczane\r\n- Odświeżacz powietrza\r\n\r\nJeśli chcesz, aby Twój dom był sprzątany od góry do dołu, oprócz tych wskazówek spróbuj skorzystać z naszej listy kontrolnej sprzątania domu.\r\n\r\n## Jak często należy czyścić łazienkę?\r\n\r\nZajmowanie się sprzątaniem łazienki również wymaga harmonogramu. Większość obszarów, takich jak prysznic i umywalka, wymaga czyszczenia raz w tygodniu.\r\n\r\nNależy jednak wycierać toaletę, z której korzysta wiele osób co kilka dni lub dłużej. Ustal harmonogram sprzątania ze współlokatorem i wyłącz w razie potrzeby.\r\n\r\nNiech wyrzucanie akcesoriów łazienkowych i niezbędnych rzeczy jest również częścią rutynowego sprzątania. Oto, jak często należy wymieniać podstawowe akcesoria łazienkowe, takie jak zasłony prysznicowe i maty łazienkowe.\r\n\r\n## 13 kroków do czyszczenia łazienki\r\n\r\n#### 1. Szoruj prysznic\r\n\r\nUwielbiasz żele pod prysznic, fantazyjne mydła i produkty do golenia na półkach prysznicowych? Usuń wszystkie przedmioty pod prysznicem, aby dotrzeć do wszystkich powierzchni.\r\n\r\nUżyj zwalczającego pleśń sprayu pod prysznic. Następnie zacznij szorować pleśń, brud i mydło.\r\n\r\nZasłona prysznicowa jest pełna pleśni i pleśni? Jeśli nie możesz go wyszorować, wyrzuć go i kup świeży co kilka miesięcy.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Oczyść ściany\r\n\r\nPłytki i fugi przyciągają pleśń łazienkową z nieestetycznymi czarnymi plamami. Twój środek do czyszczenia łazienki ze środkiem zwalczającym pleśń może pomóc.\r\n\r\nMożesz też wypróbować jedną część wybielacza i dwie części wody. Następnie wcieraj go w płytkę i pozostaw na 30 minut.\r\n\r\nPomiń roztwór wybielacza, jeśli masz w łazience kolorową zaprawę, która może wyblaknąć. Zamiast tego szoruj za pomocą środka do czyszczenia łazienki zwalczającego pleśń i pleśń. Napraw pękniętą, wyblakłą lub uszkodzoną zaprawę.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Wyczyść sufit\r\n\r\nUsuń pajęczyny i wszystko inne pozostające w rogach sufitu. Ostrożnie oczyść czarną foremkę 1/4 szklanki białego octu, dwie szklanki gorącej wody i dwie lub trzy łyżki boraksu. Uważaj, aby roztwór nie dostał się do oczu.\r\n\r\nNależy zgłosić wynajmującemu upartą czarną pleśń, aby uniknąć jej rozprzestrzeniania się i problemów zdrowotnych. Czarna pleśń może powodować problemy z oddychaniem i oddychaniem u Ciebie, Twoich współlokatorów i gości.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Wytrzyj lub przetrzyj podłogę\r\n\r\nChwyć za mop lub Swiffer i zaatakuj swoje podłogi z zemstą. Szoruj rogi, poszukaj pleśni i wrzuć matę łazienkową do pralki. Wytrzyj listwy przypodłogowe i poszukaj wszystkiego, co przegapiłeś.\r\n\r\nPoświęć chwilę, aby zauważyć wszelkie dziury lub uszkodzenia wokół listew przypodłogowych. Szkodniki domowe mogą wykorzystać je jako wejście i rozprzestrzenić się na resztę mieszkania. Zgłoś je wynajmującemu, aby szybko rozwiązać problem.\r\n\r\n#### 5. Wyczyść zlew i toaletkę\r\n\r\nBakterie i brud mogą gromadzić się w umywalce i stwarzać zagrożenie dla zdrowia. Dobrze wyszoruj zlew gąbką, aby uniknąć zarysowania porcelany lub delikatnej powierzchni.\r\n\r\nUżyj środka do czyszczenia łazienki, aby wytrzeć resztę próżności. Wytrzyj wszystkie szuflady i szafki wokół zlewu.\r\n\r\nCo się dzieje nad Twoim zlewem? Wytrzyj lustro i zwróć uwagę na krawędzie.\r\n\r\n#### 6. Wyczyść toaletę\r\n\r\nTo ten moment, którego się bałeś! Zabierz się do pracy, dezynfekując toaletę za pomocą szczotki toaletowej i środka do czyszczenia muszli klozetowych. Pracuj nad wszystkimi częściami, których, jak masz nadzieję, już nigdy nie będziesz musiał dotykać.\r\n\r\nDodaj środek do czyszczenia muszli klozetowych, gdy będzie czysty. Używaj tylko odpowiedniego środka czyszczącego. Unikaj spłukiwania wybielacza lub innych chemikaliów w toalecie.\r\n\r\nWyczyść wszystkie obszary toalety, w tym górną, dolną i zewnętrzną część miski. Zawsze możesz nosić rękawiczki, jeśli ta praca cię obrzydza.\r\n\r\n#### 7. Umyj wszystkie ręczniki kąpielowe i do rąk\r\n\r\nZbierz ręczniki kąpielowe i ręczniki do rąk i wrzuć je do pralki. Dokładnie umyj je i wysusz, jeśli to możliwe, aby zabić zarazki.\r\n\r\nMasz stare ręczniki z dziurami lub innymi uszkodzeniami? Rozważ podarowanie starych ręczników lub wyrzucenie ich i rozpoczęcie od nowa.\r\n\r\n#### 8. Odkurzanie powierzchni i zamiatanie lub odkurzanie podłóg\r\n\r\nŁazienki gromadzą zaskakującą ilość kurzu. Odkurz półki w szafie na bieliznę, szuflady lub inne powierzchnie.\r\n\r\nZamiatanie i odkurzanie łazienek wyłożonych wykładziną. Użyj środka do czyszczenia dywanów, aby usunąć wszelkie plamy lub problematyczne miejsca.\r\n\r\n#### 9. Umyj okna\r\n\r\nWeź trochę płynu do mycia szyb i popracuj nad myciem okien. Aby uzyskać najlepsze rezultaty, użyj środka czyszczącego, który nie pozostawia smug. Wytrzyj kurz i brud z parapetów i ram okiennych.\r\n\r\n#### 10. Zdezynfekuj klamki\r\n\r\nCzy zastanawiałeś się kiedyś, co rośnie na twoich klamkach? Zdezynfekuj je odpowiednim środkiem czyszczącym. Możesz użyć roztworu octu i wody, aby pomóc usunąć zarazki.\r\n\r\n#### 11. Wyrzuć stare lekarstwa\r\n\r\nCo kręci się w twojej apteczce? Powinieneś wyrzucić stare, przeterminowane lekarstwa. Zazwyczaj leki dostępne bez recepty można wrzucić do torebki Ziploc.\r\n\r\nLeki na receptę wymagają bezpiecznej metody usuwania. Odwiedź witrynę Diversion Control Division, aby znaleźć bezpieczny sposób na pozbycie się substancji kontrolowanych.\r\n\r\n#### 12. Wyrzuć śmieci w łazience\r\n\r\nZbierz śmieci w łazience i wyrzuć je. Wyczyść kosz na śmieci w łazience lub wymień go na nowy. Dodaj czysty worek na śmieci stworzony na wypadek rozlania.\r\n\r\nDodaj puszkę do recyklingu, jeśli regularnie wyrzucasz wiele butelek szamponu i innych produktów.\r\n\r\n#### 13. Dezodoryzacja sprayem do łazienki\r\n\r\nJesteś prawie gotowy! Odśwież swoją lśniąco czystą łazienkę za pomocą domowego eliminatora w sprayu. Pozostaw drzwi i okna otwarte przez chwilę, aby zapach i resztki zapachu środka czyszczącego mogły rozprowadzić się w środku.\r\n\r\n## Końcowe przemyślenia\r\n\r\nGratulujemy zdobycia umiejętności sprzątania łazienki! Spraw, aby dokładne szorowanie było regularnym wydarzeniem. I nie wstydź się, jeśli Twoja lśniąca, czysta łazienka jest teraz Twoim ulubionym pomieszczeniem w domu.

INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (62, 9, 'Zbadaj najczęściej i najrzadziej sprzątane przedmioty w Twoim domu.md', '', '﻿![img](/resources/images/images_shutterstock_1042494718-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\nW czasie kryzysu związanego z COVID-19 ważne jest, aby dobrze radzić sobie z czyszczeniem i dezynfekcją w swoim mieszkaniu. Wiem, wiem, wszyscy robimy podstawowe rzeczy: myjemy pościel, wyrzucamy śmieci i szorujemy toaletę. Ale o czym większość ludzi zapomina? Jakie przedmioty w Twoim domu nie były czyszczone od lat i niosą niechciane zarazki?\r\n\r\nLista mieszkań przebadała ponad 500 osób, aby dowiedzieć się, jakie artykuły gospodarstwa domowego są najczęściej pomijane podczas rutynowych sprzątań. Podczas przeglądania wyników ankiety prosimy o zapoznanie się z następującymi informacjami:\r\n\r\n**\'Najczęściej sprzątane\'** = % respondentów, którzy ostatnio czyścili ten przedmiot w ciągu ostatnich kilku miesięcy.\r\n\r\n**„Najmniej sprzątane”** = % respondentów, którzy ostatnio czyścili ten przedmiot kilka lat temu lub nigdy.\r\n\r\n![bathroom vanity](/resources/images/shutterstock_1141261541-1-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Łazienka\r\n\r\nOgólnie rzecz biorąc (i być może na szczęście) respondenci stwierdzili, że łazienka jest najczęściej sprzątanym pokojem w ich domu. Jeśli chodzi o najbardziej czyszczone przedmioty *w* łazience, mata do kąpieli jest na szczycie listy. 89% respondentów wskazało matę do kąpieli jako swój „najczęściej sprzątany” przedmiot (sprzątany w ciągu ostatniego miesiąca lub kilku miesięcy). Za matą do kąpieli znajduje się uchwyt na szczoteczkę do zębów i grzebień do włosów, przy czym odpowiednio 85% i 84% respondentów określiło te przedmioty jako „najbardziej czyszczone”.\r\n\r\nPo drugiej stronie spektrum najmniej sprzątanym elementem w łazience jest waga. W rzeczywistości 28% ludzi nie wyczyściło wagi w ciągu ostatniego roku. Zakładając, że waga jest często używanym przedmiotem dla większości osób, ważne jest, aby dobrze ją wyczyścić.\r\n\r\nJeśli chodzi o powierzchnie „najbardziej dotykane”, klamka do drzwi do łazienki była trzecim „najsłabiej czyszczonym” elementem dla najemców. W rzeczywistości 17% respondentów stwierdziło, że nie czyściło go w ciągu ostatnich kilku lat lub *nigdy*.\r\n\r\nCzyszczenie i dezynfekcja „najczęściej dotykanych” powierzchni, takich jak klamki do drzwi, ma zasadnicze znaczenie dla zapobiegania rozprzestrzenianiu się wirusa COVID-19. Dlatego upewnij się, że dodajesz drzwi do łazienki do swojej zwykłej, a być może, w świetle bieżących wydarzeń, codziennej rutyny sprzątania.\r\n\r\n![img](/resources/images/shutterstock_416796661-1024x609.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Kuchnia\r\n\r\nUdajmy się do kuchni, gdzie płyta kuchenna bierze górę za „najbardziej wyczyszczony” przedmiot. 95% respondentów stwierdziło, że czyściło kuchenkę w ciągu ostatniego miesiąca lub kilka miesięcy temu. Za płytą kuchenną znajdują się gałki kuchenki i uchwyt lodówki, odpowiednio 87% i 85% respondentów, twierdząc, że czyścili te przedmioty w ciągu ostatnich kilku miesięcy *przynajmniej*.\r\n\r\nJeśli chodzi o „najsłabiej czyszczone” przedmioty w kuchni, na szczycie listy znajduje się kostkarka do lodu. 28% ankietowanych twierdzi, że *nigdy* nie czyściło kostkarki do lodu. Lodówka do lodówki to jedna z najbardziej zaraźliwych rzeczy w kuchni, więc upewnij się, że ją posprzątasz. Jeśli nie zostaną odpowiednio wyczyszczone, kostkarki do lodu mogą zostać skażone pleśnią, salmonellą, E. coli i Shigella.\r\n\r\nPamiętajcie o przyjaciołach, tylko dlatego, że jest tam jedyna woda, nie oznacza to, że kostkarka do lodu uniknie zanieczyszczenia! Aby uniknąć zachorowania Ciebie lub Twojej rodziny, pamiętaj o regularnym dokładnym czyszczeniu kostkarki do lodu od wewnątrz i na zewnątrz.\r\n\r\n![Living room](/resources/images/nathan-fertig-FBXuXp57eM0-unsplash-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Salon\r\n\r\nZajrzyjmy do salonu, przestrzeni, w której większość czasu spędzamy na kanapie, spędzając czas z przyjaciółmi i rodziną. Oto dobra wiadomość, „pod kanapami” to najbardziej sprzątany przedmiot w salonie. W rzeczywistości 79% respondentów stwierdziło, że sprzątało pod kanapami w ciągu ostatniego miesiąca lub kilka miesięcy temu.\r\n\r\nNiestety wiele osób zaniedbuje sprzątanie swoich salonów. 26% respondentów nie czyściło ostatnio pilotów do telewizora, fuj! Pilot do telewizora to kolejna „najczęściej dotykana” powierzchnia i wymaga częstego czyszczenia.\r\n\r\nJeśli chodzi o najmniej czyszczony przedmiot, to tylny panel telewizora jest najbardziej zaniedbany. 28% respondentów stwierdziło, że ostatnio lub nigdy nie czyściło tylnego panelu telewizora. Jest to zdecydowanie przeoczone, ale może po cichu zbierać zarazki. Wyczyść to!\r\n\r\n![Bedroom](/resources/images/logan-nolin-EvceCyopkKI-unsplash-1-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Sypialnia\r\n\r\nCała ta rozmowa o sprzątaniu sprawia, że czujesz się trochę śpiący? Zrozumiałe… ale najpierw przyjrzyjmy się procedurom sprzątania naszego ulubionego miejsca: sypialni.\r\n\r\nPościel zajmuje pierwsze miejsce wśród „najczęściej sprzątanych” przedmiotów, a 98% respondentów twierdzi, że czyściło pościel w ciągu ostatniego miesiąca lub kilka miesięcy temu. Jestem pewien, że Twoja druga połówka ucieszy się, gdy to usłyszy!\r\n\r\n„Najmniej sprzątanymi” przedmiotami w sypialni są kosz na pranie i materac – około 30% respondentów (odpowiednio 32% i 30%) twierdzi, że rzadko lub *nigdy* czyści te rzeczy. Możesz zadać sobie pytanie, jak dokładnie czyścisz materac? Ten przewodnik krok po kroku przeprowadzi Cię przez cały proces.\r\n\r\n![img](/resources/images/shutterstock_1256513359-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Przedmioty dla zwierząt\r\n\r\nHau, hau! Nie zapominajmy o naszych futrzastych przyjaciołach. Przedmioty dla zwierząt również wymagają dobrego czyszczenia!\r\n\r\nMiska dla zwierząt jest „najczęściej czyszczonym” przedmiotem, a 90% respondentów twierdzi, że czyściło miskę swojego zwierzaka w ciągu ostatniego miesiąca. Ponieważ miska dla zwierząt to miejsce, w którym Twój zwierzak otrzymuje * większość * posiłków (hej, nie oceniamy tych okazjonalnych resztek po obiedzie), częste sprzątanie jest koniecznością.\r\n\r\nNiestety, okazuje się, że właściciele zwierząt domowych nie są tak pilni, jeśli chodzi o *zabawki dla zwierząt*. 31% respondentów twierdzi, że *nigdy* nie czyściło zabawek dla zwierząt, fuj. Zabawki dla zwierząt są stale w pysku Twojego zwierzaka lub rzucane po całym domu, więc pamiętaj o częstym czyszczeniu, aby zapobiec zachorowaniu Ciebie lub Twojego zwierzaka!\r\n\r\n## Ogólne przedmioty gospodarstwa domowego\r\n\r\nJeśli chodzi o różne artykuły gospodarstwa domowego, wentylator sufitowy jest „najbardziej czyszczonym” przedmiotem. 71% respondentów stwierdziło, że czyści wentylator sufitowy *przynajmniej* raz na kilka miesięcy. Często czyszczone są również włączniki światła i pralki.\r\n\r\nBadanie wykazało, że żarówki są „najsłabiej czyszczonymi” różnymi artykułami gospodarstwa domowego. 35% respondentów stwierdziło, że *nigdy* nie czyści swoich żarówek. Czyszczenie żarówek może wydawać się nużące, ale poprawia żywotność żarówki. W rzeczywistości brudne żarówki świecą o 30% mniej jasno niż czyste. Więc przestań z niepotrzebnymi zamiennikami i przystąp do czyszczenia!\r\n\r\n## Końcowe przemyślenia\r\n\r\nPonieważ wszyscy staramy się jak najlepiej zrozumieć i zwalczać pandemię COVID-19, ważne jest, aby zrobić krok wstecz i przemyśleć nasze codzienne nawyki. Opracowanie dokładnej, częstej procedury czyszczenia i dezynfekcji może pomóc w powstrzymaniu wirusa przed wejściem do twoich drzwi wejściowych.\r\n\r\nMoże zamieniasz sprzątanie w nową zabawę ze współlokatorami, gdy „WFH” (pracuje z domu) lub dziećmi, gdy wracają do domu ze szkoły. Powiedzmy, że pierwszy, który skończy pokój, wybierze dzisiejszy film Netflix lub restaurację na wynos! Słyszeliśmy, że niektóre miejsca serwują nawet napoje dla dorosłych na wynos...\r\n\r\nPrzede wszystkim ważne jest, aby zachować bezpieczeństwo. Ale bawmy się z tym trochę! Miłego sprzątania!\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:27:03', '2021-03-10 20:01:46', '/resources/images/images_shutterstock_1042494718-1024x683.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/cleaning-survey', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (63, 9, 'Wszystko, co powinieneś zdezynfekować w swoim mieszkaniu.md', '', '﻿![img](/resources/images/images_shutterstock_215726422-1024x680.jpg)\r\n\r\nPonieważ koronawirus ogarnia świat, znaczenie dystansu społecznego i dezynfekcji ma kluczowe znaczenie dla powstrzymania jego rozprzestrzeniania się. Ale skąd wiesz, że prawidłowo dezynfekujesz i robisz swoją część, aby powstrzymać nowego koronawirusa?\r\n\r\n-Różnica między czyszczeniem a dezynfekcją\r\n- Produkty dezynfekujące\r\n-Dezynfekcja kuchni\r\n-Dezynfekcja łazienki\r\n-Dezynfekcja telefonu i urządzeń\r\n-Końcowe przemyślenia\r\n\r\n## Różnica między czyszczeniem a dezynfekcją\r\n\r\nJest różnica między sprzątaniem mieszkania a dezynfekcją. TheCDC informuje, że sprzątanie to tylko usuwanie zarazków, brudu i zanieczyszczeń pokrywających usługę.\r\n\r\nCzyszczenie blatów może sprawić, że będą wyglądać lśniąco czysto i zmniejszyć ryzyko rozprzestrzeniania się infekcji. Nie zabija jednak zarazków.\r\n\r\nDezynfekcja wykorzystuje chemikalia do zabijania drobnoustrojów powierzchniowych. Jednak niekoniecznie usuwa brud lub usuwa wirusy. Zamiast tego należy zastosować dezynfekcję po czyszczeniu, aby ograniczyć rozprzestrzenianie się nowego koronawirusa i innych zarazków.\r\n\r\nSprzątanie i dezynfekcja mieszkania w tej chwili ma kluczowe znaczenie dla zachowania zdrowia i powstrzymania rozprzestrzeniania się COVID-19. Badania pokazują, że nowy koronawirus może przetrwać na powierzchniach przez wiele godzin lub dni.\r\n\r\nDobrą wiadomością jest to, że właściwe czyszczenie może pomóc w zapobieganiu COVID-19 i innym wirusom, aby zachować zdrowie.\r\n\r\nRozpocznij misję dezynfekcji, koncentrując się na często dotykanych powierzchniach. To są pożywki dla wirusa.\r\n\r\n## Produkty dezynfekujące\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 jest uważany za wirusa otoczkowego, takiego jak SARS-CV-2. Polega na ochronnej powłoce lipidowej.\r\n\r\nMożesz dezaktywować tę powłokę za pomocą odpowiednich środków czyszczących. Nowy koronawirus jest również łatwiejszy do rozbicia niż wiele wirusów żołądkowo-jelitowych, takich jak norowirus.\r\n\r\nNa szczęście popularne produkty gospodarstwa domowego mogą pomóc w zabiciu COVID-19 i powstrzymaniu jego rozprzestrzeniania się. Na liście znajdują się spraye dezynfekujące, chusteczki i wybielacze, ale z kilkoma zastrzeżeniami. Nie wszystkie chusteczki mogą zabić nowego koronawirusa. Ponadto na półkach sklepów spożywczych brakuje wielu materiałów eksploatacyjnych.\r\n\r\nEPA zawiera listę zatwierdzonych środków dezynfekujących na COVID-19, ale wymaga pewnych odniesień, aby upewnić się, że wymienione są aktywne składniki.\r\n\r\nMożesz również odwołać się do tej listy środków czyszczących, aby pomóc w ustaleniu nowych zabójców koronawirusa, takich jak Clorox Disinfecting Bathroom Cleaner i Lysol Brand Bleach Multi-purpose Cleaner.\r\n\r\n#### Domowe środki dezynfekujące\r\n\r\nCo zrobić, jeśli nie możesz znaleźć żadnego z produktów na półkach? CDC ma rozwiązanie do tworzenia kopii zapasowych, które większość ludzi ma już w domu lub może łatwo znaleźć. Wymieszaj ćwierć szklanki domowego wybielacza chlorowego z jednym galonem zimnej wody. Następnie pozostaw na dwadzieścia lub trzydzieści minut na powierzchni przed wysuszeniem i wytarciem.\r\n\r\nChociaż sztuczka z wybielaniem w trybie gotowości działa dobrze, nie jest odpowiednia dla każdej powierzchni lub pomieszczenia w Twoim mieszkaniu.\r\n\r\nNie przegap żadnego miejsca! Skorzystaj z naszej listy kontrolnej sprzątania, aby zająć się swoim mieszkaniem od góry do dołu.\r\n\r\n![apartment kitchen](/resources/images/shutterstock_1105740260-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Dezynfekcja kuchni\r\n\r\nTwoja kuchnia może być siedliskiem wszelkiego rodzaju zarazków. Oto od czego zacząć dezynfekcję:\r\n\r\n- Blaty\r\n- Wszystko z uchwytami, w tym piekarnik, gałki szafki i zlew\r\n- Deski do krojenia\r\n- Podłogi\r\n- Półki lodówki\r\n\r\nWycieki kuchenne są powszechne, a nie nagłe. Należy je jednak natychmiast posprzątać. W przeciwnym razie wyciek może dalej rozprzestrzeniać wirusy i skazić inne części kuchni.\r\n\r\nTo samo dotyczy twoich potraw. Wyczyść je natychmiast. Następnie sprawdź, czy Twoja zmywarka jest wyposażona w ustawienie odkażania i podgrzewania. Im więcej możesz zabić zarazków, tym lepiej.\r\n\r\nNie wiadomo, co gnije na ręcznikach kuchennych. Jeśli są stare, wymień je, zamykając je w torbie Ziploc i wyrzucając. W przeciwnym razie regularnie myj je na dużym ogniu i dokładnie wysusz.\r\n\r\nPodróż z dezynfekcją nie kończy się wraz z wyrzuceniem ostatniego ręcznika papierowego do kosza na śmieci. Natychmiast wyjmij śmieci i umyj ręce. Następnie wyczyść kosz, włóż do niego nowy worek na śmieci i umyj ręce.\r\n\r\nIm bardziej złagodzisz ryzyko rozprzestrzeniania się zarazków, tym lepiej.\r\n\r\n![bathroom vanity](/resources/images/shutterstock_1141261541-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Dezynfekcja łazienki\r\n\r\nTwoja łazienka to kolejne miejsce do gruntownego czyszczenia i dezynfekcji. Zajmij się zlewem i pamiętaj, aby zdezynfekować armaturę i dokładnie opróżnić. Pamiętaj, aby wyczyścić obszary wokół zlewów, takie jak toaletka, lustro i półki.\r\n\r\nDobrze wyszoruj toaletę. Zwróć szczególną uwagę na miejsce pod siedzeniem, wokół obręczy i uchwytu. Pamiętaj, aby regularnie czyścić uchwyt toalety chusteczką dezynfekującą. Następnie przejdź do:\r\n\r\n- Drzwi prysznicowe i prysznicowe, jeśli je masz\r\n- Wrzuć matę łazienkową i ręczniki do pralki\r\n- Podłogi\r\n- Wyjmij śmieci oraz wyczyść i zdezynfekuj swój kosz\r\n- klamka\r\n\r\n## Dezynfekcja telefonu i urządzeń\r\n\r\nJeśli chodzi o Twoje urządzenia, wybielacz nie jest Twoim przyjacielem. Chusteczki Clorox dobrze sprawdzają się w dezynfekcji telefonu. Apple zaleca używanie chusteczki nasączonej 70-procentowym alkoholem izopropylowym do dezynfekcji iPhone\'a i innych urządzeń.\r\n\r\nZanim zaczniesz, wyłącz telefon i inne urządzenia oraz odłącz je. Usuń swoje nowe etui lub inne pokrycie, aby je również zdezynfekować.\r\n\r\nCelem zawsze jest dokładna praca. Należy jednak uważać, aby nie przedostać się do portów urządzenia czystsze ani zawilgocone. Wyczyść te obszary na sucho gładką ściereczką z mikrofibry, która często jest dołączana do okularów.\r\n\r\n#### Inne rzeczy do dezynfekcji\r\n\r\nKiedy zaczniesz dezynfekować, zdajesz sobie sprawę, ile rzeczy dotykasz przez cały dzień w swoim mieszkaniu. Zrób spis tego, czego dotykasz przez cały dzień, w tym:\r\n\r\n- Pilot do telewizora\r\n- Włączniki światła\r\n- Klamki\r\n- Wszystkie uchwyty meblowe\r\n- Klawiatura, mysz komputerowa i klawisze laptopa\r\n\r\nPamiętaj też o czyszczeniu własnych ubrań, pościeli, narzut i koców. Sprawdź instrukcje pielęgnacji i umieść je w pralce.\r\n\r\nJeśli nie możesz ich samodzielnie umyć, spróbuj zamknąć je w torbie z dala od innych rzeczy. Pomoże Ci to uniknąć rozprzestrzeniania się zarazków i wirusów. Poddanie własnych rzeczy kwarantannie i czekanie na śmierć wirusa przez kilka dni jest lepsze niż nicnierobienie.\r\n\r\nBadania pokazują, że wirusy takie jak COVID-19 są żywe przez 2 lub 3 dni. Jednak każdego dnia wciąż uczymy się o tym czegoś nowego. Najlepiej założyć, że wszystko, co zapieczętujesz, jest prawdopodobnie zainfekowane przez tydzień lub dłużej.\r\n\r\n## Końcowe przemyślenia\r\n\r\nPamiętaj, że wszystkie pandemie się skończyły, a wirusy rzeczywiście umierają. Jednak wszelkiego rodzaju wirusy nadal krążą z przypływami i odpływami, dlatego ważne jest regularne czyszczenie i dezynfekcja. W razie wątpliwości wyczyść, zdezynfekuj i powtórz swoją drogę przez każdy kryzys zdrowotny.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:27:23', '2021-03-10 20:02:37', '/resources/images/images_shutterstock_215726422-1024x680.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/disinfect-your-apartment', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (64, 9, '10 najbardziej zaraźliwych rzeczy w Twojej kuchni, o których (prawdopodobnie) zapomnisz posprzątać.md', '', '﻿![img](/resources/images/images_shutterstock_793913143-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\nJeśli uważasz, że twoje mieszkanie jest już czyste, prawdopodobnie przeoczyłeś kilka rzeczy. Na szczęście Międzynarodowe Badanie Zarazków Gospodarstw Domowych NSF jest tutaj, aby przypomnieć nam, ile nie wyczyściliśmy – i konsekwencje.\r\n\r\nCzy wiesz, że badania pokazują, że ponad 20% epidemii chorób przenoszonych drogą pokarmową wynika z jedzenia spożywanego w domu? Ponadto ukryte zarazki i brud wyglądają obrzydliwie porozrzucane po całej kuchni. Wraz z rozprzestrzenianiem się koronawirusa wydaje się, że teraz jest to idealny czas na rozpoczęcie odkażania.\r\n\r\nPodwiń rękawy i wyjmij środki czystości. Poniżej przedstawiamy 10 najbardziej zaraźliwych rzeczy w Twojej kuchni.\r\n\r\n![kitchen cleaning tools](/resources/images/shutterstock_1154531851-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## 1. Dozownik wody do lodówki\r\n\r\nBadanie NSF mówi, że drożdże i pleśń rozwijają się w obszarach takich jak nasze dystrybutory wody. Widoczne powierzchnie przetrzyj czystą gąbką nasączoną octem i wodą. Możesz również rozpylić miksturę bezpośrednio do dozownika.\r\n\r\nJeśli masz pewność co do tego, co robisz, możesz również rozebrać dozownik wody. Następnie zdezynfekuj go od wewnątrz.\r\n\r\n## 2. Gumowa szpatułka\r\n\r\nNie chcemy ci tego zdradzać, ale E. coli żyje wśród nas. Sięgnij po nieoczekiwane gumowe szpatułki i zabierz się do pracy, dobrze je szorując.\r\n\r\nOpłucz je w gorącej wodzie z kilkoma łyżkami stołowymi chloru na galon wody. W mgnieniu oka sprawdzą się również ocet i woda.\r\n\r\nAle twoje gumowe szpatułki mogą być straconą przyczyną. Jeśli po czyszczeniu nadal są lepkie, wyrzuć je. Syntetyczne lub naturalne materiały są często rozkładane przez gorące oleje z ostatniej imprezy w mieszkaniu.\r\n\r\n![Blender](/resources/images/shutterstock_419869516.jpg)\r\n\r\n## 3. Blender\r\n\r\nMieszanie koktajli i smoothie w blenderze to doskonały sposób na rozpoczęcie weekendu. Ale możesz również dodawać do napojów kilka dodatkowych składników, takich jak E. coli, Salmonella, drożdże i pleśń.\r\n\r\nWyszoruj blender mydłem do naczyń i gorącą wodą. Następnie napełnij gorącą wodą i zmiksuj, aby dostać się do uszczelki.\r\n\r\nJeśli to możliwe, zdejmij uszczelkę z blendera. Następnie rozcieńczyć ocet i wodę w celu dokładnego oczyszczenia.\r\n\r\n## 4. Komora na warzywa w lodówce\r\n\r\nCzy używasz komory na warzywa w lodówce jako pojemnika na kompost? Chociaż kompost można kompostować w mieszkaniu, szuflada na warzywa nie jest miejscem, w którym można go przechowywać. Prawdopodobnie uprawiasz salmonellę, listerię, drożdże i pleśń razem z warzywami.\r\n\r\nTheCDC zaleca wyrzucanie starej żywności i opróżnianie szuflad. Następnie wyszoruj je gorącą wodą z mydłem. Roztwór jednej łyżki stołowej wybielacza w płynie i galon wody może również pomóc w dezynfekcji lodówki.\r\n\r\n## 5. Lodówka Dozownik Lodu\r\n\r\nCzy wiesz, że dystrybutory lodu mogą zaostrzyć twoją alergię? Dozownik lodu jest winowajcą drożdży i pleśni. To może powodować choroby u alergików.\r\n\r\nUsuń i wyrzuć lód. Następnie zabierz się do pracy z czterema filiżankami octu destylowanego i wodą do linii kostkarki do lodu i dozownika.\r\n\r\nPo pięciu lub dziesięciu minutach moczenia spłucz i powtórz. Proces ten może pomóc w rozbiciu drożdży, pleśni i wapna, które budują ukrytą fabrykę zarazków.\r\n\r\n## 6. Lodówka na mięso\r\n\r\nBezmięsne poniedziałki mogą być najzdrowszą nocą w tygodniu. Nieszczelne pojemniki na mięso i zapomniane jedzenie to przepis na E. coli i Salmonellę.\r\n\r\nWyjmij szufladę, wyrzuć stare mięso, wymieszaj roztwór składający się z jednej części octu i dwóch części wody i zabierz się do pracy. Pamiętaj również, aby szorować półki, na których mięso mogło leżeć nawet przez kilka minut.\r\n\r\n![Knife block](/resources/images/shutterstock_733997086-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## 7. Blok noża\r\n\r\nZdobycie pierwszego bloku noża jest oznaką poważnego dorosłości. Jednak może również wywołać chorobę. Pomóc może mydło, woda i łagodny roztwór wybielacza w postaci łyżki wybielacza na każdy galon wody.\r\n\r\nA jeśli szukasz nowego bloku noża, wybierz produkt, który nie zawiera szczelin na drewno. Prawdopodobnie trzymają bakterie i innych niepożądanych gości.\r\n\r\n## 8. Pojemniki do przechowywania żywności\r\n\r\nPrzechowywanie żywności jest kluczem do czystej kuchni. Może sprawić, że poczujemy się, jakbyśmy wygrywali w zorganizowanej grze w lodówkę. Ale te pojemniki do przechowywania żywności z gumowymi uszczelkami blokują również salmonellę, drożdże i pleśń.\r\n\r\nPomóc może roztwór octu i wody, ale mogą być potrzebne nowe pojemniki do przechowywania żywności. Produkty i systemy z certyfikatem NSF mogą pomóc w rozwiązaniu problemów związanych z przechowywaniem żywności.\r\n\r\n## 9. Otwieracz do puszek\r\n\r\nPrzyjrzyj się bliżej otwieraczowi do puszek, zanim otworzysz następną puszkę fasoli. Drobne cząsteczki jedzenia mogą zostać wciągnięte w ostrze. To zamienia twój otwieracz do puszek w fabrykę zarazków.\r\n\r\nRęczne otwieracze do puszek można szorować szczoteczką do zębów i detergentem do mycia naczyń, aby oczyścić rowki. Jeśli to możliwe, wyjmij ostrze z elektrycznego otwieracza do puszek. Następnie użyj szczoteczki do zębów zamoczonej w occie, aby usunąć pozostałości.\r\n\r\nPamiętaj, aby wysuszyć otwieracz do puszek, aby zapobiec rdzewieniu. Uważaj również, aby nie skaleczyć się ostrzami.\r\n\r\n## 10. Uszczelka izolująca lodówkę\r\n\r\nW Twojej uszczelce izolacyjnej lodówki odbywa się impreza z zarazkami. E. coli, salmonella, drożdże i listeria mogą zalegać wokół uszczelki izolacyjnej lodówki.\r\n\r\nCzęsto zapomniana uszczelka izolująca lodówkę wymaga nieco kreatywności w czyszczeniu. Wymieszaj pół łyżeczki płynu do mycia naczyń w filiżance ciepłej wody. Następnie wyszoruj szmatką lub miękką szczoteczką do zębów.\r\n\r\nTraktuj pleśń na uszczelce roztworem wybielacza chlorowego i ciepłej wody.\r\n\r\nNiezależnie od tego, czy jesteś zainspirowany, czy całkowicie zdegustowany, nadszedł czas, aby wyczyścić te zapomniane, najbardziej zaraźliwe rzeczy w Twojej kuchni. Twoje miejsce nigdy nie będzie tak czyste. Będziesz mieć dobry sen, wiedząc, że jesteś wolny od zarazków.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:28:14', '2021-03-10 20:03:14', '/resources/images/images_shutterstock_793913143-1024x683.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/germiest-things-in-kitchen', 0, 0);

Oto kilka wskazówek do rozważenia.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Koordynuj z właścicielem lub sąsiadami\r\n\r\nWiele organizacji nie wymaga, abyś był w domu. Jednak może się to różnić w zależności od lokalizacji i rozmiaru przedmiotu.\r\n\r\nWażne jest, aby zapytać właściciela lokalu, czy wolno Ci zostawić jakiekolwiek przedmioty poza Twoim kompleksem mieszkalnym. Dzieje się tak zwłaszcza wtedy, gdy mieszkasz w dużym budynku.\r\n\r\nSą szanse, że po odbiór mebli będziesz musiał być w domu. Możesz jednak koordynować współpracę z sąsiadami, jeśli nie jesteś dostępny.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Przekaż wysokiej jakości meble\r\n\r\nPodarowane meble zazwyczaj muszą być w przyzwoitym stanie. Musi być wolny od plam, rozdarć i innych uszkodzeń. Dobrze jest poinformować organizację charytatywną o stanie darowizny mebli, zanim przyjdą. W ten sposób możesz upewnić się, że jest to akceptowalne.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Odpisz darowiznę na meble\r\n\r\nMożesz odpisać darowiznę na meble od swoich podatków. Zapytaj organizację charytatywną o paragon podatkowy lub inne dokumenty do wykorzystania na czas podatkowy. Pomoże ci to zatrzymać więcej pieniędzy w kieszeni.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Rozdawaj rzeczy za darmo\r\n\r\nNadal nie możesz znaleźć organizacji charytatywnej, która przyjmie darowiznę mebli? Wypróbuj witrynę typu Freecycle.\r\n\r\nTa oddolna organizacja non-profit pomaga ludziom oddawać swoje rzeczy za darmo, aby pomóc w kierowaniu towarów wielokrotnego użytku z wysypisk śmieci. Freecycle to także fantastyczny sposób na uporządkowanie mieszkania i rozdanie rzeczy, których organizacje charytatywne zwykle nie biorą. Obejmuje to przedmioty od kompostu do skrawków tkanin.\r\n\r\n#### 5. Przekaż dalej\r\n\r\nKiedy zaplanujesz odbiór mebli, wszyscy wygrywają. Wisienką na torcie jest to, że w Twoim mieszkaniu będzie schludnie i bez bałaganu!\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:28:48', '2021-03-10 20:03:52', '/resources/images/images_shutterstock_297528134-1024x683.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/free-furniture-donation-pick-up', 0, 0);

Ta charakterystyczna czarna pleśń w łazience nieuchronnie wita nas wszystkich. Kuszące jest, aby to zignorować i mieć nadzieję, że zniknie. Jednak najlepszą linią obrony przed czarną pleśnią w łazience jest jej czyszczenie i próba jej zapobiegania.\r\n\r\nGotowy zakasać rękawy i pozbyć się pleśni w łazience? Oto, co warto wiedzieć.\r\n\r\n-Jak rośnie pleśń łazienkowa?\r\n-Jak rozpoznać pleśń w łazienkach?\r\n-Jak stwierdzić, czy to czarna pleśń czy pleśń?\r\n-Jak czyścić pleśń łazienkową\r\n-Niebezpieczeństwa czarnej pleśni\r\n\r\n## Jak rośnie pleśń w łazience?\r\n\r\nŁazienki są doskonałą pożywką dla rozwoju pleśni. W łazience łatwo jest uwięzić wilgoć i kręcić się po gorącym prysznicu. Niewielka przestrzeń i brak wentylacji w łazience mogą również powodować pojawianie się i utrzymywanie pleśni w łazience.\r\n\r\nNieszczelne toalety, umywalki i materiały celulozowe, takie jak tapety, mogą również sprzyjać rozwojowi pleśni w łazienkach. Czasami możesz zrobić wszystko, co możliwe i nadal znaleźć w łazience czarną pleśń, która nie zniknie.\r\n\r\n## Jak rozpoznać pleśń w łazienkach\r\n\r\nCzarna pleśń w łazience nie zawsze jest łatwa do zauważenia. Sprawdź pod:\r\n\r\n- Twoja próżność zlewu\r\n- Wokół toalety\r\n- Drzwi prysznicowe\r\n- Wentylator wentylacyjny\r\n\r\nŁatwo też przeoczyć pleśń na suficie łazienki. Wejdź na drabinę i zajrzyj za żaluzje i zasłony. Sprawdź także swoje oprawy oświetleniowe.\r\n\r\nPomalowanie pleśni na suficie w łazience może być kuszące. Jednak czarna pleśń jest uparta. Prawdopodobnie odrośnie lub przerośnie przez twoją farbę.\r\n\r\n## Jak stwierdzić, czy to czarna pleśń czy pleśń\r\n\r\nLudzie często mylą pleśń z czarną pleśnią w łazience. Istnieją jednak pewne kluczowe różnice.\r\n\r\nPleśń jest zwykle biała, szara lub żółta. Jest miękki i pudrowy w dotyku.\r\n\r\nTymczasem czarna pleśń w łazience jest często zielona lub czarna. Zaczyna rosnąć pod wilgotnymi powierzchniami i może wyglądać na rozmytą.\r\n\r\nMoże się również okazać, że pleśń łazienkowa jest śliska w dotyku. To szybko cię obrzydzi.\r\n\r\nCzarna pleśń i pleśń są brzydkie. Możesz wyczyścić jeden w ten sam sposób. Jednak pleśń w łazience jest często bardziej problematyczna. Może powodować problemy zdrowotne.\r\n\r\n## Jak czyścić pleśń łazienkową\r\n\r\nIstnieje kilka różnych sposobów czyszczenia pleśni w łazience. Ważne jest, aby usunąć czarną pleśń i wyczyścić łazienkę. Musisz jednak podejść do tego poprawnie. W przeciwnym razie możesz zniszczyć swoje ściany.\r\n\r\nZanim zaczniesz, zrób kilka zdjęć problemu. Pamiętaj o zrobieniu kilku zdjęć pleśni na suficie. W ten sposób możesz łatwo monitorować czarną pleśń i mieć dokumentację dla właściciela.\r\n\r\n#### Czyszczenie pleśni z płytek ściennych\r\n\r\nOtwórz okna, włącz wentylator i załóż maskę na twarz. Czas wydobyć wybielacz.\r\n\r\nDodaj jedną część wybielacza i dwie części wody. Następnie wyszoruj wszystkie wyłożone kafelkami ściany, które nie mają kolorowej fugi. Możesz spowodować blaknięcie pigmentu fugi.\r\n\r\nUżyj twardego pędzla, aby nanieść roztwór wybielacza na płytkę. Następnie po 30 minutach dokładnie spłucz.\r\n\r\nMożesz pominąć wybielacz i zdecydować się na środek do czyszczenia łazienki ze środkiem do usuwania pleśni i pleśni. Tylko nie spłukuj wybielacza w toalecie. To może spowodować niebezpieczną reakcję chemiczną.\r\n\r\nWybielacz może wytwarzać przytłaczający zapach i być trudny do zarządzania. Zamiast tego możesz również użyć jednoczęściowego octu, dwuczęściowego roztworu wodnego.\r\n\r\nSpryskaj to bezpośrednio na formę. Następnie pozostaw na 30 minut przed szorowaniem twardą szczotką.\r\n\r\n#### Czyszczenie pleśni z tapety lub pomalowanych ścian\r\n\r\nAtak na tapetę i pomalowane ściany lub sufity wybielaczem może zniszczyć Twoje powierzchnie. Zamiast tego wymieszaj rozwiązanie, które obejmuje:\r\n\r\n- 1/4 szklanki białego octu\r\n- dwie filiżanki gorącej wody\r\n- dwie lub trzy łyżki boraksu\r\n\r\nSpryskaj czarną pleśń. Następnie pozostaw na 10 do 20 minut przed wyszorowaniem i wytarciem do sucha.\r\n\r\nJeśli denerwujesz się, że tapeta jest zbyt wilgotna, powinieneś ją osuszać co około 10 minut.\r\n\r\n## Niebezpieczeństwa związane z czarną pleśnią\r\n\r\nWięc o co chodzi z czarną pleśnią? Czarna pleśń to coś więcej niż tylko nieszkodliwy wygląd.\r\n\r\nW rzeczywistości może pogorszyć twoje zdrowie i samopoczucie. Wdychanie lub dotykanie czarnej pleśni może:\r\n\r\n- Stwórz reakcję alergiczną\r\n- U niektórych osób wywołać atak astmy\r\n- Powoduje duszność\r\n- Narażaj niemowlęta, dzieci, osoby starsze oraz osoby z osłabionym układem odpornościowym i chorobami płuc na większe ryzyko\r\n- Czarna pleśń w łazience zamienia się w Stachybotrys Chartarum, który jest wysoce toksyczny i wymaga usunięcia przez profesjonalistę\r\n\r\nNiektórzy ludzie mogą nie odczuwać reakcji z powodu czarnej pleśni. Może jednak narazić każdego, kto wejdzie do Twojego mieszkania, na ryzyko dla zdrowia.\r\n\r\nUsunięcie i odpowiednie czyszczenie z czarnej pleśni może pomóc w zmniejszeniu powikłań. Może również sprawić, że Twoja łazienka będzie wyglądać czyściej.\r\n\r\n#### Pleśń w łazienkach: czy to odpowiedzialność wynajmującego?\r\n\r\nWielu najemców uważa, że ​​ich właściciele powinni radzić sobie z czarną pleśnią lub są do tego prawnie zobowiązani. Obecnie nie ma żadnych przepisów federalnych, które określają, że właściciel musi radzić sobie z czarną pleśnią.\r\n\r\nNiektóre stany i miasta mają przepisy dotyczące pleśni. Aby dowiedzieć się więcej, skontaktuj się ze swoim stanowym wydziałem ochrony środowiska i stanowym wydziałem zdrowia publicznego.\r\n\r\nIstnieje również szara strefa dotycząca odpowiedzialności właściciela za pleśń. Właściciel jest zobowiązany do zapewnienia bezpiecznego i nadającego się do mieszkania mieszkania. W rezultacie możesz przekonać ich do rozwiązania problemu.\r\n\r\nSprawdź warunki najmu, aby sprawdzić, czy odnosi się konkretnie do pleśni lub pleśni. Dobrą praktyką jest również zapętlenie właściciela lokalu w kwestii czarnej pleśni.\r\n\r\nWłaściciel może Cię zaskoczyć i zgłosić chęć niezwłocznego usunięcia. Niezbędne jest również udokumentowanie częstotliwości występowania pleśni. W ten sposób właściciel może monitorować sytuację.\r\n\r\nDzięki proaktywnemu podejściu możesz wyeliminować pleśń w łazience, zanim wymknie się spod kontroli. Oczyść, monitoruj, komunikuj się z właścicielem i powtarzaj!\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:29:14', '2021-03-10 20:04:24', '/resources/images/images_shutterstock_532074880-1024x683.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/bathroom-mold', 0, 0);

Czas zająć się listą kontrolną sprzątania domu, aby uczcić wiosnę! Przy odrobinie organizacji i odpowiednim podejściu Twoje mieszkanie będzie lśniło czystością w mgnieniu oka.\r\n\r\nOto najlepsza lista kontrolna wiosennych porządków, która pomoże Ci zacząć.\r\n\r\n- Lista kontrolna sprzątania domu Pro Porady\r\n-Salon\r\n-Kuchnia\r\n-Łazienka\r\n-Sypialnia\r\n-Biuro domowe lub dodatkowy pokój\r\n- Korytarze\r\n-Pralnia\r\n-Sprawdź swój dom\r\n\r\n## Lista kontrolna sprzątania domu Pro Porady\r\n\r\nRozpocznij swoją listę kontrolną wiosennych porządków od kilku profesjonalnych wskazówek. Na początek upewnij się, że twój środek czyszczący jest bezpieczny w użyciu.\r\n\r\nTo, co działa na oknach, prawdopodobnie nie jest odpowiednie dla stali nierdzewnej. Może zrujnować inne powierzchnie.\r\n\r\nPoszukaj uniwersalnych środków czyszczących, które sprawdzą się w pudłach dla wszystkich powierzchni Twojego mieszkania, od blatów ze stali nierdzewnej po granitowe blaty.\r\n\r\nWszelkie agresywne chemikalia, takie jak wybielacze, powinny być używane oszczędnie i tylko w dobrze wentylowanych miejscach. Niebezpieczne jest również spłukiwanie niektórych środków czyszczących, takich jak wybielacz, w toalecie.\r\n\r\nZachowaj ostrożność podczas używania gąbek i innych materiałów, aby uniknąć zanieczyszczenia krzyżowego. Przypadkowe użycie tej samej gąbki kuchennej i łazienkowej podczas wiosennego sprzątania może złamać układ.\r\n\r\nZachowaj swoje podłogi na koniec. W przeciwnym razie prawdopodobnie będziesz musiał ponownie odkurzyć lub wytrzeć po odkurzeniu i oczyszczeniu.\r\n\r\n## Salon\r\n\r\nNiezależnie od tego, czy masz współlokatora, czy bawisz się w salonie solo, przed obejrzeniem kolejnego wielkiego meczu zaznacz wszystko na liście kontrolnej sprzątania domu.\r\n\r\n**Potrzebne materiały eksploatacyjne:**\r\n\r\n- Szmaty i środek do czyszczenia wszystkich powierzchni\r\n- Odkurz lub mop\r\n- Odkurzacz\r\n- Ręczniki papierowe i płyn do mycia szyb\r\n- Środek do czyszczenia dywanów lub tkanin\r\n- Środek do czyszczenia podłóg, mop lub odkurzacz\r\n- Domowy eliminator zapachów w sprayu\r\n- Worki na śmieci\r\n\r\n**Lista kontrolna sprzątania salonu:**\r\n\r\n- Stoliki kawowe i stoliki końcowe\r\n- Osłona przeciwpyłowa lub różne powierzchnie\r\n- Wytrzyj ekran i powierzchnie telewizora\r\n- Czyszczenie okien\r\n- Odśwież meble ręcznym lub małym odkurzaczem\r\n- Zdezynfekuj klamki\r\n- Dezodoryzuj za pomocą domowego eliminatora w sprayu\r\n- Wyrzuć śmieci z salonu\r\n- Zamiataj i czyść podłogi\r\n- Wytrzyj listwy przypodłogowe\r\n\r\n## Kuchnia\r\n\r\nKiedy ostatnio dobrze wyszorowałeś swoją kuchnię?

Aby Ci to ułatwić, stworzyliśmy listę przydatnych przedmiotów.\r\n\r\nJeśli nie czujesz się komfortowo, używając detergentów zawierających dużo chemikaliów, wybierz naturalne rozwiązania, takie jak soda oczyszczona, ocet, olejek z drzewa herbacianego i sok z cytryny.

Ok, to nie nauka, ale zdrowy rozsądek, aby wyrzucić szczotkę do toalety, gdy jest zbyt obrzydliwa, by trzymać ją w mieszkaniu. Powinieneś go wyrzucić po ataku żołądka lub jeśli minęło sześć miesięcy.\r\n\r\n**Zasłona prysznicowa** - Para, szumowiny mydlane i post-party funk mogą sprawić, że zasłona prysznicowa będzie wyglądać na brudną i brudną. Dodaj podkład do prysznica i szoruj go co kilka miesięcy. Wrzucaj tkaninową zasłonę prysznicową do prania co trzy lub cztery miesiące.\r\n\r\n**Słuchawki prysznicowe i filtry** – Czy zastanawiałeś się kiedyś, ile brudu wystrzeliwuje z twoich głowic prysznicowych? Jeśli teraz nerwowo poklepujesz się po głowie, nie jesteś sam. Prawdopodobnie będziesz musiał wymieniać wkład głowicy prysznicowej co sześć miesięcy do roku. To zależy od produkcji i tego, jak często bierzesz prysznic.\r\n\r\n**Mata łazienkowa lub dywanik** — może to być szokiem, ale elementy łazienkowe, takie jak maty, musisz wymieniać tylko raz na rok lub dwa. To zależy od tego, jak dobrze je wyczyścisz. Pierz go raz w tygodniu ręcznikami, chyba że ty i twoja współlokatorka macie brudne stopy.\r\n\r\n**Gąbki łazienkowe** – Gąbki kuchenne, które zbierają zarazki, są prawdopodobnie bardziej brudne niż toaleta. Tymczasem sprzątanie łazienki raz na jakiś czas nie jest powodem do niepokoju, by wyrzucić wszystkie gąbki. Rzuć te gąbki łazienkowe raz na trzy miesiące, chyba że zachowujesz dziwaczne nawyki łazienkowe.\r\n\r\n**Wanna** – Czy wiesz, że od czasu do czasu musisz wymieniać wannę? Jeśli Twoja wanna wygląda, jakby pochodziła ze złomowiska, zapytaj właściciela, czy była wymieniana w ciągu ostatnich 10 do 15 lat. Jeśli minęło już dziesięć lat lub więcej, nadszedł czas.\r\n\r\n**Bateria do wagi łazienkowej** – Czy zauważyłeś, że wszyscy trzymają wagę w łazience, abyśmy mogli zrzucić dodatkowe uncje wraz z dodatkowymi ubraniami? Jeśli waga nie działa, spróbuj wymienić baterie. Zasada jest taka, że co trzy lata w przypadku baterii alkalicznych lub 10 lat w przypadku litowych.\r\n\r\n![towels, loofah and brush](/resources/images/shutterstock_1569849529-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Przedmioty higieny osobistej\r\n\r\nDorosłość polega na przyznaniu, że nie możemy już wycierać rąk w spodnie i używaniu maty do kąpieli zamiast śledzenia wody w naszym mieszkaniu. Oto, co należy wymienić, aby utrzymać w ryzach swoje nawyki higieny osobistej.\r\n\r\n**Ręczniki do rąk** - Czy kreatywnie obracasz przedmioty łazienkowe, takie jak ręczniki, na pasku, aby nikt nie zauważył, że są trwale poplamione, postrzępione i podarte? Czas je zmienić. W przeciwnym razie wymieniaj je co dwa lata. Myj je co kilka dni, aby powstrzymać zarazki.\r\n\r\n**Ręczniki kąpielowe** - Okazuje się, że powinniśmy wymieniać ręczniki, zanim będą tak wytarte, że przypominają papier toaletowy. Spróbuj wymieniać artykuły łazienkowe, takie jak ręczniki, co dwa do trzech lat. To znaczy, chyba że są wyjątkowo cienkie lub obskurne. W takim przypadku uaktualnij się do statusu ręcznika dla gości i wysusz się w luksusie.\r\n\r\n**Loofah -** Znasz tę bajeczną loofah, która sprawiła, że ​​poczułeś się jak w Ulubionych rzeczach Oprah? Cóż, jeśli to było dłużej niż miesiąc temu, musisz to wymienić. Pleśń jest również łamaczem umów w dowolnym momencie, zwłaszcza jeśli jesteś Oprah.\r\n\r\n**Szczoteczka do zębów** – postępuj zgodnie z zaleceniami Amerykańskiego Towarzystwa Stomatologicznego (ADA). Rzucaj szczoteczką do zębów co trzy do czterech miesięcy lub wcześniej, jeśli włosie jest postrzępione. Zalecamy również wyrzucenie każdej szczoteczki do zębów, co do której podejrzewasz, że współlokatorka błędnie użyła po późnej nocy spędzonej w pubie.\r\n\r\n**Ostrza do golenia** — Nie ma sztywnych i szybkich zasad dotyczących wyrzucania żyletek. Uważaj na nacięcia skóry, ciągnięcie lub nagromadzenie dużej ilości mazi. Pudełko z subskrypcją ulubionych ostrzy może również pomóc Ci zapamiętać i sprawić, że Twoja skóra będzie cudownie wyglądać.\r\n\r\n**Szczotki i grzebienie** – Łatwo zignorować bałagan związany ze szczotką lub grzebieniem, gdy jest wsunięty do szuflady z innymi przedmiotami łazienkowymi. Czyść narzędzia do włosów raz w tygodniu lub wcześniej, jeśli twoje włosy są długie lub pełne produktów. W przeciwnym razie wyrzucaj te szczotki do włosów i grzebienie mniej więcej co sześć miesięcy.\r\n\r\n**Pokrowiec na soczewki kontaktowe** - Zdrowie Twoich oczu zależy od tego, gdzie przechowujesz soczewki kontaktowe. Etui na soczewki kontaktowe mogą wyglądać na trwałe. Jednak American Optometric Association zaleca ich wymianę w ciągu trzech miesięcy.\r\n\r\n**Ubrania** - Ubrania mogą trwać w nieskończoność. Nie musisz więc ich wymieniać, dopóki nie będziesz gotowy lub potrzebujesz wymówki, aby na nowo wymyślić swoją garderobę. O ile nie założyłeś bluzy tylko do szybkiego załatwienia sprawy, najlepiej prać ubrania po każdym praniu. A kogo oszukujemy, te staniki będą prane tylko co trzy lub cztery użycia. Ogólnie jest to w porządku, jeśli nie pracujesz nad noworocznym poceniem się.\r\n\r\n![skincare products](/resources/images/shutterstock_556892884-1024x685.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Produkty do pielęgnacji skóry\r\n\r\nWygląda na to, że ludzie całkiem nieźle sobie radzą z inwestowaniem w pielęgnację skóry. Jednak wielu jest mniej sumiennych, jeśli chodzi o wyrzucanie tych płynów i kremów, które są starsze niż nasz ostatni związek. Oto, jak podejść do rutyny „odrzucania pielęgnacji skóry”.\r\n\r\n**Płukanie twarzy** – Czy środki do czyszczenia twarzy tracą ważność, gdy są przeznaczone do… cóż, czyszczenia? Czas wyrzucić środek do demakijażu, jeśli nagle dziwnie pachnie. Nadszedł również czas, aby go wyrzucić, jeśli ma teraz inny kolor lub teksturę niż w momencie zakupu lub wydaje się *wyłączony*.\r\n\r\n**Mydło** – to dobra wiadomość dla zbieraczy, którzy uwielbiają trzymać te wymyślne kostki mydła. Wykorzystaj je teraz. Dobrze osuszona kostka mydła starcza na około miesiąc, zanim zacznie się psuć i stać się śliska. To może sprawić, że Twoje elementy łazienkowe będą wyglądać obrzydliwie przez skojarzenie.\r\n\r\n**Szampon** - Czy zdobyłeś mieszkanie z dużą ilością miejsca na pościel? Można go zaopatrzyć w szampon i pozostawić w nienaruszonym stanie na kilka lat. Jednak po otwarciu należy go wyrzucić w ciągu 18 miesięcy.\r\n\r\n**Kremy** - Kremy nie tylko wspaniale czują się na naszej skórze. Te butelki i słoiki sprawiają, że nasza łazienka wygląda jak spa. Zamiast trzymać te przedmioty łazienkowe w nieskończoność, wyrzuć je w ciągu roku. Być może będziesz musiał je wcześniej wyrzucić, jeśli Twoja skóra zacznie swędzieć. Możesz także zdusić te pokusy, wiedząc, że te otwarte słoiki mogą rozmnażać bakterie i przenosić się na twoją twarz.\r\n\r\n![Makeup brushes](/resources/images/jamie-street-aMuq-Xz7R_M-unsplash-1024x663.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Makijaż\r\n\r\nWszyscy chcemy wyglądać jak najlepiej spacerując po okolicy lub skacząc po barach po mieście. Jednak eksperci twierdzą, że nadal musimy wyrzucić ten makijaż, zanim wywoła u nas nieprzyjemną wysypkę lub infekcję bakteryjną.\r\n\r\n**Tusz do rzęs** - Uwielbiasz pompować nieistniejące rzęsy tuszem do rzęs? Wymieniaj tusz do rzęs co trzy miesiące, aby uniknąć czerwonych oczu i infekcji bakteryjnych.\r\n\r\n**Eyeliner** - Tusz do rzęs i eyeliner zwykle idą w parze. Powinny również trafić do kosza na śmieci wraz z innymi przedmiotami łazienkowymi. Wyrzucaj ten eyeliner co trzy miesiące. Pomoże to zachować zdrowy i świeży wygląd oczu.\r\n\r\n**Podkład** - Podkład nadaje skórze równomierny, promienny wygląd. Możesz używać tej samej butelki przez około rok. Wyrzuć go wcześniej, jeśli konsystencja się zmieni lub nagle zauważysz nieprzyjemną reakcję skórną.\r\n\r\n**Szminka** - Martwisz się, że będziemy nalegać, abyś wyrzuciła swoją super specjalną szminkę? Możesz go przechowywać przez około rok od pierwszego użycia. Możesz to jednak nieco rozciągnąć, jeśli konsystencja i kolor nadal się utrzymują.\r\n\r\n**Róże** - Odmień swoją pozbawioną słońca, zimową twarz odrobiną różu przez okres do dwóch lat od pierwszego użycia. Następnie rzuć i znajdź coś innego, co rozjaśni te policzki.\r\n\r\n**Cienie do powiek** – Podobnie jak róże, cienie do powiek zwykle utrzymują się w łazience przez około dwa lata po pierwszym użyciu. Możesz chcieć wyrzucić je wcześniej, jeśli używasz tego samego starego pędzla do makijażu lub wbijasz palce, aby wydobyć te ostatnie drobinki pudru.\r\n\r\n**Pędzle do makijażu** – Pędzle do makijażu mogą zachować nieskazitelny wygląd twarzy, ale wymagają trochę pielęgnacji. Utrzymuj je, czyść je, a następnie wyrzucaj je mniej więcej co trzy miesiące z innymi przedmiotami łazienkowymi.\r\n\r\n![Medicine cabinet](/resources/images/shutterstock_371789245-1024x683.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Leki i zaopatrzenie\r\n\r\nPrzysięgnijmy sobie, że nie będziemy dorosłymi, którzy trzymają w pobliżu syrop na kaszel, który ma pięć lub sześć lat na wypadek sytuacji kryzysowej. Oto, co zrobić z tymi starymi lekami i zapasami.\r\n\r\n**Leki** – w przeciwieństwie do paczki chipsów, którą prawdopodobnie nadal możesz zjeść po upływie daty ważności, musisz natychmiast wyrzucić przeterminowane leki. Możesz zaryzykować rzucenie kilku tabletek, których skład się zmienił i jest teraz za mocny lub za słaby. Wtedy możesz nie rozumieć, jak to wpływa na twoje ciało. Po prostu powiedz nie.\r\n\r\n**Apteczka** – Pamiętasz, jak czułeś się dorosły po otrzymaniu apteczki? Teraz możesz co kilka miesięcy dorosnąć, sprawdzając, co znajduje się w tym zestawie. Upewnij się, że środki przeciwbólowe są nadal aktualne, materiały eksploatacyjne są w dobrym stanie, a baterie latarek nadal działają.\r\n\r\n## Trzy słowa rady\r\n\r\nJeśli masz wątpliwości co do artykułów łazienkowych, nasza rada brzmi: „**wyrzuć, wymień i powtórz”. Jeśli nie dla siebie, zrób to dla współlokatora, który musi żyć z ręcznikami do rąk, których nie wymieniałeś od ukończenia studiów Szkoła Wyższa.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:30:45', '2021-03-10 20:06:49', '/resources/images/images_oval-mirror-near-toilet-bowl-1910472-1024x683.jpg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/when-to-replace-bathroom-essentials', 0, 0);

Tak, masz innego człowieka, za którego jesteś teraz odpowiedzialny, inną osobę mieszkającą w twoim domu, dziecko do kochania i opiekowania się nim. Jednak jako świeżo upieczony rodzic być może nie zastanawiałeś się zbyt długo nad tym, jak zmienić dom, aby był bezpieczny dla malucha, lub jak upewnić się, że szafa ze środkami czystości nie będzie stanowić zagrożenia dla Twojego dziecka. Pomyśl o wszystkich chemikaliach, które zawiera każda z tych butelek, chusteczek i sprayów. O o! Nagle Twój dom zamienił się w laboratorium naukowe. Tak więc, aby Twoje dziecko nie stało się częścią eksperymentu naukowego, stworzyliśmy przewodnik dotyczący wszystkich rzeczy związanych ze sprzątaniem, jeśli chodzi o dzieci w domu.\r\n\r\n#### **Zdrowie i środki czystości dla dzieci**\r\n\r\nWiększość środków czyszczących zawiera wiele chemikaliów, z których wiele jest powodem do niepokoju, ponieważ mogą powodować problemy zdrowotne we wczesnym dzieciństwie. Niektóre z najczęstszych powikłań mogą obejmować podrażnienie skóry i oczu, astmę, nadwrażliwość na alergeny, oparzenia chemiczne, a nawet zatrucia.\r\n\r\nDobrym sposobem, aby zapobiec wystąpieniu przez dziecko któregokolwiek z wymienionych powyżej problemów zdrowotnych, jest unikanie:\r\n\r\n- Wchodzenie w kontakt z niedawno czyszczonymi przedmiotami gospodarstwa domowego\r\n- Wdychanie chemikaliów wydzielanych przez środki czystości lub niedawno czyszczone przedmioty\r\n- Przypadkowe połknięcie lub rozlanie środków czyszczących\r\n\r\nNa szczęście możesz również unikać określonych chemikaliów w środkach czyszczących, aby zminimalizować niebezpieczeństwo, jakie stanowią dla zdrowia i bezpieczeństwa Twojego dziecka. Pamiętaj, że te chemikalia mogą zagrozić zdrowiu Twojego dziecka, więc uważaj na tych facetów i produkty, w których zwykle się znajdują:\r\n\r\n- LZO (farba, żywica)\r\n- Wybielacz (chusteczki Clorox)\r\n- Triclosan (niektóre pasty do zębów, płyny do mycia ciała itp.)\r\n- Parabeny (niektóre szampony, płyny do mycia ciała itp.)\r\n- ftalany (detergenty, opakowania do żywności itp.)\r\n- etery glikolowe (farby i środki czyszczące)\r\n- Rozpuszczalniki naftowe (farby)\r\n- laurylosiarczan sodu (środki czyszczące i kosmetyki)\r\n\r\n#### **Wskazówki dotyczące sprzątania w sposób bezpieczny dla dzieci**\r\n\r\nSamo posiadanie w domu środków czyszczących zawierających potencjalne alergeny nie stanie się automatycznie problemem. Jeśli jednak butelki z mydłem do naczyń lub torebki z detergentem do czyszczenia nie są prawidłowo przechowywane, mogą powodować problemy. Oto kilka wskazówek, o których należy pamiętać podczas sprzątania, aby zapewnić, że Twój lśniąco czysty dom pozostanie bezpieczny dla Twojego dziecka:\r\n\r\n1. **Czapki z zabezpieczeniem przed dziećmi:** Pamiętaj, aby kupować produkty z **czapkami z zabezpieczeniem przed dziećmi**, aby maluch nie mógł eksperymentować z tym ślicznym niebieskim płynem, którego mama używa do prania.\r\n2. Stwórz bardzo wyraźne oddzielenie żywności od środków czyszczących:\r\n   1. Trzymaj żywność i wszystkie środki czystości oddzielnie i daleko od siebie.\r\n   2. Nie przechowuj środków czyszczących w starych naczyniach lub innych pojemnikach na żywność. Może to potencjalnie prowadzić do zamieszania.\r\n   3. Te ciekawskie palce malucha, pozostawione bez opieki nawet przez sekundę, mogą sięgnąć po mydło, które wygląda jak liść klonu i pachnie jak syrop klonowy i ugryzą bardzo niezdrowy kęs.\r\n3. **Nie używaj trucizn na gryzonie i owady:** Trucizna jest bardzo niebezpieczna, zarówno dla szkodników, jak i dla Twojego dziecka. Nawet pułapki na mrówki ukryte w rogach domu mogą stać się problemem. Gdy Twoje dziecko raczkuje, wszystko w jego zasięgu staje się punktem eksploracji. Upewnij się, że obszar, który badają, jest wolny od szkód i trzymaj wszystkie szkodliwe chemikalia z dala od ich zasięgu.\r\n4. **Utwórz strefę bezpieczeństwa:** Gdy Twoje dziecko dorośnie, możesz chcieć uczyć je o obowiązkach domowych. Być może zainteresuje się pomaganiem w sprzątaniu w domu. Kiedy tak się stanie, stwórz szafkę z zapasami, z której dziecko może korzystać. Upewnij się, że wyklucza wszystko, co zawiera silne składniki chemiczne, które mogą powodować alergie lub inne ciężkie reakcje. Może na razie wystarczy tylko czysty, kolorowy mop i spryskiwacz do wody.\r\n5. **Trzymaj zmywarkę zamkniętą:** Ostre przedmioty to bardzo częste przedmioty w zmywarce. Noże, widelce, delikatne kubki z porcelany to wszystko, czego nie chcesz, aby Twoje dziecko trzymało się bez opieki podczas sprzątania. Zamknąć zmywarkę, aby uniknąć ręcznych talerzy zrobionych z twoich ulubionych talerzy.\r\n6. **Rozcieńcz swoje środki czyszczące:** Wiele środków czyszczących jest tak silnych, że ich rozcieńczenie nie odbierze niczego z ich czystości. Zmniejszy to dotkliwość zawartych w nich składników chemicznych. Dodatkowy punkt: Twoje środki czyszczące wytrzymają dłużej. Należy jednak sprawdzić produkt pod kątem wskazówek dotyczących rozcieńczania.\r\n7. **Wentylacja:** Po sprzątaniu zawsze wywietrz pomieszczenia lub przedmioty, które były sprzątane. Zmniejszy to ilość chemikaliów wdychanych przez dziecko i umożliwi szybsze wyschnięcie przedmiotu. Dotknięcie blatu, który właśnie przetarłeś chusteczkami Clorox, również stanie się bezpieczniejsze.\r\n\r\n#### ** Środki czyszczące bezpieczne dla dzieci, które możesz znaleźć w swojej szafce**\r\n\r\nZanim zagłębimy się w produkty kupione w sklepie, które mogą być dobrym odpowiednikiem bardziej agresywnych chemikaliów, istnieje wiele przedmiotów, które prawdopodobnie masz już w swojej szafce, które są świetne (i bezpieczne) do czyszczenia. Ocet, sok z cytryny i sodę oczyszczoną można mieszać w różnych ilościach i kombinacjach, aby stworzyć bezpieczne dla dzieci środki czyszczące. Wymieszaj trochę octu i wody, aby odkurzyć półki lub spróbuj użyć sody oczyszczonej do czyszczenia piekarnika. Aby uzyskać naturalny odświeżacz powietrza, wymieszaj dwie łyżki tymianku i jedną pokrojoną w plasterki limonkę i rozpyl mieszankę w całym domu.\r\n\r\n#### **Dostępne na rynku artykuły do czyszczenia dla dzieci**\r\n\r\nIstnieje wiele naturalnych i niskochemicznych środków czyszczących, które można znaleźć w lokalnym sklepie spożywczym. Te artykuły są bezpieczniejsze dla twoich najmłodszych i minimalizują ryzyko, o którym wspomnieliśmy powyżej. Poniżej znajduje się kilka sugestii dotyczących bezpiecznych dla dzieci środków czyszczących:\r\n\r\n- **Detergent do prania:** Spróbuj użyć proszku Molly\'s Suds All Natural Laundry Powder lub GreenShield Organic Laundry Detergent zamiast zwykłych, bardziej nasyconych chemicznie odpowiedników. Żadna z tych opcji nie zawiera agresywnych chemikaliów, które świetnie nadają się do prania odzieży dziecięcej.\r\n- **Uniwersalny środek czyszczący:** Dzięki zaledwie sześciu składnikom, Puracy Natural Multi-Surface Cleaner wykonuje swoje zadanie, nie narażając ani dziecka ani Ciebie.\r\n- **Mydła do naczyń i zmywarek:** Dbaj o bezpieczeństwo żywności dzięki bezsiarczanowemu płynowi do naczyń Better Life i pakietom detergentów do zmywarek siódmej generacji. Oba są skuteczne w usuwaniu tłuszczu, a jednocześnie są przyjazne dla rodziny. Jako bonus są bezzapachowe.\r\n- **Mydło do rąk:** Utrzymuj ręce dziecka w czystości, unikając podrażnień skóry dzięki mydłu w płynie Dr. Bronner’s Pure-Castille – Baby, w wersji bezzapachowej.\r\n- **Ściereczki do kurzu:** Wytrzyj półki chusteczkami do czyszczenia octu Cioci Fannie, aby uniknąć używania ciężkich roztworów chemicznych.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:31:26', '2021-03-10 20:06:49', '/resources/images/images_photo-1554344462-4d4ef7ecabc1-1024x683.jpeg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/baby-proof-cleaning', 0, 0);

Nie, to nie jest dobra niespodzianka. To pleśń. Śmierdząca, niebezpieczna pleśń. Co więc zrobić, jeśli znalazłeś pleśń w swoim mieszkaniu? Nie martw się, mamy cię. Postępuj zgodnie z tymi wskazówkami, jak radzić sobie z pleśnią.\r\n\r\n### Co zrobić, jeśli znajdziesz pleśń w swoim mieszkaniu?\r\n\r\n#### 1. Poinformuj właściciela\r\n\r\nJeśli masz podejrzenia, że ​​w Twoim mieszkaniu jest pleśń lub znalazłeś i jest to rażąco oczywiste, nie czekaj z informacją o tym wynajmujący. W ich najlepszym interesie, a także w Twoim, jest jak najszybsze pozbycie się go.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Rób zdjęcia\r\n\r\nZrób zdjęcia formy przed jej usunięciem. W przypadku, gdy właściciel nie spieszy się z tym, aby się tym zająć lub w ogóle nie podejmuje żadnych działań (więcej o tym później) będziesz potrzebować dowodu na obecność pleśni.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Odwiedź lekarza\r\n\r\nMożesz pomyśleć, że masz alergie. Jeśli ciągle kichasz, kaszlesz, doświadczasz bólów głowy, a nawet krwotoków z nosa, przyczyną może być pleśń. Nie wahaj się umówić na wizytę u lekarza i poddać się badaniu.\r\n\r\n#### 4. Uruchom testy\r\n\r\nAby upewnić się, że pleśń została prawidłowo usunięta, najpierw musisz określić, jaki rodzaj pleśni znalazł się w twoim domu - tak, są różne odmiany. Ty lub Twój wynajmujący, w zależności od umowy, powinniście zaplanować test sprawdzający jakość powietrza w pomieszczeniu. Po określeniu rodzaju pleśni można podjąć kroki w celu jej usunięcia.\r\n\r\n### Co się stanie, jeśli właściciel nie podejmie działań?\r\n\r\n#### 1. Zapytaj prawnika\r\n\r\nTwój stan może nie wymagać, abyś miał prawnika, ale pomocne może być uzyskanie opinii specjalisty na temat najlepszych opcji i sposobu postępowania w przypadku, gdy właściciel nie podejmie działań w celu usunięcia pleśni. Pamiętaj, że pleśń jest szkodliwa dla twojego zdrowia i chcesz, aby jak najszybciej zniknęła. Być może będziesz musiał złożyć pozew, a sąd będzie mógł nakazać naprawę.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Przechowuj dokumentację\r\n\r\nPamiętaj, aby zachować kopie pisemnych kontaktów z wynajmującym, zdjęcia pleśni i wszelkie rachunki dotyczące problemu. Na przykład zachowaj wyniki testu jakości powietrza w pomieszczeniu.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Wyjdź\r\n\r\nJeśli problem nie zostanie rozwiązany, prawdopodobnie najlepiej będzie się wyprowadzić, zwłaszcza jeśli właściciel nie odpowiada. To prawdopodobnie dobry znak, że zakwaterowanie nie jest dla Ciebie bezpieczne.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:32:12', '2021-03-10 20:07:22', '/resources/images/images_Screen-Shot-2019-03-22-at-5.14.46-PM.jpeg', 'https://www.apartmentlist.com/renter-life/baby-proof-cleaning', 0, 0);

Jeśli jesteś nowy w magicznym rozwiązaniu domowego bałaganu od Marie Kondo, zdecydowanie zalecamy zapoznanie się z naszym poprzednim artykułem dotyczącym jego podstaw. Możesz także przeczytać bestsellerową książkę Marie „Zmieniająca życie magia sprzątania: japońska sztuka porządkowania i organizowania”. Chociaż metoda jest dość prosta, wymaga dużo organizacji i planowania. Aby pomóc Ci w pełni wykorzystać to, stworzyliśmy bardzo szczegółową listę kontrolną KonMari do wydrukowania, którą można znaleźć na dole tego artykułu. Zanim wyruszysz w tę podróż do życia bez bałaganu, upewnij się, że znasz główne zasady i postępuj zgodnie z poniższymi krokami:\r\n\r\n**Krok 1.** Zaangażuj się w posprzątanie wszystkiego na raz, dokładnie przechodząc przez cały proces i kończąc go.\r\n\r\n**Krok 2.** Uporządkuj w kolejności:\r\n\r\n- Ubranie\r\n- Książki\r\n- Papiery\r\n- Komono - rzeczy nieujęte w poprzednich kategoriach, które nie mają wartości sentymentalnej\r\n- Pamiątki lub przedmioty sentymentalne\r\n\r\n**Krok 3**. Podziel kategorie na podkategorie, aby uzyskać lepszą widoczność. Możesz skorzystać z naszej listy kontrolnej. Jest kompleksowy i powinien obejmować większość przedmiotów znalezionych w przeciętnym gospodarstwie domowym.\r\n\r\n**Krok 4**. Zbierz wszystkie przedmioty z tej samej kategorii i podkategorii w jednym miejscu.\r\n\r\n**Krok 4.** Podnieś/dotknij każdego elementu, aby określić, czy „rozbudza w tobie radość”, czy też poprawia samopoczucie.\r\n\r\n**Krok 5.** Odrzuć przed zorganizowaniem. Podziękuj za każdy przedmiot, zanim go wyrzucisz.\r\n\r\n**Krok 6.** Przechowuj przedmioty w pionie, jeśli to możliwe.

INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (73, 9, 'Sprzątanie z Marie Kondo 6 wskazówek do wdrożenia w 2019 r..md', '', '﻿![img](/resources/images/images_IMG_1359.jpg)\r\n\r\nJest styczeń - czas nowych początków, noworocznych postanowień i zatłoczonych siłowni. Jeśli nie wiesz, jak poprawić swoje życie w 2019 roku, nie martw się… mamy dla Ciebie artykuł! Krótko mówiąc, w tym roku w końcu sprzątasz swoje mieszkanie i porządkujesz swoje życie!\r\n\r\nJeśli przeprowadziłeś jakiekolwiek badania dotyczące usuwania zanieczyszczeń, istnieje szansa, że ​​natknąłeś się na metodę KonMari. Po raz pierwszy pojawiła się w bestsellerowej książce New York Timesa „Zmieniająca życie magia sprzątania”. Teraz te same metody są prezentowane w nowym programie Netflix „Sprzątanie z Marie Kondo”. Metoda sugeruje, aby zachować tylko rzeczy, które „rozbudzają radość”, aby Twoje życie było szczęśliwsze, a Twój dom schludniejszy. Aby przybliżyć Ci metodę Kondo, zebraliśmy 5 pomocnych wskazówek, które możesz zacząć wdrażać już dziś.\r\n\r\n### 1. Postępuj zgodnie z właściwą kolejnością podczas porządkowania mieszkania.\r\n\r\n„Winging it” może być zabawne i ekscytujące w pewnych sytuacjach, ale nie, jeśli chodzi o sprzątanie domu. Posiadanie planu jest niezbędne, aby stworzyć schludny dom, w którym wszystko ma swoje miejsce. Według Kondo istnieje optymalna kolejność, której należy przestrzegać podczas organizowania swoich rzeczy:\r\n\r\n1. Ubrania\r\n2. Książki\r\n3. Dokumenty\r\n4. Komono - inne artykuły gospodarstwa domowego; różne przypadkowe przedmioty zaśmiecające Twoje płaskie powierzchnie i szuflady.\r\n5. Przedmioty sentymentalne - trofea, pocztówki, listy i te sukienki druhen, których już nigdy nie założysz.\r\n\r\nJak widać, sentymentalne przedmioty są zapisywane na koniec, ponieważ znacznie trudniej się z nimi rozstać. Dla wygody spróbuj utworzyć podkategorie w ramach wymienionych powyżej. Ułatwi to organizowanie i „czyszczenie”.\r\n\r\n### 2. Organizuj według kategorii, a nie pomieszczeń.\r\n\r\nWiększość ludzi sprząta pokój po pokoju, przenosząc się z jednego miejsca do drugiego. Choć może się to wydawać wygodne, może przynieść efekt przeciwny do zamierzonego. Stacjonarne to dobry przykład rzeczy, które mają tendencję do rozkładania się po domu – tu długopis, tam ołówek. Jeśli zorganizujesz pokój według pokoju, w przeciwieństwie do kategorii, nie zobaczysz pełnego obrazu swojego ekwipunku – czego masz pod dostatkiem i czego faktycznie potrzebujesz. Potrzebujesz pomocy przy kategoryzowaniu artykułów gospodarstwa domowego? Sprawdź naszą bardzo szczegółową listę kontrolną KonMari do wydrukowania!\r\n\r\n### 3. Zatrzymaj układanie.\r\n\r\nJest to jedna z głównych zasad metody KonMari. Według Marie układanie rzeczy w stosy jest pod wieloma względami szkodliwe. Na przykład ludzie zapominają o przedmiotach, które lądują na dnie stosu. Dodatkowo, układając rzeczy jeden na drugim, łatwo jest iść w nieskończoność, nie zauważając, ile zgromadziłeś. Wydaje się dość oczywiste, że łatwiej znaleźć książkę na półce niż w stosie, ale często zapominamy, że tę samą zasadę można zastosować do innych rzeczy, takich jak ubrania czy artykuły papiernicze.\r\n\r\n### 4. Ułóż ubrania pionowo i według kolorów.\r\n\r\nPomyśl o swojej szafie i stosie koszul gdzieś na półce lub w dolnej szufladzie. Łatwo zapomnieć o ubraniach na dole stosu, zwłaszcza jeśli wierzchnie są większe. Nawet jeśli je pamiętasz, prawdopodobnie są pomarszczone pod ciężarem ubrań na wierzchu. Aby rozwiązać ten problem, Marie Kondo zaleca dzielenie ubrań na kategorie, składanie ich i przechowywanie w pionie, jeśli to możliwe, dla lepszej widoczności. Trzymaj ubrania tego samego koloru razem, układając je od najciemniejszego do najjaśniejszego, odpowiednio od lewej do prawej, tworząc gradient. Wieszaj tylko ubrania, które trzeba powiesić – te wykonane z miękkich przewiewnych materiałów, dopasowane fasony i łatwo gnijące się ubrania, których nie należy składać. Podczas wieszania tych przedmiotów staraj się ułożyć je w taki sposób, aby unosiły się w prawo. Dłuższe, cięższe przedmioty powinny pozostać po lewej stronie, krótsze i lżejsze po prawej, tworząc coś w rodzaju trójkąta. Ma to wiele zalet. Lepiej zrozumiesz swoją garderobę, co masz, czego potrzebujesz i czego możesz się pozbyć. Marie ma serię filmów na temat prawidłowego składania różnych przedmiotów, aby zachować ich świeżość, brak zagnieceń i możliwość przechowywania w pionie.\r\n\r\n### 5. Trzymaj cały papier w jednym miejscu.\r\n\r\nPodstawową zasadą dotyczącą papieru nakreśloną w książce Marie Kondo jest wyrzucenie wszystkiego. Cóż, prawie wszystko.

Po latach eksperymentów Marie Kondo wymyśliła prostą, ale genialną metodę przechowywania toreb. Znacznie zmniejszy to miejsce potrzebne do ich przechowywania i ułatwi znalezienie torebki, którą chciałbyś nosić dzisiaj. Wystarczy włożyć w siebie worki tego samego typu! W ten sposób wszystkie Twoje sprzęgła będą w jednym miejscu i łatwe do znalezienia. Upewnij się, że wszystkie paski i uchwyty są widoczne na zewnątrz. Ta metoda nie tylko oszczędza miejsce, ale także uczy świetnego nawyku opróżniania torebki, gdy jej nie używasz.\r\n\r\nOrganizacja domu to nauka, a konsultanci organizacyjni są tam nie bez powodu. Wierzymy jednak, że jeśli poświęcisz trochę czasu i włożysz trochę wysiłku w realizację powyższych zasad, Twój dom w mgnieniu oka stanie się schludniejszy.

Wiele osób zastanawia się: czy jest bezpiecznie wychodzić?\r\n\r\nChociaż niektóre firmy są otwarte, a ograniczenia dotyczące niektórych czynności zostały zniesione, nadal ważne jest, aby podczas podejmowania tej ważnej decyzji wziąć pod uwagę swoją konkretną sytuację zdrowotną.\r\n\r\nIstnieje wiele czynności, których ludziom nie wolno było wykonywać w stanie Maryland na początku pandemii. Obecnie wiele z tych firm i działań jest otwartych. Niektóre działania, w których możesz wziąć udział, obejmują:\r\n\r\n-Wychodzenie do restauracji lub baru?\r\n-Strzyżenie\r\n- Robienie paznokci\r\n- Iść na filmy\r\n- Chodzenie do centrów handlowych\r\n-Zajęcia na świeżym powietrzu, takie jak zwiedzanie parków publicznych lub łowienie ryb\r\n\r\nW tej chwili pytanie nie powinno brzmieć „Czy można bezpiecznie wychodzić?” Zamiast tego powinieneś zadać sobie pytanie, czy *ty * możesz bezpiecznie wykonać określoną czynność lub odwiedzić określone miejsce.\r\n\r\n## Wyjście podczas pandemii koronawirusa\r\n\r\nW tej chwili podjęcie decyzji, czy można bezpiecznie wyjść, może być trudne. Według Centrów Kontroli i Zapobiegania Chorobom (CDC), oto pytania wysokiego poziomu, które powinieneś sobie zadać przed wyjściem:\r\n\r\n- Czy koronawirus rozprzestrzenia się w Twojej społeczności?\r\n- Czy potencjalnie będziesz mieć bliski kontakt z osobą chorą?\r\n- Czy potencjalnie będziesz mieć bliski kontakt z osobami, które nie noszą maski na twarz?\r\n- Czy masz lub mieszkasz z kimś, kto cierpi na schorzenie, które może zwiększać ryzyko ciężkiej choroby?\r\n- Czy podejmujesz codzienne środki zapobiegające koronawirusowi?\r\n\r\nNawet jeśli odpowiesz na wszystkie te pytania i ustalisz, że możesz być w stanie wyjść, istnieją inne czynniki, które powinieneś wziąć pod uwagę.\r\n\r\n### Liczba ludzi\r\n\r\nIm więcej osób wchodzisz w interakcję, tym większe ryzyko zarażenia wirusem. Dystans społeczny jest obecnie jednym z najlepszych narzędzi, jakie mamy do zapobiegania temu wirusowi.\r\n\r\nOsoby, które czują się chore lub obawiają się, że mogą mieć wirusa, powinny pozostać w domu, aby uniknąć zarażenia innych, ale nawet jeśli ktoś nie wygląda na chorego lub nie wykazuje objawów koronawirusa, może być bezobjawowym nosicielem choroby i zarażać innych.\r\n\r\n### Zdolność do fizycznego dystansu\r\n\r\nJeśli wychodzisz, powinieneś być w stanie pozostać co najmniej sześć stóp od ludzi, którzy z tobą nie mieszkają. Im bliżej jesteś innych ludzi, tym większe ryzyko zarażenia wirusem.\r\n\r\nNoszenie maski może pomóc zmniejszyć ryzyko rozprzestrzeniania się koronawirusa, gdy nie możesz utrzymać zalecanego dystansu sześciu stóp.\r\n\r\n### Długość czasu\r\n\r\nJeśli aktywność, w której bierzesz udział lub miejsce, do którego się wybierasz, wymaga dłuższego czasu w bliskim kontakcie z innymi, wtedy ryzyko zarażenia wirusem będzie większe.\r\n\r\nJeśli jesteś bezobjawowym nosicielem wirusa, długotrwały kontakt z innymi osobami może również narazić ich na ryzyko zarażenia wirusem. Noszenie maski może pomóc zmniejszyć to ryzyko, ale im dłużej jesteś w bliskim kontakcie z innymi, tym większa szansa, że ​​Ty lub ktoś inny zdejmie maskę lub zsunie się z twarzy.\r\n\r\n## Wskazówki dotyczące koronawirusa: bezpieczne wyjście\r\n\r\nJeśli weźmiesz pod uwagę wszystkie te czynniki i zdecydujesz, że wychodzenie z domu jest bezpieczne, nadal musisz podjąć pewne podstawowe środki zapobiegawcze, aby zapewnić sobie bezpieczeństwo.\r\n\r\n### Przećwicz podstawowe środki zapobiegawcze\r\n\r\nKiedy jesteś poza domem, kontynuuj stosowanie środków zapobiegawczych, o których wiemy, że chronią nas przed koronawirusem. To zawiera:\r\n\r\n- Przebywanie w odległości co najmniej sześciu stóp od innych\r\n- Noszenie maski\r\n-Częste mycie rąk\r\n-Unikaj dotykania twarzy\r\n- Ćwiczenie właściwej etykiety kaszlu\r\n- Monitorowanie stanu zdrowia przed wyjściem z domu\r\n\r\n### Miej zestaw\r\n\r\nJeśli zdecydujesz się wyjść, ważne jest, aby mieć pod ręką kilka niezbędnych rzeczy, aby zapobiec zakażeniu koronawirusem i odpowiednio zdezynfekować siebie i przedmioty wymagające dużego dotyku. Powinno to obejmować:\r\n\r\n- Maska na twarz\r\n- Środek do dezynfekcji rąk zawierający co najmniej 60 procent alkoholu\r\n- Chusteczki, których można użyć do zakrycia ust, gdy kichasz lub kaszlesz oraz gdy musisz zetknąć się z powierzchniami o wysokim dotyku, takimi jak klamki\r\n\r\n### Zostań na zewnątrz\r\n\r\nWiele miejsc zamkniętych jest obecnie otwartych dla publiczności w ograniczonym zakresie. Jednak CDC obecnie zaleca przebywanie na zewnątrz, gdy jest to możliwe, zwłaszcza jeśli masz zamiar przebywać w bliskiej odległości od innych ludzi.\r\n\r\nMiejsca na zewnątrz zwykle zapewniają wystarczająco dużo miejsca, aby pozostać sześć lub więcej stóp od innych. Jeśli musisz być w pomieszczeniu, poszukaj miejsca z dodatkową wentylacją powietrza, na przykład z otwartym oknem.\r\n\r\n### Poszukaj barier\r\n\r\nBariery między ludźmi — takie jak ekrany z pleksi, oznaczenia podłóg i zmodyfikowane układy — mogą pomóc w ograniczeniu rozprzestrzeniania się koronawirusa.

Dbanie o zdrowie oznacza rozwiązywanie problemów zdrowotnych w miarę ich pojawiania się.\r\n\r\nObejmuje to ocenę przez lekarza podstawowej opieki zdrowotnej i udanie się na pogotowie (ER) w razie potrzeby.\r\n\r\n## Czy powinienem iść do szpitala?\r\n\r\nPobyt w domu, kiedy to możliwe, jest ważnym elementem powstrzymywania rozprzestrzeniania się koronawirusa. Jednak osoby w nagłych wypadkach medycznych lub wymagające pilnej pomocy medycznej nie powinny pozostawać w domu. Jeśli potrzebujesz opieki, powinieneś udać się do szpitala.\r\n\r\nTeraz bardziej niż kiedykolwiek ER są tutaj dla społeczności w Maryland i całym kraju. Szpitale w Systemie Medycznym Uniwersytetu Maryland (UMMS) nigdy nie zamkną naszych drzwi przed nikim, kto potrzebuje opieki.\r\n\r\nProszę, nie ignoruj ​​swojego ciała. Oznaki i objawy ostrzegawcze należy omówić z lekarzem lub ocenić na oddziale ratunkowym lub na izbie przyjęć, w zależności od nasilenia objawów.\r\n\r\n## Kiedy jechać na ER\r\n\r\nUdaj się do szpitala, jeśli wystąpią objawy *jakichkolwiek *zagrażających życiu chorób, a nie tylko objawy koronawirusa.\r\n\r\n### Objawy nagłego wypadku medycznego\r\n\r\nObjawy, które mogą wskazywać na stan zagrożenia życia to:\r\n\r\n- Trudności w oddychaniu, duszność\r\n- Ból lub ucisk w klatce piersiowej lub górnej części brzucha\r\n- omdlenia, nagłe zawroty głowy lub osłabienie\r\n- Zmiany w wizji\r\n- Zamieszanie lub zmiany stanu psychicznego\r\n- Każdy nagły lub silny ból\r\n- Niekontrolowane krwawienie\r\n- Ciężkie lub uporczywe wymioty lub biegunka\r\n- kaszel lub wymioty krwią\r\n- Trudności w mówieniu\r\n\r\nUzyskiwanie pilnej pomocy w razie potrzeby jest szczególnie ważne w przypadku udarów i zawałów serca.

Czasami, gdy opóźnisz opiekę, mogą wystąpić nieodwracalne szkody. Na przykład rany, które nie są odpowiednio pielęgnowane, ulegają zakażeniu lub wymagają bardziej rozległych procedur niż w innym przypadku.\r\n\r\nChociaż ważne jest, aby zachować dystans w miarę możliwości, nadal możesz udać się do gabinetu lekarskiego na niektóre regularnie zaplanowane badania zdrowotne. Na przykład ważne jest, aby uczęszczać na egzaminy, podczas których dziecko będzie otrzymywać rutynowe szczepienia, aby chronić je przed innymi wirusami i bakteriami w społeczności.\r\n\r\nW zależności od sytuacji, Twój lekarz podstawowej opieki zdrowotnej może zapewnić Ci osobistą wizytę lub ocenę telezdrowia.

Zadzwoń do swojego lekarza, aby dowiedzieć się więcej o najlepszych opcjach dla Twoich potrzeb zdrowotnych.\r\n\r\n## Chodzenie do szpitala na koronawirusa\r\n\r\nWiększość osób z koronawirusem doświadcza łagodnych objawów, które można leczyć w domu. Jednak niektórzy ludzie, szczególnie ci, którzy mają podstawowe schorzenia, mogą doświadczać poważniejszych objawów, które wymagają leczenia w szpitalu.\r\n\r\nPoważne objawy koronawirusa, które mogą wymagać pomocy w nagłych wypadkach, obejmują:\r\n\r\n- Problemy z oddychaniem\r\n- Uporczywy ból lub ucisk w klatce piersiowej\r\n- Nowe zamieszanie lub nie można się obudzić\r\n- Usta lub twarz stają się niebieskie\r\n\r\nJeśli masz pytania dotyczące objawów, zadzwoń do swojego lekarza lub porozmawiaj z dyplomowaną pielęgniarką za pośrednictwem linii telefonicznej pielęgniarki UMMS.\r\n\r\nJeśli objawy zagrażają życiu, zadzwoń pod numer 911 lub natychmiast udaj się na pogotowie ratunkowe.\r\n\r\n## Bezpieczeństwo w szpitalu podczas koronawirusa\r\n\r\nSzpitale w całym kraju stoją w obliczu wyzwań związanych z pandemią. Mimo to szpitale są nadal bezpiecznymi miejscami opieki.\r\n\r\nIstnieje wiele środków, które szpitale University of Maryland Medical System podejmują, aby zapewnić Ci bezpieczeństwo.

Jednakże, gdy kupujesz coś za pośrednictwem naszych linków detalicznych, możemy otrzymać prowizję partnerską.\r\n\r\nByć może nie miałeś wcześniej powodu, aby zastanawiać się, jak usunąć żelowy lakier do paznokci, ale jeśli obecnie unikasz swojego salonu i zamiast tego wybierasz DIY paznokcie, ważne jest, aby nauczyć się, jak to zrobić prawidłowo. Uwaga, spoiler: Samo zrywanie manicure żelowego nie jest dobrym pomysłem. Gołym okiem może się wydawać, że wszystko jest w porządku, ale w rzeczywistości usuwasz delikatne warstwy płytki paznokcia (twardą część paznokcia, która wyrasta), gdy odrywasz w ten sposób swoje żelowe paznokcie i może to potencjalnie spowodować trwałe uszkodzenie.\r\n\r\nAby uniknąć skręcania paznokci, zapytaliśmy znaną manikiurzystkę Patricię Yankee, jak usunąć żelowy lakier do paznokci w domu. Jej profesjonalna rada, aby zadbać o zdrowie Twoich paznokci, to powrót do salonu w celu prawidłowego usunięcia, gdy jest to bezpieczne. Ale jeśli nie możesz lub nie chcesz odbyć tej podróży teraz, istnieje kilka łatwych do wykonania kroków, aby uzyskać podobne wyniki w domu.\r\n\r\n## Krok 1: Chroń swoje skórki.\r\n\r\nAceton — którego będziesz potrzebować do usunięcia żeli — może siać spustoszenie na skórze wokół paznokci, więc musisz chronić swoje ubogie skórki. „Zanim się namoczysz, zabezpiecz okolice olejkiem do skórek” – wyjaśnia Yankee. Nie musisz kupować wymyślnego specjalnego olejku do skórek, chyba że chcesz. Wypróbowanym i prawdziwym szybkim lekarstwem domowym jest wazelina (3 USD, Amazon). Wazelina stworzy barierę minimalizującą uszkodzenia acetonu. Aquaphor (10 USD, Amazon) też działa.\r\n\r\n## Krok 2: Poluzuj wierzchnią warstwę grubym pilnikiem do paznokci.\r\n\r\nŻelowy topcoat to twarda, prawie nieprzepuszczalna warstwa, która utrwala kolor na miejscu – dlatego manicure żelowy może trwać tygodniami, a nie dniami. Zadrapanie powierzchni grubym pilnikiem do paznokci pomoże acetonowi wniknąć bez problemu. „Podczas piłowania stosuj lekki i równoległy nacisk”, mówi Yankee, co pomoże ci uniknąć zarysowania płytki paznokcia pod spodem.\r\n\r\n## Krok 3: Namocz paznokcie w acetonie za pomocą wacików i folii aluminiowej.\r\n\r\nAceton (5 USD, Ulta) jest silniejszy i skuteczniejszy niż zmywacz do paznokci bez acetonu, dzięki czemu jest dokładnie tym, czego potrzebujesz, aby usunąć żelowy lakier do paznokci. Nasącz bawełniane waciki, a następnie przytrzymaj je na paznokciach, owijając każdy palec folią aluminiową. Według Yankee, to pułapki ciepła, aby przyspieszyć rozkład żelu. Formuły lakierów hybrydowych różnią się siłą, więc czas oczekiwania może wynosić od 10 do 20 minut. Jeśli nie zrobisz tego dokładnie dobrze, zawsze możesz zapakować i dalej moczyć.\r\n\r\nPorada eksperta Yankee: „Czasami najlepiej jest robić jedną rękę na raz w domu. Lubię zaczynać od dominującej ręki, aby usunąć najtrudniejszą część z drogi. Więc jeśli jesteś leworęcznym, zacznij moczyć paznokcie lewej ręki, a wtedy twoja prawa ręka będzie bryza. „To niewielka zmiana, ale robi ogromną różnicę” – mówi.\r\n## Krok 4: Delikatnie zeskrob warstwy i ponownie namocz, jeśli to konieczne.\r\n\r\nGdy dasz acetonowi czas na działanie magii, chwyć pilnik (lub drewniany pomarańczowy patyczek) i kontynuuj delikatnie zeskrobać warstwy, aby bezpiecznie usunąć lakier żelowy z paznokcia. Jeśli namoczysz się wystarczająco długo, kilka pierwszych warstw zacznie się łatwo odklejać.\r\n\r\nJeśli napotkasz bardziej odporne warstwy, będziesz musiał je poluzować za pomocą kolejnego nasączenia acetonem. Powtarzaj metodę namaczania i skrobania, aż bezpiecznie usuniesz cały kolor, w tym warstwę bazową.\r\n\r\n## Krok 5: Zmyj i nawilż.\r\n\r\n„Po zakończeniu moczenia w acetonie chcesz się upewnić, że dokładnie się umyjesz” – mówi Yankee. Sugeruje też nałożenie kolejnej warstwy oliwki do skórek. Jeśli tym razem chcesz być trochę bardziej fantazyjny niż wazelina, wypróbuj wysoko oceniany ulubiony olejek do skórek Maccibelle (7 USD, Amazon), który ma trzy różne zapachy: mleko i miód, granat i lawenda z drzewa herbacianego.\r\n\r\nYankee sugeruje również utrzymanie nawyku przez kilka dni „tylko po to, aby uzupełnić wilgoć w paznokciach”, ponieważ aceton może być tak ostry.\r\n\r\n## Bonus: kilka produktów, które następnym razem ułatwią Ci życie.\r\n\r\nProces usuwania lakieru żelowego nie jest najtrudniejszą rzeczą na świecie, ale hej, czasami chcesz jeszcze bardziej usprawnić całą tę mękę. Dostępne są zestawy zawierające wszystko, czego potrzebujesz do zdejmowania żeli, a także przydatne produkty do rozwiązywania problemów z niektórymi bardziej irytującymi etapami procesu.

Kiedy spojrzałem na palec, zobaczyłem dużo krwi i ogromne pęknięcie na całym paznokciu. Przez następne 30 minut, ja i moi przyjaciele ścigaliśmy się po centrum handlowym, szukając plastra i trochę Advil (uwaga: od tego czasu trzymam apteczkę w moim samochodzie).\r\n\r\nPo tym, jak krwawienie w końcu ustało, zostałem z pękniętym i posiniaczonym paznokciem. Moją pierwszą chęcią było zakrycie brzydkiej rany manikiurem żelowym. (Tak, to moja próżność pokazuje.) Ale okazuje się, że to najgorsze, co można zrobić.\r\n\r\nTo doświadczenie nauczyło mnie, że mam *dużo* pytań o to, co robić, gdy zranię się w paznokieć. Wiem, że nie jestem pierwszą osobą, która trzaska palcem drzwi samochodu lub blokuje okno, więc skierowałam swoje pytania do profesjonalistów, aby uzyskać wszystkie odpowiedzi, od podstawowej pierwszej pomocy po właściwy sposób zatuszowania posiniaczony paznokieć lub inny nieszczęśliwy wypadek. Oto, co musisz wiedzieć.\r\n\r\n## Co powoduje siniaczenie paznokci?\r\n\r\nPodobnie jak w przypadku siniaków na dowolnej części ciała, siniaki na paznokciach zdarzają się, gdy tępa siła zmiażdży małe naczynia krwionośne pod skórą, perU.S. Narodowa Biblioteka Medyczna. Większość urazów paznokci dotyka płytki paznokcia (twardą część paznokcia, która wyrasta), która może pękać i potencjalnie odpaść, oraz łożysko paznokcia (skóra pod płytką paznokcia), która może krwawić i siniaczyć. Więc kiedy mówimy o siniaku paznokcia, tak naprawdę mówimy o siniaku *płytki* paznokcia.\r\n\r\nTo powiedziawszy, to, co możesz założyć, to siniak paznokcia z powodu fioletowego lub czarnego koloru, może w rzeczywistości być krwią, ponieważ ten sam rodzaj urazu, który powoduje siniaki, może również powodować krwawienie. Według American Osteopathic College of Dermatology oficjalna nazwa to krwiak podpaznokciowy. To po prostu oznacza pęcherz krwi pod paznokciem.\r\n\r\n## Co mam zrobić, jeśli zranię się w paznokieć?\r\n\r\nKiedy uraz nastąpi po raz pierwszy, możesz zająć się wszelkimi natychmiastowymi potrzebami pierwszej pomocy. Obowiązuje tu podstawowa pielęgnacja rany: jeśli wystąpi, naciskaj na obszar, aby spowolnić krwawienie, oczyść ranę wodą z mydłem, załóż bandaż i weź środek przeciwbólowy, aby złagodzić ból, jeśli to konieczne. Możesz również zamrozić palec, jeśli masz obrzęk w okolicy, dermatolog Ted Lain, MD, mówi SELF.\r\n\r\nRobiąc to wszystko, powinieneś również ocenić rozmiar szkód i czy konieczna jest wizyta u lekarza. Mówiąc o...\r\n\r\n## Kiedy powinienem iść do lekarza?\r\n\r\nJest kilka rzeczy, na które należy zwrócić uwagę przy podejmowaniu decyzji, czy zaraz po zranieniu paznokcia powinnaś udać się do lekarza. Niektóre znaki obejmują:\r\n\r\n- **Brak przepływu krwi**: Uciśnij część paznokcia lub palca, która nie jest zraniona. Jeśli obszar zmieni kolor na biały, a następnie zmieni kolor na różowy w ciągu kilku sekund po zwolnieniu nacisku, masz dobre uzupełnienie naczyń włosowatych. Oznacza to, że krew wciąż płynie. Jeśli nie, dobrze jest to sprawdzić.\r\n- **Utrata czucia:** należy również dotknąć czubkiem palca, aby upewnić się, że nadal czujesz się w okolicy. „Dopóki czujesz wszystko, prawdopodobnie nie masz żadnych uszkodzeń nerwów” – mówi dr Lain.\r\n- **Niezwykłe kolory na czubku palca:** Chcesz się również upewnić, że skóra na czubku palca nie jest niebieska ani zblednięta na biało – nietypowe kolory to znak, że musisz udać się do lekarza.\r\n- **Dużo krwi pod łożyskiem paznokcia:** Ponieważ duże krwiaki podpaznokciowe zwiększają ryzyko wypadnięcia paznokcia, lekarze często usuwają nagromadzoną krew, wywiercając mały otwór w płytce paznokcia. W doświadczeniu klinicznym dr Lain krew, która obejmuje ponad 50 procent paznokcia, jest dobrym znakiem, że powinieneś skontaktować się z lekarzem, ale nie ma oficjalnych zaleceń. Możesz grać bezpiecznie i spuścić mniejszy krwiak podpaznokciowy. Kluczem jest zrobienie tego w ciągu 24 godzin, zanim krew skrzepnie.\r\n- **Uraz macierzy paznokcia:** Jest to tkanka u podstawy paznokcia, w której następuje wzrost paznokcia. Ponieważ uszkodzenie macierzy paznokcia może spowodować dziwny wzrost paznokcia do końca życia, na wszelki wypadek należy pozwolić profesjonalistom ocenić, jak poważne jest to zadanie. „Jeżeli ciśnienie może zostać zwolnione, możemy realnie pomóc kontrolować wszelkie uszkodzenia, które mogą się przydarzyć macierzy paznokcia” – mówi dr Lain.\r\n\r\nJeśli jesteś wolny od powyższych znaków, prawdopodobnie dobrze jest pominąć lekarza i pozwolić, aby siniak sam się zagoił. Jeśli chodzi o pęknięty paznokieć, będziesz musiał poczekać, aż uszkodzenie wyrośnie. (Ciekawostka: paznokcie u rąk rosną średnio o 3,47 milimetra miesięcznie, zgodnie z jednym z badań opublikowanych w 2010 roku w *Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology*.)\r\n\r\nWszystko to powiedziawszy, w ciągu kilku dni po kontuzji należy również zwracać uwagę na oznaki infekcji.\r\n\r\n## Jakie są oznaki infekcji paznokci?\r\n\r\n„Jeśli pojawi się jakakolwiek ropa, jeśli stanie się naprawdę czerwona i gorąca po fakcie, lub pojawi się duży obrzęk, jest to oznaką infekcji”, mówi dermatolog Mona Gohara, MD, SELF. „Jeśli jest zielony, to kolejny znak, że są tam bakterie”. Może również występować uporczywy ból, który po prostu nie ustępuje. Te objawy są oznakami, że musisz udać się do lekarza. Umów się na wizytę u dermatologa, lekarza podstawowej opieki zdrowotnej lub w przychodni pilnej, aby osuszyć ranę i uzyskać receptę na antybiotyki.\r\n\r\nJeśli widzisz czerwone smugi na dłoni lub przedramieniu lub czujesz gorączkę lub mdłości, może to być znacznie poważniejsze. Są to oznaki, że infekcja rozprzestrzeniła się do krwiobiegu, co może prowadzić do sepsy. „Sepsa jest niezwykle poważna i każdy, kto widzi, jak infekcja pogarsza się wraz z rozprzestrzenianiem się na rękę, powinien szukać pomocy w izbie przyjęć” – mówi dr Lain.\r\n\r\n## Co powinienem zrobić, jeśli mój paznokieć zacznie odpadać (lub całkowicie odpadnie)?\r\nTak, wypadający paznokieć może się zdarzyć, więc dobrze się na to przygotować. Po ostrym urazie paznokieć może stać się czarny i wydawać się, że ledwo się trzyma. Proszę, proszę, nie ściągaj tego. Możesz go skrócić, ale niech uraz sam się rozwinie. „Zostaw to w spokoju, ponieważ pod spodem rośnie nowy paznokieć” – mówi dr Lain. „Nowy gwóźdź podniesie stary i odpadnie, gdy będzie gotowy”.\r\n\r\nGdy paznokieć odpadnie, dobrze jest zabezpieczyć wrażliwą skórę łożyska paznokcia plastrem. „Jeśli zostawisz go na wolnym powietrzu, może bardzo wyschnąć i bardzo pęknąć, a jeśli ulegnie traumie, może to wpłynąć na wzrost paznokcia” – mówi dr Lain.\r\n\r\nW niektórych przypadkach, na przykład w przypadku infekcji łożyska paznokcia, lekarz może być zmuszony do usunięcia paznokcia siłą. Ta procedura nazywana jest wyrwaniem się paznokcia: najpierw znieczula się palec za pomocą miejscowego odrętwienia. Następnie za pomocą specjalnych narzędzi unosi paznokieć z każdej strony i odkleja płytkę od łożyska paznokcia. (Trochę brzmi jak coś z horroru, prawda?)\r\n\r\n## Czy mogę wykonać manicure z posiniaczonym paznokciem?\r\n\r\nOto, co naprawdę chciałem wiedzieć: Czy mogę pokryć pęknięty lub posiniaczony paznokieć ładnym lakierem, gdy się goi? Odpowiedź brzmi: tak — z kilkoma środkami ostrożności.\r\n\r\nDr Lain zaleca, aby najpierw pokryć paznokieć warstwą utwardzacza do paznokci, aby pomóc chronić płytkę paznokcia, a dr Gohara mówi, że lakier do paznokci jest całkowicie w porządku, jeśli na paznokciu jest tylko pęknięcie (po ustaniu krwawienia i kontuzji miał oczywiście trochę czasu na wyleczenie).\r\n\r\nTo powiedziawszy, powinieneś przerwać nawyk manicure żelowego. „Niepokoi mnie nie nakładanie żelu, czy sam produkt, ale proces usuwania” – mówi dr Lain. „Lakier żelowy jest często usuwany nieprawidłowo, co prowadzi do naruszenia integralności paznokcia lub pogorszenia podstawowych uszkodzeń”.\r\n\r\nPrzede wszystkim obie dermy mówią o unikaniu salonu paznokci. „Jeśli ktoś używa nożyczek i cięcia, możesz wprowadzić bakterie lub grzyby, ponieważ paznokieć został już naruszony” – mówi dr Gohara. Najlepiej trzymać się manicure DIY, dopóki paznokieć nie odrośnie. Na szczęście i tak unikamy teraz salonów paznokci, prawda?\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '/resources/images/bruised_nail_hand.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/bruised-fingernail', 1, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (79, 13, 'Próbowałem 5 sposobów, aby przestać obgryzać paznokcie i tylko 1 zrobił różnicę.md', 'Spoiler alert: Putting food on your fingers is not the best deterrent.', '﻿![Image may contain Human Person and Face](/resources/images/nail_biting.jpeg)\r\n\r\nJeśli rok 2020 czegoś nas nauczył, to przyspieszony kurs prawidłowej higieny rąk. Przed tym rokiem wielu z nas myślało, że obchodzimy się z dłońmi i palcami jak profesjonaliści, ale spójrzmy prawdzie w oczy, wielu z nas miało mniej niż idealne nawyki. Może skąpiłeś zasady 20-sekundowego mycia rąk, a może miałeś czyste ręce, ale używałeś ich do dotykania twarzy i ciągłego wycierania oczu. A są tacy, którzy próbując, jak tylko możemy, nie potrafią wymyślić, jak przestać obgryzać paznokcie.\r\n\r\nJeśli jesteś (tak jak ja) wśród obgryzających paznokcie ludzi na świecie, to prawdopodobnie odkryłeś, co następuje: Obgryzanie paznokci nie kończy się tylko dlatego, że tego chcemy. Zgaduję że? Mimo że stawka jest wysoka, biorąc pod uwagę nową pandemię koronawirusa, wielu z nas prawdopodobnie ma trudności z unikaniem od czasu do czasu obgryzania naszych gruboziarnistych paznokci. Nie jesteś sam. Na długo przed tym, jak nowy koronawirus zakłócił nasze życie, pisarka Emily Rekstis wypróbowała kilka typowych hacków, aby sprawdzić, czy może zerwać z nałogiem. Znajdziesz te wskazówki poniżej. Ale zanim do tego przejdziemy, przejdźmy przez kilka podstaw, dobrze?\r\n\r\n## Dlaczego ludzie obgryzają paznokcie?\r\n\r\nMożesz tego nie wiedzieć, ale obgryzanie paznokci należy do listy zachowań znanych jako zaburzenia powtarzalne skupione na ciele (lub BFRD), które są tymi małymi nawykami, które mamy (myślę, że wyrywanie włosów lub skubanie skóry), które, gdy są wykonywane wystarczająco często, mogą powodować zrobić krzywdę. Jak informowaliśmy wcześniej, nie jest do końca jasne, dlaczego niektórzy ludzie mają BFRD, ale istnieją znane wyzwalacze. SELF wcześniej informował, że te wyzwalacze dzielą się na pięć głównych kategorii: Istnieją wyzwalacze zmysłowe, które mogą być wszystkim, co wywołuje zmysły (smak, dotyk, wzrok, węch lub słuch). Możesz zostać wyzwolony przez pewne myśli lub przekonania (są to tak zwane wyzwalacze poznawcze). Możesz obgryzać paznokcie, gdy napotykasz coś, co nazywa się wyzwalaczem motorycznym, co obejmuje postawy i ruchy, które wykonujesz (i możesz nawet nie być tego świadomy). Nawet niektóre miejsca mogą sprawić, że twoje paznokcie będą bardziej powszechne (są to tak zwane wyzwalacze ustawiania).\r\n\r\n## Czy obgryzanie paznokci jest rzeczywiście takie złe?\r\n\r\nOto rzecz: niektóre wirusy żyją na powierzchniach, a kiedy dotykamy tych miejsc (takich jak klamki lub szyny metra), a następnie dotykamy oczu, nosa lub ust, ryzykujemy, że te zarazki przedostaną się do naszych ciał, Philip Tierno, Ph. .D., mikrobiolog i kliniczny profesor patologii na NYU Langone, powiedział wcześniej SELF. Nie jest oczywiste, że obgryzanie paznokci sprawi, że będziesz chorować częściej niż ci, którzy tego nie robią, ale wkładanie palców do ust nie wyświadcza Twojemu układowi odpornościowemu żadnej przysługi.\r\n\r\nAle nawet jeśli nie myślisz o zarazkach, obgryzanie paznokci może również spowodować uszkodzenie łożyska paznokcia, wyjaśnia Klinika Mayo. Może to pozostawić drobne skaleczenia, które narażają Cię na większe ryzyko, że bakterie i grzyby będą spędzać czas i powodować infekcje, mówi Klinika Mayo. Według Kliniki Mayo obgryzanie paznokci może również potencjalnie uszkodzić zęby. Wszystko to oznacza, że najlepiej trzymać paznokcie z dala od ust. Więc jak to zrobić, możesz się zastanawiać?\r\n\r\n## Są rzeczy, które możesz zrobić, aby przestać obgryzać paznokcie.\r\n\r\nDla niektórych osób może być możliwe przejście na zimnego indyka, ale wiele osób będzie potrzebować pewnych strategii, aby nimi pokierować. Porady American Academy of Dermatology Association (AADA) to świetny początek. Oferują mieszankę praktycznych strategii, a także ćwiczeń umysłowych, które mogą ci pomóc. Na przykład, wśród strategii zalecanych przez AADA jest identyfikacja wyzwalaczy obgryzania paznokci, utrzymywanie krótkich paznokci i przyjmowanie stopniowego podejścia (jak w przypadku pracy nad zatrzymaniem obgryzania jednego paznokcia na raz). AADA wyjaśnia również, że obgryzanie paznokci może być oznaką stresu emocjonalnego lub psychicznego. Więc jeśli próbowałeś przestać obgryzać paznokcie i nie możesz, nie ma nic złego w skontaktowaniu się z lekarzem w celu omówienia swoich obaw. A jeśli rozwinie się infekcja spowodowana obgryzaniem paznokci, dermatolog lub inny pracownik służby zdrowia może pomóc w jej leczeniu, mówi AADA.\r\n\r\n## Oto, co się stało, gdy Emily Rekstis próbowała przełamać swój nawyk obgryzania paznokci. Oto, co powiedziała:\r\n\r\nObgryzanie paznokci to straszny nawyk, którego nie mogę odrzucić. Sięgnąłem do Internetu i rozmawiałem z ekspertami, aby znaleźć najlepsze hacki, które, mam nadzieję, pomogą mi zerwać z nałogiem. Oto jak przebiegł mój mały eksperyment:\r\n\r\n1. Zamoczyłam paznokcie w soli.\r\n\r\n![Image may contain Human Person and Nail](/resources/images/IMG_5229.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW przeszłości używałem pasty przeciw gryzieniu, takiej jak Maval Stop Polish (31 USD, Walmart), więc tym razem nie chciałem tego próbować. Zamiast tego wybrałem rozwiązanie DIY, które służyło temu samemu celowi. Ten hack znalazłem podczas przewijania wielu wątków na Reddit na temat obgryzania paznokci: Najpierw zanurzasz paznokcie w wodzie. Następnie zanurzasz je w soli i odkurzasz część nadmiaru (zabawne, jest to ten sam proces, którego używam, gdy nakładam sól na brzeg kieliszka do margarity).\r\n\r\nPodobnie jak lakier przeciw gryzieniu, sól ma pozostawiać w ustach nieprzyjemny smak podczas obgryzania paznokci. „Ten nieatrakcyjny smak jest wart wypróbowania, jeśli szukasz rozwiązania dla majsterkowiczów”, wyjaśnia dermatolog Melanie D. Palm, MD. „Ale niektórzy mogą nie uznać tego za wystarczający środek odstraszający, a granulki soli mogą spowodować bałagan”. Wskazuje również, że jeśli pocierasz oko palcami pokrytymi solą, może to naprawdę szczypać i boleć. Mając to na uwadze, postanowiłem spróbować.\r\n\r\n**Zadziałało?**\r\n\r\nMówiąc najprościej – nie, to nie zadziałało i z wielu różnych powodów. Po pierwsze, trudno było utrzymać sól na paznokciach. Było dobrze, gdybym po prostu oglądał telewizję lub czytał. Ale kiedy robiłem to przed rozpoczęciem pracy na komputerze, sól spadała i robiła bałagan na klawiaturze. Zrobiłem to również przed wyjściem pewnej nocy, więc wytarłem część (właściwie większość) przed wejściem do metra. Po prostu czułem się trochę niechlujnie i dziwnie, gdy moje palce były pokryte solą. Po usunięciu niektórych pozostała jeszcze delikatna nuta soli. Jednak tak naprawdę mi to nie przeszkadzało.\r\n\r\nCo prowadzi mnie do innego powodu, dla którego tak naprawdę nie działało. Kocham sól! Nie lubię dużych ilości tego, jakie zbierałyby moje palce, gdy po raz pierwszy zostały w nim zanurzone. Ale niewyraźne ślady pozostawione przez sól po tym, jak większość jej odpadnie, nie powstrzymały mnie przed włożeniem palca do ust. Jedyne, co powiem, to to, że smak soli przypomina mi, że moje paznokcie były w ustach, kiedy nie powinny – nie jest to świetny środek odstraszający, ale dobry dzwonek na pobudkę.\r\n\r\n2. Potarłam jalapeños na każdym paznokciu.\r\n\r\n![Image may contain Human Person Finger Nail and Hand](/resources/images/IMG_5213.JPG)\r\n\r\nTo był kolejny hack Reddit, który znalazłem w tym samym wątku, co końcówka soli, a założenie jest takie samo: nałożenie złego smaku na paznokcie, abyś nie mógł ich dalej gryźć. Kupiłem słoik plasterków jalapeño i natarłem sokiem całe skórki i paznokcie. Palm zauważa: „Jest to stosunkowo bezpieczne, ale należy upewnić się, że nie są uczuleni na pieprz lub przypadkowo pocierają twarz i oczy, ponieważ może to spowodować ostrą reakcję”. Nie mam alergii na paprykę, więc poszłam na to. Byłem bardzo – BARDZO – ostrożny, żeby później nie pocierać oczu.\r\n\r\n**Zadziałało?**\r\n\r\nTo zadziałało trochę lepiej niż sól, ponieważ smak był bardziej szokujący, gdy uderzył mnie językiem. Moja ręka natychmiast wyciągnęłaby się z ust. Szok ostrej papryczki jalapeño nie jest czymś, do czego przywykłeś bez innego jedzenia. Jednak pikantność trwała tylko godzinę i w przeciwieństwie do soli, tak naprawdę nie było nawet najmniejszego śladu pozostałości. Więc kiedy byłam poza domem przez dłuższy czas, to mijało i w końcu znowu odgryzałam.\r\n\r\nAle prawdziwym powodem, dla którego nie mogę polecić tego, jest czysta czynnik obrzydliwości. Jeśli myślałem, że sól jest brudna, to było jeszcze bardziej brudne. Moje palce były lepkie i śmierdzące po tym, jak natarłam je pieprzem. Nawet gdybym trzymała go przy paznokciu, soki kapały mi na palce. Czułem się, jakbym musiał umyć ręce po tym, ponieważ, szczerze mówiąc, zrobiłem! Ale wtedy byłoby to sprzeczne z celem używania jalapeño.\r\n\r\n3. Noszę nożyczki do skórek.\r\n\r\n![This image may contain Human Person Manicure Nail Jewelry Accessories Accessory Ring and Finger](/resources/images/IMG_5243.JPG)\r\n\r\nKiedy mówię, że obgryzam paznokcie, mam na myśli obgryzanie paznokci i odrywanie otaczających je skórek. Niestety oznacza to, że moje skórki są obolałe i często krwawią. Noszenie przy sobie obcinacza do skórek, takiego jak Revlon Full Jaw Cuticle Cutter (14 USD, Walmart), miało dać mi sposób na poradzenie sobie z poszarpanymi skórkami, abym nie dłubała ich zębami. „Niektórzy ludzie są w stanie uniknąć manipulowania skórkami poprzez przycinanie ich, gdy mają ochotę je zrywać”, wyjaśnia współpracownik RealSelf, dr Sejal Shah. Miałem nadzieję, że jestem jednym z tych „niektórych ludzi”, o których mówiła.\r\n\r\n**Zadziałało?**\r\n\r\nTak i nie. Tak, ponieważ posiadanie pod ręką nożyczek (gra słów zamierzonych) powstrzymywało mnie przed używaniem ust do czyszczenia paznokci lub skórek. Mając to na uwadze, posiadanie ich w pobliżu prawie zwróciło większą uwagę na pracę, której potrzebowały moje paznokcie i skórki. Zaczęłam mieć obsesję na punkcie utrzymywania czystych i precyzyjnych skórek. Wyciągnęłabym nożyczki w każdej chwili – i w dowolnym miejscu – gdybym zauważyła problem. Nie radzę sobie zbyt dobrze z nożyczkami, więc prawie zawsze pomieszałam skórki i paznokcie jeszcze bardziej, a potem spędzałabym więcej czasu na ich naprawie.\r\n\r\nNożyczki trzymały moje ręce z dala od ust. Ale to nie pomogło w moich poszukiwaniach mocniejszych, dłuższych, zdrowszych paznokci i skórek. W rzeczywistości moje skórki wyglądały jeszcze gorzej po tym hakowaniu.\r\n\r\n4. Zatrzasnąłem gumkę na nadgarstku.\r\n\r\n![Image may contain Human Person Finger Female Woman Blonde Teen Girl Kid and Child](/resources/images/IMG_5209.JPG)\r\n\r\nPomysł polegał na zastąpieniu tego, który próbowałem przełamać, innym nawykiem nerwowym. W przeciwieństwie do soli i jalapeño, ten siekanie zajmowało moje ręce czymś innym niż obgryzanie paznokci. „To w zasadzie alternatywne zachowanie” — wyjaśnia Shah. „Obgryzanie paznokci lub zbieranie skórek to często nerwowe nawyki lub sposób na złagodzenie stresu, więc angażując się w alternatywne zachowanie, gdy poczujesz potrzebę, szczególnie takie, które sprawia, że ręce są zajęte, możesz uniknąć obgryzania paznokci”.\r\n\r\n**Zadziałało?**\r\n\r\nNie całkiem. Nie ma zbyt wiele do powiedzenia na ten temat, ponieważ po prostu nie działał. Myślę, że może gdybym dalej to robiła, to podświadomie zaczęłabym sięgać po gumkę zamiast wbijać paznokcie między zęby. Jednak moją natychmiastową reakcją było włożenie paznokci do ust, a nie na nadgarstek. Gdy łapałem się, że chodzę palcami do ust, szedłem do gumki, ale innym razem było już za późno i już obgryzałem paznokcie.\r\n\r\n5. Właśnie pomyślałem o wszystkich bakteriach na moich palcach.\r\n\r\n![Image may contain Human Person Manicure Nail Jewelry Ring Accessories and Accessory](/resources/images/IMG_5198.JPG)\r\n\r\nJedną z motywacji powrotu na wóz bez gryzienia było to, że w ciągu ostatnich dwóch miesięcy dwukrotnie dostałam zapalenia migdałków i jestem przekonana, że to z powodu zarazków, które wkładam do ust podczas obgryzania paznokci. Zapytałem o to dwóch lekarzy i chociaż obaj stwierdzili, że zdecydowanie przełykam obrzydliwość — mieszkam w Nowym Jorku na miłość boską! — jest mało prawdopodobne, że to właśnie powoduje moje choroby.\r\n\r\nMój strach (jakkolwiek bezpodstawny) okazał się jednak działać na moją korzyść, kiedy spróbowałem praktyki mentalnej, która ciągle pojawiała się w moich badaniach. Za każdym razem, gdy łapałem się na wkładaniu rąk do ust, myślałem o tym, gdzie były moje ręce tego dnia, o wszystkich zarazkach, które mogły na nich być i jak bardzo chciałem nie zachorować. Psycholog Emma Seppälä mówi SELF, że używanie moich obaw związanych z połknięciem bakterii do walki z chęcią ugryzienia ma wiele sensu. „Sposoby na przełamanie złych nawyków wzmacniają siłę woli poprzez ćwiczenia takie jak uważność i medytacja” – mówi. Wykorzystanie mojej reakcji emocjonalnej może pomóc mi oprzeć się pokusie mojego zakorzenionego zachowania.\r\n\r\nChociaż wiem, że obgryzanie paznokci i zapalenie migdałków nie są bezpośrednio związane, mogę wykorzystać moje wyraźne wspomnienia bólu gardła i gorączki jako łatwego narzędzia do zerwania z nałogiem.\r\n\r\n**Zadziałało?**\r\n\r\nCo zaskakujące, ta sztuczka wydawała się działać najlepiej. Ponieważ naprawdę nie chcę obgryzać paznokci, przestałem, gdy zauważyłem, co robię. Trudno jednak powiedzieć, czy to zawsze zadziała. Ponieważ pracowałam nad opowieścią o obgryzaniu paznokci, często o tym myślałam i robiłam notatki do tego utworu. Jednak na co dzień obgryzam paznokcie, nawet nie zdając sobie sprawy, że robię to wiele razy. W tym miejscu pojawiają się inne hacki, takie jak sól i jalapeño. Być może nie odwróciły mnie od tego, ale uświadomiły mi, że moje ręce są w ustach – co przyniosło im korzyści na swój sposób.\r\n\r\n## Lekcja: Jeśli chodzi o obgryzanie paznokci, pomaga uważność.\r\n\r\nTe hacki nie pomogły bardziej niż moja mama nakładająca pastę przeciw ugryzieniom, gdy byłam młodsza. Czy znowu będę wcierał sól lub papryczki jalapeño w paznokcie? Nie definitywnie nie. Mogę jednak nadal nosić ze sobą nożyczki do skórek, więc jeśli znajdę obsesję na punkcie jakiejś szorstkiej skóry, mogę się nią zająć bez zwracania się do zębów. Najlepszą rzeczą, jaka wyszła z moich testów, było uświadomienie sobie, że obgryzanie paznokci jest wyraźnie podświadomym zachowaniem, które robię, gdy jestem niespokojny i znudzony, więc najlepszą rzeczą, jaką mogę zrobić, to zauważyć i przestać. Świadomość tego, że obgryzam paznokcie – oraz kiedy, gdzie i jak często to robię – jest pierwszym krokiem do tego, by nie obgryzać paznokci. Więc na tym się skupię. A kiedy to robię, myślenie o wszystkich wulgarnych zarazkach na moich palcach jest wystarczającą motywacją, aby trzymać je z dala od moich ust. Przynajmniej na razie.\r\n\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-11 13:23:38', '/resources/images/nail_biting.jpeg', 'https://www.self.com/story/nail-biting-hacks', 1, 0);

Jednakże, gdy kupujesz coś za pośrednictwem naszych linków detalicznych, możemy otrzymać prowizję partnerską.\r\n\r\nChciałam nienawidzić pudełka do manicure Everything od Olive & June. Sceptyczna strona mnie pomyślała: Nie ma mowy, żeby to był dobry interes. *80$?* Żeby zrobić własne paznokcie? Proszę. Mimo to tęskniłam za manicure – by poczuć przypływ radości i normalności na widok moich pięknych, pomalowanych dłoni, nawet jeśli niedługo nie wybieram się na żadne formalne imprezy lub do biura. Więc kiedy otrzymałem próbkę, postanowiłem spróbować z otwartym umysłem i trochę niechętnie, naprawdę bardzo lubię to dang box. To sprawia, że robienie własnych paznokci jest o wiele przyjemniejsze niż kiedykolwiek wcześniej.\r\n\r\nDla małego tła: mam długotrwały związek z paznokciami/manicure. Ssałem kciuk aż do piątego roku życia, kiedy mój dentysta przekonał mnie do tego (obietnicą ogromnego wypchanego renifera, którego nazwałem, bez kłamstwa, Rudolph Giuliani). Ale zamiast tego zająłem się obgryzaniem paznokci. W młodości próbowałam rzucić palenie, używając gorzkiego smaku pasty, która miała mnie zniechęcić, ale to nie zadziałało. Kontynuowałam żucie paznokci, nienawidziłam siebie za to, a co za tym idzie, skręcałam się i bardziej je obgryzałam.\r\n\r\nW wieku 20 lat, po tym, jak przeprowadziłam się do Nowego Jorku i dostałam swoją pierwszą pracę, w końcu przestałam obgryzać paznokcie dzięki regularnym żelowym manicure. Z jednej strony tak, już nie obgryzam paznokci! Z drugiej strony uzależniłem się od salonów, wydając 40 dolarów co dwa tygodnie na wymianę odcieni. Było to niezwykle kosztowne, wyczerpujące wykorzystanie czasu i — kiedy wsadziłem ręce pod UV. lekki do wysuszenia żel – potencjalnie szkodliwy dla mojej skóry. Zdałem sobie sprawę, że nie mogę ani nie chcę * spędzić reszty życia na zamianie jednego nawyku na inny. W końcu całkowicie zrezygnowałam z manicure i po prostu pozwoliłam moim naturalnym paznokciom żyć i rosnąć. Zacząłem więcej ćwiczyć, aby (nieco) radzić sobie z lękiem i z przyjemnością informuję, że od kilku lat nie obgryzałem paznokci. Nie jestem już uzależniona od manicure w ramach mojej rutyny, co dziwnie uwalnia mnie od tęsknoty za nimi jako z samoopieki. Kiedy pandemia zmusiła mnie do pozostania w domu (co jest, zdaję sobie sprawę, przywilejem), zacząłem tęsknić za rozpieszczaniem rąk. Wejdź do pola wszystkiego.\r\n\r\nWewnątrz tego jasnoróżowego pudełka znajduje się, zgodnie z nazwą, wszystko, czego potrzebujesz do manicure o jakości salonowej, w tym konkretne wskazówki i triki (np. jak dbać o skórki), sześć wybranych kolorów paznokci (od subtelnych aktów po błyszczące neony), oraz błyszczący, szybkoschnący top coat. Jako ktoś, kto stara się znaleźć lakier, który nie jest zbyt wodnisty ani grudkowy, mogę ręczyć za to, że ten lakier działa równomiernie i cudownie utrzymuje się przez co najmniej tydzień. Pędzel do butelki ma odpowiedni rozmiar i kształt, aby pokryć powierzchnię paznokcia w dwóch do trzech pociągnięć (coś, co sprawia mi kłopoty z cieńszymi butelkami z pędzelkami takich marek jak Essie i Sally Hansen).\r\n\r\nAle najlepszą częścią zestawu, co tak naprawdę sprawia, że jest „wszystko”, są narzędzia, których jest wiele: garnek do zmywacza do paznokci (którym używa się z satysfakcjonującym nasączeniem palca w małej gąbeczce) , obcinacz do paznokci (zaprojektowany z płaską krawędzią do poziomego przycinania), pilnik do paznokci o podwójnym ziarnie (o wiele mocniejszy niż moje cienkie szmerglówki), kostka buforowa (do modelowania, wygładzania i utrzymywania skórek w jednej linii), uniwersalny lakier uchwyt butelki (gumowa wkładka, która zakrywa górną część rączki lakieru i znacznie ułatwia nakładanie lakieru, zwłaszcza niedominującą ręką), serum do skórek (wykonane z odżywczego kwiatu kaktusa) i pędzelek do czyszczenia (moja osobista ulubione narzędzie). Bez względu na to, jak brudny jest mój manicure, na koniec używam tego delikatnego pędzelka zanurzonego w zmywaczu do czyszczenia zabłąkanego lakieru i presto, moje paznokcie wyglądają, jakby widziały wnętrze salonu.\r\n\r\nRealistycznie rzecz biorąc, 80 dolarów nie jest finansowo wykonalne dla wszystkich. Za 50 USD Olive & June oferuje również Studio Box, które zawiera wszystkie narzędzia oraz jeden wybrany przez Ciebie lakier i warstwę nawierzchniową. Za 42 USD możesz kupić zestaw narzędzi, który zawiera tylko narzędzia, które można sparować z dowolnymi lakierami, które już posiadasz. FWIW, chociaż z pewnością możesz kupić wszystko w tych zestawach po kawałku, za tę cenę, otrzymujesz starannie zaprojektowane, wysokiej jakości produkty i porady ekspertów, a wszystko to w przyjemnym pakiecie.

Ponieważ ciągle otwieram paczki i piszę historie, noszenie żelowego lakieru do paznokci było ratunkiem, jeśli chodzi o zachowanie mojego mani. Chociaż uwielbiam elastyczność, jaką zapewnia zwykły manicure, lakier żelowy jest o wiele trwalszy – dlatego staram się rozciągać każdy manicure tak długo, jak to możliwe.\r\n\r\n„Dzięki lakierowi hybrydowemu Twój manicure może trwać od dwóch do trzech tygodni, ale przy zwykłym lakierze masz szczęście, jeśli trwa od pięciu do siedmiu dni bez odprysków”, mówi SELF Kristin Pulaski, właścicielka Paintbucket Nails na Brooklynie. Według Pułaskiego, oprócz trwałości, kolejną wielką zaletą żelu jest to, że zapewnia twardszą warstwę ochronną na naturalnym paznokciu, co może skutkować zwiększonym wzrostem paznokcia.\r\n\r\nNiestety ta trwałość i ochrona może być szorstka dla Twoich paznokci i osłabiać je oraz powodować rozdwajanie. Nikt tego nie chce, więc należy pamiętać o kilku rzeczach, aby zachować zdrowie paznokci, gdy otrzymujesz żele. Poprosiliśmy Pułaskiego, znaną manikiurzystkę Skyy Hadley i Christy Harpring, współwłaścicielkę Sea Salt and Sugar Nail Bar w Savannah w stanie Georgia, aby wskazali nam błędy, których należy unikać.\r\n\r\n## 1. Wykonujesz manicure żelowy jeden po drugim.\r\n\r\nPonieważ usuwanie i nakładanie żelowego lakieru do paznokci może powodować duże zużycie paznokci, powinieneś rozłożyć manicure. „Dostając żelowe paznokcie konsekwentnie co dwa tygodnie, płytka paznokcia bardzo się dusi” – wyjaśnia Hadley. Może to prowadzić do odwodnienia paznokci i ostatecznie do ich złamania, więc pamiętaj, aby zapewnić paznokciom przerwę między żelami. „Ważne jest, aby profesjonalna stylistka paznokci oceniała stan paznokci między aplikacjami, aby ustalić, czy Twoje paznokcie mogą skorzystać z urlopu po polerowaniu” – wyjaśnia Harpring.\r\n\r\n## 2. Zbyt długo pozostawiasz żel do polerowania.\r\n\r\nPonieważ żelowy lakier do paznokci można nosić całymi tygodniami bez najmniejszego nawet odprysku, wydłużanie żywotności manicure jest kuszące. Hadley sugeruje jednak usunięcie manicure żelowego maksymalnie po dwóch do trzech tygodniach, aby uniknąć uszkodzenia łożysk paznokci i skórek. Harpring zgadza się z tym, dodając, że nadmierne przedłużanie paznokci żelowych może nie tylko prowadzić do osłabienia paznokci, ale także wprowadzić potencjalnie szkodliwe bakterie. „Ważne jest, aby pamiętać, że gdy żel zaczyna się podnosić, pozwala wilgoci dostać się pod żel i prawdopodobnie prowadzić do rozwoju bakterii” – wyjaśnia Harpring.\r\n\r\n## 3. Usuwasz stary manicure żelowy bez fachowej pomocy.\r\n\r\nGdy manicure żelowy jest już na ostatniej nodze, możesz pokusić się o jego samodzielne usunięcie, ale eksperci odradzają to. „Najbezpieczniejszym sposobem usunięcia pasty do żelu jest profesjonalista”, mówi Harpring.\r\n\r\nJeśli absolutnie nie możesz dotrzeć do salonu w celu usunięcia, radzi najpierw delikatnie spiłować wierzch lakieru, aby usunąć połysk, co ułatwia acetonowi wnikanie i rozpuszczanie żelu. Następnie namocz waciki w acetonie (substancja chemiczna powszechnie stosowana w usuwaniu lakieru żelowego), nałóż wacik na każdy paznokieć i zawiń go w folię aluminiową. Pozostaw okłady na 10-15 minut, a następnie za pomocą drewnianego odciskacza do skórek delikatnie zepchnij żel z płytki paznokcia. Aby zakończyć, delikatnie poleruj powierzchnię paznokcia za pomocą narzędzia do polerowania i nałóż olej na paznokcie i skórki, aby nawilżyć.\r\n\r\n## 4. Nie używasz olejku do skórek.\r\n\r\nWedług Hadley, możesz ocenić uszkodzenia paznokci na podstawie ich elastyczności: normalne paznokcie są nieco elastyczne, ale im twardszy i wytrzymalszy gwóźdź, tym większe prawdopodobieństwo, że się złamie. Ponieważ zimna pogoda ogólnie powoduje wysuszenie skóry, odpowiednie nawilżenie skórek może mieć duże znaczenie. Ponadto aceton może bardzo wysuszyć łożysko paznokcia, powodując z czasem łamanie się paznokci lub ich łamliwość.\r\n\r\nAby zwalczyć suchość paznokci, eksperci sugerują trzymanie pod ręką olejku do skórek (gra słów nie jest przeznaczona). „Przysięgam na olejek do skórek i osobiście kocham NCLA” – mówi do SELF Pulaski. „Kiedyś myślałem, że olejek do skórek nie jest niezbędny, ale zacząłem go używać około dwa lata temu i zawsze noszę go przy sobie, zwłaszcza w chłodniejszych miesiącach!” Dodanie kilku kropli olejku do paznokci i skórek pomiędzy wizytami w salonie zapewni im nawilżenie.\r\n\r\nDbanie o dobry wygląd moich paznokci, z lakierem lub bez, to zdecydowanie priorytet. Więc chociaż prawdopodobnie nie zrezygnuję z żelowego lakieru do paznokci, zdecydowanie zastanowię się dwa razy, zanim spróbuję rozciągać mymanicure na dłużej niż dwa tygodnie na raz.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '/resources/images/woman-getting-manicure.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/gel-nail-polish-mistakes', 0, 0);

Całkowicie suszę ci włosy po prysznicu, ale twoje *palce u nóg*? To po prostu brzmiało dziwnie.\r\n\r\nOkazuje się, że nie mówiła o tym, aby lakier do paznokci szybciej wysychał (co właściwie nie działa, mówiła o zapobieganiu grzybicy stóp.\r\n\r\nLippman informuje mnie, że faktycznie dostała napiwek od swojego podiatry, Ivara Rotha, DPM, MPH z Concierge Podiatry and Spa. „Korzystanie z suszarki to coś, co wymyśliłem, aby zwalczać infekcje grzybicze stóp i paznokci” – mówi dr Roth. Uzasadnienie jest proste, wyjaśnia. Grzyby rosną w wilgotnym środowisku; zabierz wodę, a to pomaga zatrzymać wzrost.\r\n\r\nKiedy pozwolisz stopom wyschnąć na powietrzu, wyschnięcie kącików paznokci i przestrzeni między palcami może zająć do 30 minut — to miejsca, w których grzyb często zaczyna się rozwijać, mówi dr Roth. Suszenie powietrzem skraca to do około minuty, co oznacza, że jest mniej czasu na rozwój grzybów, a tym samym mniejsze prawdopodobieństwo, że wyjdziesz z łazienki lub szatni na siłowni z pączkującym przypadkiem stopy sportowca.\r\n\r\n(Uwaga, jeśli masz zmniejszone czucie bólu lub temperaturę w palcach stóp, z powodu neuropatii cukrzycowej lub innych przyczyn, nie próbuj tego w domu – możesz ryzykować oparzenie skóry).\r\n\r\nLori Weisenfeld, podiatra sportowa z Nowego Jorku, mówi SELF, że metoda ma sens. „Grzyby lubią ciepłe, ciemne miejsca, dlatego ważne jest, aby wysuszyć skórę między palcami i pod palcami” – mówi. „Twoje stopy szybko wysychają – to między palcami i pod palcami, które działają jak rezerwuar wilgoci i grzybów”. Jednak, jak mówi, wiele osób ma tendencję do zaniedbywania suszenia obszarów między palcami i pod palcami po kąpieli. Dr Weisenfeld nigdy nie zalecał pacjentom używania suszarki do włosów, ale zawsze zaleca, aby podczas suszenia stóp używali chusteczek higienicznych, a nie ręczników do ciała, ponieważ używanie tego samego ręcznika może potencjalnie rozprzestrzeniać grzyby.\r\n\r\nWedług American Podiatric Medical Association standardową radą dotyczącą zapobiegania grzybicy stóp jest noszenie butów, które nie są zbyt ciasne, aby zapewnić przepływ powietrza do stóp, a także regularne zmienianie butów i skarpet, aby stopy były suche. A jeśli weźmiesz prysznic na siłowni, będziesz chciał zainwestować w parę butów pod prysznic.\r\n\r\nJedna z pierwszych oznak, że możesz mieć do czynienia z możliwą grzybicą stóp? Małe białe plamki na paznokciach u stóp. „Białe plamy na paznokciach lub jakiekolwiek oznaki przebarwienia lub zgrubienia paznokcia mogą być oznaką, że możesz mieć do czynienia z grzybem lub pleśnią” – mówi dr Roth. „Inne objawy to łuszcząca się/sucha skóra na stopie, co może wskazywać na grzybicę skóry”. Według podiatry Emily Splichal, wielu pacjentów uważa, że ich skóra jest po prostu sucha, gdy faktycznie mają infekcję grzybiczą. Wypróbuj dostępny bez recepty środek przeciwgrzybiczy, a jeśli nie zauważysz poprawy w ciągu dwóch tygodni, skonsultuj się z podiatrą.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '/resources/images/hair-dryer.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/why-you-might-want-to-blow-dry-your-toes', 0, 0);

Nawet jeśli jesteś profesjonalistą w zakresie majsterkowania, manicure w domu nigdy nie wydaje się trwać tak długo, jak robią to prawdziwi profesjonaliści. Prostym rozwiązaniem byłoby pójście do salonu paznokci, ale nie zawsze jest to efektywne czasowo lub kosztowo. Zdecydowałem się porozmawiać z sześcioma profesjonalnymi manikiurzystkami, aby uzyskać ich wskazówki dotyczące lepszego mani w domu.\r\n\r\nOkazuje się, że popełniłem kilka typowych faux pas, które skracają życie mojego mani. I podobno jest wiele wskazówek BS (dlaczego się nie dziwię…). Na przykład ta sztuczka, w której zanurzasz świeżo pomalowane paznokcie w lodowatej wodzie, aby szybko wyschły – fałsz. Teraz zastanawiam się, co jeszcze robiłem źle.\r\n\r\nOto dziewięć sposobów na to, aby Twoje paznokcie wyglądały idealnie podczas majsterkowania manicure, według ekspertów od paznokci.\r\n\r\n\\1. Wybierz odpowiedni kształt.\r\n\r\nPomimo wszystkich modnych kształtów (jak trumna czy szpilka) okazuje się, że zaokrąglone paznokcie to najlepszy sposób, aby uniknąć rozdarcia i wyrwania. „Dzięki jego gładkiemu kształtowi jest mniej prawdopodobne, że coś się zaczepi”, mówi globalna nauczycielka Essie, Rita Remark. „Jeśli wolisz nosić kwadratowe paznokcie, pamiętaj, aby zaokrąglić krawędzie po obu stronach paznokcia”.\r\n\r\n\\2. Upewnij się, że polerujesz krawędzie paznokci.\r\n\r\nGdy już wylądujesz na ostatecznym kształcie, ważne jest, aby nic nie wisi na krawędzi. „Kiedy paznokcie są dość mocno piłowane, ważne jest, aby użyć bufora do paznokci, aby usunąć wszystkie pozostałe resztki paznokcia spod paznokcia i z boków paznokcia wzdłuż linii naskórka”, mówi Carly Narva, entuzjastka manicure i wiceprezes merchandisingu w sklepie kosmetycznym Violet Grey. Kolejna wskazówka dla profesjonalistów: upewnij się, że piłujesz w jednym kierunku, zwłaszcza bokami – dzięki temu nie będziesz naruszać włókien paznokci.\r\n\r\n\\3. Odpowiednio przygotuj paznokcie przed malowaniem.\r\n\r\nWiększość salonów paznokci każe namoczyć się przed odciśnięciem skórek i opiłowaniem, ale zawodowcy twierdzą, że suche mani są bardziej higieniczne i pomagają dłużej utrzymać lakier. Uwaga mówi, że moczenie w wodzie powoduje rozszerzenie paznokcia. Następnie, gdy wysycha, paznokieć kurczy się, powodując odpryskiwanie lakieru. Zamiast tego, mówi, oczyść paznokcie zmywaczem do paznokci lub alkoholem przed polerowaniem.\r\n\r\nNiektóre salony używają octu do namaczania przed mani, ale według redakcji Honey, jest to również niemożliwe, która wyjaśnia, że kwas w occie może powodować kruche paznokcie. „Używam octu na stopach, aby upewnić się, że nie ma bakterii, ale zwykle nie na dłoniach. Najlepszy jest manicure na sucho – mówi.\r\n\r\n\\4. Nie wstrząsaj butelką z lakierem do paznokci.\r\n\r\nWielokrotnie słyszeliśmy tę wskazówkę, ale wielu z nas nadal potrząsa naszym lakierem do paznokci, gdy jest odklejony, a potem zastanawia się, dlaczego nie otrzymujemy bezszwowego manicure. „Wolę wałkować lakier, jeśli od razu poleruję paznokcie”, wyjaśnia Gina Edwards, znana manikiurzystka z produktów Kiss. Wiele butelek ma wewnątrz małą metalową kulkę, która pomaga mieszać produkt. „Wstrząsanie tworzy bąbelki w polerowaniu i można to zobaczyć, jeśli nałożysz go niedługo po nim”, mówi, dodając, że jeśli już potrząsasz, powinieneś odczekać godzinę przed polerowaniem.\r\n\r\nHoney używa kombinacji roll-and-shake. „Niektórzy ludzie mówią, żeby nie trząść ani nie toczyć, ponieważ powoduje to powstawanie bąbelków w lakierze, ale ja robię kombinację tych dwóch na początku manicure” – wyjaśnia. „Zanim będę gotowy do użycia koloru, bąbelki opadną”.\r\n\r\n\\5. Dwie cieńsze warstwy są lepsze niż jedna gruba.\r\n\r\nChociaż kuszące jest, aby posmakować smaku z jedną grubą warstwą, nie rób tego. Kulki lakieru to po prostu dłuższy czas schnięcia i większe ryzyko rozmazywania. „Grube płaszcze są nie do przyjęcia!” wykrzykuje stylistka paznokci Gracie J. „Cienkie i równe warstwy najlepiej nadają się do uzyskania jednolitego wyglądu”.\r\n\r\nSławna manikiurzystka Sarah Chue rozkłada to nieco dalej. „Wiele cienkich warstw pozwoli na wyschnięcie lakieru w międzyczasie — używaj maksymalnie trzech warstw koloru” — mówi. „Ogólnie rzecz biorąc, jedna warstwa podkładu, dwie warstwy koloru i jedna warstwa wierzchnia. Czasami, jeśli chcesz więcej pigmentu lub kolor wydaje się nieco przezroczysty, trzecia warstwa koloru jest tolerowana.\r\n\r\nUwaga się zgadza. „Prawie każdy środek do polerowania, który znajdziesz na rynku, jest przeznaczony do polerowania dwoma warstwami, więc używaj tego jako ogólnej zasady do polerowania w domu”, mówi, dodając, „jeśli tekstura pasty jest czysta, często tak będzie dobrze wyglądać nawet z jedną warstwą. Jednak jeśli jest to kolor nieprzezroczysty, bezwzględnie wymaga co najmniej dwóch warstw”.\r\n\r\n\\6. Nakładaj produkt trzema pociągnięciami.\r\n\r\nJedno przesunięcie i wylatujesz? Nie tak szybko. „Profesjonalny sposób aplikacji to środek, a następnie boki” — mówi Edwards. „Jednakże tak długo, jak masz pełne pokrycie paznokcia, jest to naprawdę poziom komfortu dla osoby”.\r\n\r\n\\7. Unikaj ciepła podczas suszenia mani.\r\n\r\nJeśli chodzi o suszenie, wysusz je na powietrzu lub użyj podmuchu zimnego — nie gorącego — powietrza, aby pomóc. „Ciepło faktycznie zapobiega jędrności lakieru. Zimne powietrze działa odwrotnie”, mówi Chue. „[Jeśli się spieszysz], wypróbuj szybkoschnące krople po kilku minutach suszenia”. W przypadku manicure w domu Narva lubi odczekać od 5 do 10 minut i użyć jednej kropli nietoksycznych szybkoschnących kropli Tenoverten (18 USD) na każdy paznokieć, trzymając ręce skierowane w dół, aby kropla pokryła cały paznokieć.\r\n\r\n\\8. Napraw błędy JAK NAJSZYBCIEJ.\r\n\r\nJesteś trochę nadgorliwy w stosunku do polerowania? To szybka naprawa. „Użyj patyczka z płaską krawędzią, zanurz go w acetonie i po każdym gwoździu poprowadź go wokół eponychium” – wyjaśnia Gracie J (eponychium to obszar naskórka). „W ten sposób nie czekasz do końca, kiedy pasta wyschnie w szczelinach.”\r\n\r\nW przypadku rozmazań możesz delikatnie palcem wcisnąć pastę z powrotem na miejsce przed nałożeniem warstwy wierzchniej. „Jeśli jest to niemożliwe do naprawienia, na przykład w przypadku wgnieceń, najlepiej po prostu go wytrzeć i zrobić ponownie” – dodaje Gracie J.\r\n\r\n\\9. Spraw, aby pielęgnacja manicure stała się codziennością.\r\n\r\nPo całej ciężkiej pracy kilka dobrych nawyków może przedłużyć żywotność manicure DIY. „Zawsze polecam moim klientom noszenie rękawiczek podczas zmywania naczyń lub sprzątania domu” – mówi Gracie J. „Mówię im również, aby używali olejku do skórek. Pomaga utrzymać zdrową skórę wokół paznokci i promuje zdrowy wzrost paznokci”.\r\n\r\nNarva jest wielką fanką kremów do rąk – dwa z jej ulubionych to Omorovicza i Tatcha. „Oba są super nawilżające, ale nie pozostawiają tłustego wykończenia” – mówi.\r\n\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '/resources/images/woman-doing-her-manicure.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/ways-to-not-ruin-your-at-home-manicure', 0, 0);

Stojąc przed tą wielką ścianą butelek, wybieram klasyczne odcienie, takie jak kapcie baletowe Essie, ale te kolory waty cukrowej nie pasują do mojej mlecznej skóry.

Możesz spróbować lakieru z nutą róży, jeśli szukasz czegoś odpowiedniego do pracy, lub szarego odcienia, jeśli chcesz, aby było to trochę bardziej ekscytujące.\r\n\r\n![Image may contain Cosmetics](/resources/images/3_nude.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Podobne odcienie:** Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nail Polish w Totem-ly Yours; Lakier do paznokci Dior Vernis w kolorze incognito; Lakier do paznokci OPI na Islandii Butelka OPI\r\n\r\nDla głębokiej skóry:\r\n\r\n![Image may contain Hand Human Person and Finger](/resources/images/062917_SELF45055.jpg)\r\n\r\nJasne, mętne kolory mogą sprawić, że paznokcie będą wyglądać sztucznie na ciemnej skórze.

Alternatywnie wypróbuj Mented Nail Polish w Brown & Bougie lub Zoya Nail Polish w Nyssie\r\n\r\n![Image may contain Cosmetics Bottle and Perfume](/resources/images/4_nude.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Podobne odcienie:** Marc Jacobs Enamored Hi-Shine Nail Lacquer w kolorze Delphine; Lakier do paznokci Zoya w Debbie; Essie lakier do paznokci w mufkach z norek\r\n\r\nWskazówki dotyczące aplikacji dla idealnych paznokci nude:\r\n\r\nPonieważ lakier do paznokci nude jest o wiele mniej wybaczający niż odważna czerwień lub ciemna jagoda, musisz odpowiednio przygotować paznokieć, aby uzyskać wspaniałe rezultaty. „W przypadku nude zawsze chcesz, aby łożysko paznokcia było czyste” – mówi Saulsbery. „Chcesz, aby każdy kawałek skóry, który mógłbyś odpaść, zanim nałożysz lakier, ponieważ w przypadku nude wszystko się pojawi – nawet kawałek kłaczków”. Najpierw użyj zmiękczacza do skórek, takiego jak Intensywny balsam do naprawy skórek Qtica (18 USD).\r\nNastępnie delikatnie odsuń skórę wokół podstawy paznokcia. Zamiast wycinać skórki, Saulsbery zaleca użycie bloku polerskiego w celu usunięcia nadmiaru skóry. Następnie ukształtuj końcówkę paznokcia, szczotkując pilnikiem od rogu do środka. Upewnij się, że wszedłeś również pod wolny paznokieć, aby pozbyć się nadmiaru kurzu pod wolną krawędzią, który może uwidocznić się dzięki przezroczystym formułom nude.\r\n\r\nPrzed nałożeniem lakieru bazowego należy odwodnić paznokieć zmywaczem do lakieru i spirytusem, aby pozbyć się ewentualnego oleju. Dzięki temu manicure trwa dłużej. Saulsbery używa Orly Top2Bottom (10 USD) jako bazę i warstwę nawierzchniową. „W przypadku nude chcesz się upewnić, że baza jest całkowicie sucha przed nałożeniem koloru, ponieważ nude może się ciągnąć i będzie się rozmazywał” – mówi. „Później nakładasz warstwę po warstwie, próbując ją przyciemnić, kiedy wszystko, co musisz zrobić, to po prostu poczekać sekundę, aż baza wyschnie”.\r\n\r\nSaulsbery stosuje również specjalną technikę nakładania lakieru: najpierw przesuwaj pędzel po podstawie paznokcia z boku na bok, aby wyrównać kolor w pobliżu naskórka. Następnie przeciągnij kolor od podstawy do końca trzema pociągnięciami. W ten sposób uzyskasz pełne krycie bez plam i smug.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-09 20:33:09', '2021-03-11 13:30:52', '/resources/images/062917_SELF45139.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/nude-nail-polish-skin-tone', 0, 0);

Jedynej opcji, której w dużej mierze brakowało? Polski bezpieczny dla muzułmańskiej modlitwy, uniemożliwiający muzułmańskim kobietom, które przestrzegają wytycznych halal (zasady dotyczące tego, co jest, a co nie jest dozwolone w niektórych interpretacjach prawa islamskiego), przed wejściem do gry w gwoździe.

To wystarczający powód, aby uczcić kolekcję, ale nawet jeśli nie szukasz lakieru halal-OK, warto przyjrzeć się tej gamie. Według Tal Pink, cyfrowego dyrektora Orly, przepuszczalność lakieru zapewnia również trwalsze manicure – a biorąc pod uwagę winogronowe, wiśniowe, białe, metaliczne odcienie szarości i beżu (oraz szklistą warstwę nawierzchniową), nie widzimy powodu je zdjąć.\r\n\r\n![Image may contain Face Human Person and Rahama Sadau](/resources/images/mgirl2_1024x.jpg)\r\n\r\nŻadna linia lakierów do paznokci nie byłaby kompletna bez własnego zestawu niesamowicie śmiesznych imion, a ta nowa współpraca nie jest wyjątkiem. „Wiele z nas to dziewczyny, które nigdy nie mogły znaleźć swoich nazwisk na breloczku, więc chcieliśmy mieć pewność, że dzięki tej kolekcji zapewnimy to doświadczenie” — powiedziała założycielka MuslimGirl.com, Amani Al-Khatahtbeh.

Badanie opublikowane w Journal of the National Cancer Institute wykazało, że ryzyko czerniaka zmniejsza się wraz ze spożyciem kawy i że ryzyko to zmniejsza się z każdą wypijaną filiżanką. *Link do badania*.\r\n8. **Nowe wytyczne dietetyczne USDA 2015 zalecają go dla lepszego zdrowia**. Doradzają ludziom, że wypijanie od 3 do 5 filiżanek kawy dziennie jest dobre dla ich ogólnego stanu zdrowia i zmniejsza ryzyko chorób. Jednak twierdzą, że dodanie cukru, śmietanki lub śmietanki smakowej szybko neguje potencjalne korzyści. Pełny raport tutaj.(pdf)\r\n\r\n9. **Zmniejszenie ryzyka zgonu na zawał serca**. Naukowcy odkryli, że ci, którzy piją dwie lub więcej filiżanek kawy dziennie po zawale serca, mają najmniejsze ryzyko śmierci na atak serca. Badania.\r\n10. **Pomaga ludziom lepiej dogadać się ze współpracownikami.** Badanie opublikowane w Journal of Psychopharmacology wykazało, że pracownicy/miejsca pracy spożywające kawę mają bardziej pozytywny obraz siebie i innych niż pracownicy/miejsca pracy, które nie konsumują Kawa. Spożywanie kawy zwiększyło również udział w zajęciach grupowych w miejscu pracy.\r\n\r\n## Przeciwutleniacze promujące zdrowie kawy\r\n\r\nJagody Kawowe\r\n\r\nProzdrowotne właściwości kawy są prawdopodobnie spowodowane przeciwutleniaczami naturalnie występującymi w ziarnie kawy.\r\n\r\n- Typowa porcja kawy zawiera **więcej przeciwutleniaczy** niż typowa porcja** soku winogronowego, jagód, malin i pomarańczy.\r\n- Przeciwutleniacze zawarte w kawie mogą tłumić stany zapalne, zmniejszając ryzyko związanych z nimi zaburzeń, takich jak choroby układu krążenia.\r\n- Badanie przeprowadzone na Uniwersytecie Monash jeszcze bardziej wykazało właściwości przeciwutleniające parzonej kawy.\r\n\r\n**W takim razie po prostu pij kawę bezkofeinową?**\r\n\r\nChociaż nadal istnieją pewne korzyści zdrowotne wynikające z picia kawy bezkofeinowej, większość powyższych badań wykazała, że ​​​​kawa zawierająca kofeinę ma największe korzyści.\r\n\r\nWynika to z usuwania wielu przeciwutleniaczy podczas procesu dekofeinizacji.\r\n\r\n### Jak więc bezpieczna lub korzystna jest kawa?\r\n\r\nDla większości ludzi kawa może być zdrową częścią diety. Dobrze jest cieszyć się kilkoma filiżankami dziennie, chyba że nie możesz kontrolować spożycia.\r\n\r\nJednak kawa może nie być korzystna dla wszystkich. Osoby z pewnymi chorobami serca, wrażliwością na kofeinę i kobiety w ciąży powinny trzymać się kawy bezkofeinowej lub herbaty. \r\n\r\nPonadto ci, którzy piją kawę w nadmiarze, mogą negować niektóre korzyści ze względu na duże ilości kofeiny, które spożywają. Osoby te mogą skorzystać z detoksu kofeinowego, aby zresetować swoją tolerancję na kofeinę do bardziej umiarkowanych poziomów.\r\n\r\nKluczem jest umiar, który zwykle wynosi 2-3 filiżanki dziennie, aby uzyskać korzyści zdrowotne kawy, ale uniknąć negatywnych problemów związanych ze zbyt dużą ilością kofeiny.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-11 16:49:49', '2021-03-11 16:49:50', '/resources/images/Reasons-to-drink-coffee-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/7-good-reasons-to-drink-coffee.html', 1, 0);

Ich oferta *Miliarderów* jest dość szalona, ​​podobnie jak niektóre z ich standardowych ofert na ciepło i zimno.\r\n\r\n### Jak obniżyć poziom kalorii w napoju kawowym\r\n\r\nByć może jako okazjonalna uczta te napoje są dopuszczalne, ale dla tych, którzy sięgają po nie regularnie lub codziennie, aby uzyskać kofeinę, prawdopodobnie nie wyświadczasz swojemu ciału ani talii.\r\n\r\nJeśli masz nadwagę i próbujesz zrzucić kilka kilogramów, wyeliminowanie takich napojów kawowych z diety jest świetnym pierwszym krokiem do zmniejszenia ogólnego spożycia kalorii. (Zrozumienie całkowitego dziennego wydatku na energię i śledzenie tego, co jesz przez jakiś czas, jest jeszcze lepsze.\r\n\r\nNajbardziej oczywistym sposobem na zmniejszenie kaloryczności kawy jest po prostu przejście na czarną kawę, jednak łatwiej to powiedzieć niż zrobić. Wielu po prostu nie lubi pić czarnej kawy. Oto kilka wskazówek, jak cieszyć się kremową kawą, ale z mniejszą ilością kalorii.\r\n\r\n1. **Zamawiając napój kawowy, poproś o 2% lub odtłuszczone mleko**. Wiele kawiarni domyślnie używa pełnego mleka.\r\n2. **Używaj mleka bez laktozy:** Laktoza jest cukrem w mleku, ale ludzki język nie smakuje tak słodko. Kiedy firmy sprzedają mleko bez laktozy, po prostu dodają do mleka enzym laktazę, który rozkłada laktozę na prostsze cukry, które język lepiej smakuje. Kiedy używasz mleka bez laktozy, kawa będzie naturalnie słodsza, mimo że zawartość cukru nie uległa zmianie.\r\n3. **Poproś o aromaty i syropy bez cukru.** Te przeszły długą drogę przez lata i wiele z nich świetnie smakuje bez dodawania kalorii.\r\n4. **Unikaj napojów kawowych na bazie lodów.** Są one znacznie bardziej kaloryczne niż napoje z mrożonej kawy, które zawierają kruszony lód.\r\n5. **Nie bój się śmietanki.** Dodanie łyżki śmietanki do zaparzonej 12 fl oz kawy dodaje tylko 52 kalorie, podczas gdy Latte Tall Starbucks to 180 kalorii. Jeśli lubisz kawę kremową, wybierz kawę parzoną lub Americano ze śmietanką zamiast napoju espresso na bazie mleka.\r\n\r\nOprócz negatywnych skutków, jakie wszystkie te kalorie mają na utrzymanie prawidłowej wagi, nadmiar cukru w ​​wielu napojach kawowych jest również zagrożeniem dla zdrowia.\r\n\r\nCoraz więcej badań pokazuje, że spożywanie dużych ilości cukru wiąże się z wszelkiego rodzaju chorobami.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-11 16:52:07', '2021-03-11 16:52:09', '/resources/images/Calorie-Laden-Coffees-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/coffees-with-crazy-calories.html', 1, 0);

Is this true or just marketing hyperbole?', '﻿![the coffee lovers diet by Dr. Bob Arnot](/resources/images/coffee-lovers-diet-Arnott.jpg)\r\n\r\nNiedawno natknęliśmy się na nową książkę zatytułowaną „Dieta miłośników kawy: Zmień swoją kawę, zmień swoje życie” i od razu zaintrygowała nas ta koncepcja.\r\n\r\nAutorem książki jest dr. Bob Arnot, który jest lekarzem i wcześniej był korespondentem medycznym dla sieci telewizyjnych, takich jak NBC i CBS. Jego pomysł na napisanie książki wziął się z jego śledztwa w sprawie Ikarian, którzy są jednymi z najstarszych żyjących ludzi na planecie, oraz kawy, którą zazwyczaj piją.\r\n\r\nPiją kawę inaczej niż większość ludzi na Zachodzie. Ich kawa to grecka kawa, która jest drobno zmielona i gotowana przed podaniem. Uważa się, że to w połączeniu z ich stylem życia i dietą śródziemnomorską jest źródłem ich długowieczności.\r\n\r\n### Zmień kawę, zmień swoje życie?\r\n\r\nDr Arnot uważa, że ​​jeśli ludzie z Zachodu zmienią sposób, w jaki piją kawę, również mogą pomóc w uwolnieniu prawdziwego potencjału kawy w zapewnianiu lepszego zdrowia i długowieczności.\r\n\r\nUważa, że ​​zaczyna się od wyboru odpowiednich ziaren kawy i właściwego palenia. Należy wybierać ziarna o wysokiej zawartości fenolu (o wysokiej zawartości przeciwutleniaczy), które powinny być tylko lekko palone, aby zachować jak najwięcej fenoli.¹\r\n\r\nNastępnym krokiem jest przygotowanie kawy na wzór Greków. Zmiel ziarna prawidłowo, używaj wody o najlepszej temperaturze do ekstrakcji i preferuj metody, które mają dłuższy czas ekstrakcji.\r\n\r\nJednak ludzie powinni unikać cukru lub nabiału w swojej kawie i uważa, że ​​nie przegapią tego, ponieważ kawa o wysokiej zawartości fenolu smakuje znacznie lepiej na czarno niż kawa złej jakości, do której większość ludzi jest przyzwyczajona.\r\n\r\nDr Arnot uważa, że ​​jeśli ludzie zaczną pić kawę w ten sposób, zauważą dramatyczne zmiany w swoim nastroju, poziomie energii i ogólnie lepszym zdrowiu.\r\n\r\n### Jego studia\r\n\r\nWe współpracy z dr Davidem Niemanem z North Carolina Reseach Campus opracowano podwójnie ślepą próbę kontrolowaną placebo w celu sprawdzenia skuteczności kawy o wysokiej zawartości fenolu.\r\n\r\nZgodnie z pierwszym rozdziałem książki, jednej grupie uczestników podawano kawę bezkofeinową o wysokiej zawartości fenolu, a drugiej kawę bezkofeinową o niskiej zawartości fenolu (placebo). Kontynuowali używanie przez 2 tygodnie. Po krótkim okresie wypłukiwania, dwie grupy otrzymywały przeciwną próbkę przez dwa tygodnie.\r\n\r\nTDM uczestników (całkowite zaburzenie nastroju) mierzono następnie przed i 30 minut po podaniu dawki. Ci, którzy spożywali kawę o wysokiej zawartości fenolu z kofeiną, zgłaszali energię, żywotność i bardziej pozytywny nastrój. \r\n\r\n### Dieta\r\n\r\nJeśli chodzi o zalecenia dietetyczne, aby schudnąć, książka jest dość standardowa. Dr Arnot zaczyna od wyjaśnienia, w jaki sposób kawa o wysokiej zawartości fenolu i kofeina ogólnie pomagają w utracie tłuszczu, przyspieszając metabolizm i pomagając organizmowi w wykorzystaniu zgromadzonego tłuszczu na energię.\r\n\r\nOprócz picia wysokiej jakości kawy, zalecana jest dieta bogata w produkty roślinne, a także chude białko. Zalecanych jest wiele zasad diety śródziemnomorskiej. Unikając przetworzonej żywności, dodatku cukru i innych rafinowanych węglowodanów, osoby na diecie naturalnie zmniejszą spożycie kalorii i schudną.\r\n\r\n### Problemy z dietą miłośnika kawy?\r\n\r\nNajbardziej oczywistym problemem związanym z dietą jest jego błędne badanie. Jedna grupa spożywała wysokofenolową kawę z kofeiną, a druga grupa (placebo) spożywała kawę bezkofeinową o niskiej zawartości fenolu. Każdy, kto kiedykolwiek badał metodę naukową, wie, że prawidłowe badanie może jednocześnie testować tylko JEDNĄ zmienną. Jego badanie faktycznie miało DWIE zmienne; kofeina i fenole (CGA).\r\n\r\nPowinien był użyć kawy z kofeiną o wysokiej zawartości fenolu i placebo kawy o niskiej zawartości fenolu z kofeiną jako placebo. Oczywiście ludzie, którzy pili kawę z kofeiną, zgłaszali lepszy nastrój, energię i produktywność, ponieważ to właśnie robi kofeina. Oczywiście grupa bezkofeinowa będzie czuła się kiepsko, zwłaszcza jeśli wcześniej pili kawę z kofeiną…\r\n\r\nDr Arnot sprzedaje własną markę kawy o wysokiej zawartości fenolu (Dr Danger Coffee), więc istnieje potencjalny konflikt interesów. Arnot zgłosił również patent na wysokofenolową metodę parzenia kawy.\r\n\r\nNie twierdzę, że kawa o wysokiej zawartości fenolu jest lepsza dla zdrowia niż kawa o niskiej zawartości fenolu, ponieważ przeciwutleniacze są jednym z kluczowych czynników wpływających na prozdrowotne działanie kawy, ale ludzie zauważyliby te korzyści z biegiem czasu, a nie od razu.\r\n\r\nDr Arnot mówi, że ludzie czują się lepiej zaraz po jego kawie w porównaniu do normalnego napoju kawowego. Problem z tą logiką polega na tym, że kawa w stylu greckim ma również więcej kofeiny na uncję niż kawa parzona na Zachodzie. Więc jeśli ludzie nagle przestawią się z jednego na drugi, poczują różnicę ze względu na poziom kofeiny.\r\n\r\nWarto również zauważyć, że tradycyjnie zarówno grecka, jak i turecka kawa podawana jest z cukrem i może być całkiem słodka. Przypuszczam, że Ikarianie również pili w ten sposób swoją kawę (choć nie mogę tego zweryfikować). \r\n\r\n## Wnioski końcowe\r\n\r\nZdrowe odżywianie i uzyskiwanie większej ilości przeciwutleniaczy dzięki naturalnym produktom, takim jak kawa, ma pozytywny wpływ na umysł, wagę i długowieczność. Ale dieta dr Arnota byłaby trochę bardziej wiarygodna, gdyby nie miał do niej przypisanej własnej marki kawy i gdyby prowadził naukowo uzasadnione badania potwierdzające jego teorię.\r\n\r\nJeśli kochasz kawę, może ona być częścią zdrowej diety, a jeśli nie, książka pokazuje ludziom, jak uzyskać jak najwięcej korzyści zdrowotnych z kawy, zmieniając technikę parzenia, a także wybierając kawy wyższej jakości.\r\n\r\nNie ma również powodu, dla którego dana osoba nie mogłaby w razie potrzeby dodać odrobiny śmietanki i cukru do kawy. Nie zmienia to współczynnika przeciwutleniaczy kawy i zazwyczaj dodaje tylko kilka kalorii. Dla ludzi o wiele ważniejsze jest wyeliminowanie słodkich napojów, takich jak napoje gazowane, a nawet sok owocowy, niż pominięcie łyżeczki cukru i odrobiny śmietanki w kawie.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-11 16:53:04', '2021-03-11 16:53:06', '/resources/images/coffee-lovers-diet-Arnott-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/coffee-lovers-diet.html', 0, 0);

Here\'s how you can prevent this.', '﻿Kofeina jest ceniona, ponieważ zwalcza sen i uczucie zmęczenia, ale może to być miecz obosieczny.\r\n\r\n![sleep and caffeine](/resources/images/cant-sleep.jpg)\r\n\r\nKofeina może w rzeczywistości uniemożliwić ludziom spokojny sen1, co oznacza, że ​​następnego ranka potrzeba jeszcze więcej kofeiny, aby czuć się dobrze.\r\n\r\n**Może to stać się błędnym kołem, jeśli użytkownik kofeiny nie jest ostrożny.**\r\n\r\n*Oto jak możesz mieć pewność, że nie pozwolisz, aby kofeina pozbawiła Cię Twojego cennego snu.*\r\n\r\n## Jak kofeina zapobiega zasypianiu\r\n\r\nKofeina przede wszystkim zapobiega zasypianiu poprzez blokowanie receptorów adenozynowych w mózgu. Zasadniczo adenozyna jest neuroprzekaźnikiem, który sygnalizuje mózgowi, że ciało jest zmęczone i potrzebuje odpoczynku.\r\n\r\nKofeina dobrze wpasowuje się w te receptory i uniemożliwia adenozynie wykonywanie swojej pracy. Dopóki istnieje stały dopływ kofeiny do receptorów, sen będzie utrudniony.\r\n\r\nNiektórzy mogą nadal zasypiać, mimo że kofeina nadal blokuje receptory adenozyny, ale sen ten jest zwykle płytki i niespokojny.\r\n\r\n### Kofeina zakłóca rytm dobowy\r\n\r\nKofeina nie tylko blokuje receptory adenozyny, ale jeśli jest spożywana zbyt przed snem, może zaburzyć cały rytm dobowy.\r\n\r\nNaukowcy z Laboratorium Biologii Molekularnej MRC7 w Wielkiej Brytanii odkryli, że gdy uczestnicy badania otrzymywali 200 mg kofeiny 3 godziny przed snem, kofeina opóźniała ich normalny rytm snu o 40 minut. Uczestnicy, którzy również byli wystawieni na jasne światło wraz z kofeiną, mieli opóźniony cykl snu o 105 minut.\r\n\r\n**Wpływa to nie tylko na to, jak dobrze zasypiasz, ale także na to, jak dobrze się czujesz następnego ranka.** ### Dlaczego sen jest ważny\r\n\r\nDla ludzi sen jest koniecznością.2 Sen jest wtedy, gdy zachodzi większość procesów naprawy i odmładzania organizmu. Dorośli powinni spać 7-8 godzin w nocy, a dzieci, które wciąż się rozwijają, powinny spać ponad 9 godzin każdej nocy.\r\n\r\nW rzeczywistości jednym z głównych powodów, dla których nie zaleca się spożywania nadmiernej ilości kofeiny u dzieci, jest to, że sen jest tak ważny dla prawidłowego rozwoju mózgu, a kofeina może wpływać na długość i jakość snu, jakiego potrzebuje dziecko.3\r\n\r\nBrak dobrej jakości snu jest również powiązany z otyłością, chorobami psychicznymi, wysokim ciśnieniem krwi i stresem.4 Dlatego bardzo ważne jest, abyś dużo odpoczywał, jeśli chcesz być w jak najlepszym zdrowiu.\r\n\r\n![sen i dobre zdrowie](/resources/images/healthy-sleep.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Jak powstrzymać kofeinę przed kradzieżą snu\r\n\r\nNiestety, kofeina i brak snu zbyt często tworzą błędne koło. Ludzie często spożywają kofeinę, ponieważ nie mają wystarczającej ilości snu, a kofeina uniemożliwia im uzyskanie takiej ilości i jakości snu, jakiej potrzebują, aby czuć się obudzonym i pobudzonym.\r\n\r\n>Active Edge opracował koszulkę do spania, która wykorzystuje technologię o niskiej częstotliwości fal, aby poprawić jakość snu. Może to być również coś do wypróbowania, jeśli kofeina wpływa na jakość snu.\r\n\r\nIstnieje jednak kilka kroków, które możesz podjąć, aby przerwać cykl i nadal dobrze wysypiać się podczas używania kofeiny. Naprawdę intensywni użytkownicy kofeiny mogą odnieść korzyści z detoksykacji kofeiny przed tymi krokami, aby zresetować swoją tolerancję na kofeinę.\r\n\r\n**Po pierwsze, nie spożywaj kofeiny zbyt późno po południu.**5 Jeśli chcesz iść spać o 10, prawdopodobnie powinieneś unikać kofeiny po 12 w południe. Jeśli w południe spożyłeś 200 mg kofeiny, w oparciu o okres półtrwania kofeiny wynoszący 5,7 godziny, nadal miałbyś ponad 50 mg w swoim systemie o 22:00.\r\n\r\nPonadto nie uwzględnia to żadnej kofeiny spożytej wcześniej w ciągu dnia, która również jest nadal przetwarzana. Jeśli masz wysoką wrażliwość lub niską tolerancję na kofeinę, być może będziesz musiał przerwać jej spożycie jeszcze wcześniej.\r\n\r\n**Po drugie, poznaj swoją osobistą bezpieczną dzienną dawkę kofeiny i unikaj jej więcej.** Możesz to znaleźć za pomocą naszego kalkulatora kofeiny, ale dla większości ludzi wynosi ona od 300-400 mg dziennie. Bezsenność jest jednym z głównych objawów przedawkowania kofeiny i może uniemożliwić zasypianie, którego potrzebujesz.\r\n\r\n**Na koniec nie spożywaj kofeiny zaraz po przebudzeniu.** Badania pokazują6, że kofeina działa najlepiej, gdy jest przyjmowana 1-2 godziny po przebudzeniu. Kiedy budzimy się po raz pierwszy, nasze ciała znajdują się w naturalnym stanie przebudzenia.\r\n\r\nJeśli poczekasz i spożyjesz kofeinę po tym, jak ten stan przebudzenia minie, będzie to znacznie bardziej skuteczne w pomaganiu ci czuć się czujnym i produktywnym. Dodatkowo pomoże ci to powstrzymać się od spożywania zbyt dużej ilości kofeiny, która zakłócałaby sen następnej nocy.\r\n\r\n![zmęczony](/resources/images/4896025102_1fb83becf3_o.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Oznaki, że kofeina uniemożliwia sen\r\n\r\nJeśli nie śpisz dobrze i nie masz pewności, czy kofeina przeszkadza w twoim śnie, oto kilka rzeczy, na które należy zwrócić uwagę.\r\n\r\n1. Czy masz problemy z zasypianiem?\r\n2. Czy zasypiasz, ale budzisz się wkrótce potem?\r\n3. Czy śpisz, ale często budzisz się w nocy?\r\n4. Czy dużo się rzucasz i obracasz podczas snu?\r\n5. Czy często używasz tabletek nasennych, aby zasnąć?\r\n\r\nTo wszystko może wskazywać, że kofeina wciąż obecna w twoim systemie uniemożliwia prawidłowe spanie.

Nowsze badanie wykazało, że pacjenci z rakiem okrężnicy, którzy pili cztery lub więcej porcji kawy dziennie, byli o 42% mniej narażeni na nawrót raka jelita grubego po operacji i leczeniu. To badanie zostało przeprowadzone przez Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Jeszcze nowsze badanie poparło również poprzednie badania dotyczące zmniejszonego ryzyka raka jelita grubego wśród osób pijących kawę.\r\n6. **Rak piersi:**Co najmniej 3 filiżanki kawy dziennie mogą zapobiec lub opóźnić wystąpienie niektórych rodzajów raka piersi. Inne badanie wykazało, że co najmniej 2 filiżanki kawy wypite razem z lekiem na raka piersi, tamoksyfenem, spowodowały o 49% mniej wczesnych nawrotów raka piersi wśród chorych na raka piersi w Szwecji.\r\n7. **Rak wątroby:**Pijący kawę mają o 41% mniej przypadków raka wątroby. Nowsze badanie wykazało, że 1-3 filiżanki kawy dziennie zmniejszają ryzyko zachorowania na raka wątrobowokomórkowego o 29%.Link\r\n8. **Rak endometrium**: Kobiety, które wypijają co najmniej 3 filiżanki kawy dziennie, mają o 19% mniejsze ryzyko zachorowania na raka endometrium, który każdego roku pochłania życie około 10 000 kobiet w USA. Badania.\r\n9. **Kofeina chroni przed rakiem płuc**. Nowe badanie opublikowane w czasopiśmie Experimental Hematology & Oncology wykazało, że kofeina hamuje kilka białek znajdujących się w komórkach raka płuc, co z kolei zapobiega wzrostowi i reprodukcji komórki.\r\n10. **Rak skóry**: Niedawne badanie opublikowane w The Journal of the National Cancer Institute wykazało, że osoby pijące kawę z kofeiną rzadziej zachorują na czerniaka. Im więcej osób spożywało kawę, tym mniejsze ryzyko zaobserwowano. Streszczenie badania. ### Kawa z kofeiną jako część zdrowej diety\r\n\r\nChociaż badania dotyczące kawy/raku nie są ostateczne, ujawniają, że picie kawy jest prawdopodobnie znacznie bardziej korzystne niż szkodliwe, o ile osoba może prawidłowo metabolizować kofeinę i nie cierpi na alergię na kofeinę lub jej nadmierne spożycie.\r\n\r\nW większości badań stwierdzono, że kawa bezkofeinowa nie wydaje się mieć takiego samego efektu, co prawdopodobnie wynika z procesu usuwania kofeiny, który usuwa wiele przeciwutleniaczy.\r\n\r\nPodejrzewamy jednak, że ludzie, którzy jedzą kiepskiej jakości żywność i angażują się w niezdrowe nawyki, takie jak palenie i nadmierne picie, prawdopodobnie nie doświadczą właściwości zwalczających raka, jakie ma do zaoferowania kawa.\r\n\r\nJednak kawa jako część zdrowej diety bogatej w świeże warzywa i owoce najprawdopodobniej przyniesie największe korzyści przeciwnowotworowe.\r\n\r\nLudzie powinni również pamiętać, że ze względu na kofeinę w kawie, zaleca się również umiar, a mniej niż 400 mg kofeiny ze wszystkich źródeł dziennie wydaje się być bezpiecznym poziomem dla większości zdrowych osób dorosłych.\r\n\r\nŚwiatowa Organizacja Zdrowia niedawno usunęła kawę z listy możliwych czynników rakotwórczych. Przytaczali, że istnieje przytłaczająca ilość badań, że kawa może promować zdrowie i faktycznie hamować raka. Zauważyli jednak, że picie kawy w temperaturach przekraczających 140 stopni Fahrenheita może zwiększać ryzyko raka gardła i przełyku. Ta temperatura jest znacznie wyższa niż zwykle spożywana kawa.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-11 17:21:00', '2021-03-11 17:21:02', '/resources/images/coffee-prevents-cancer.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/caffeinated-coffee-the-anti-cancer-wonder-drug.html', 0, 0);

Zatem kawa musi je odwadniać **-albo-**, prawda?\r\n\r\n### Kofeina jako środek moczopędny\r\n\r\nKofeina może wywoływać dodatkowe wydzielanie wody przez nerki lub innymi słowy działa adiuretycznie, co z definicji oznacza „*coś, co sprzyja tworzeniu moczu przez nerki*”.\r\n\r\nJednak ostatnie badanie 1 wykazało, że tylko dawki 360 mg kofeiny lub większe wytwarzały znacznie większą objętość moczu.\r\n\r\nW innym badaniu 2 zauważono, że zwiększona tolerancja na kofeinę również wpływa na to, jak dobrze kofeina działa jako środek moczopędny. U **osób bez wykształconej tolerancji na kofeinę działanie moczopędne kofeiny było bardziej widoczne**.\r\n\r\nJeszcze inne badanie 3 wykazało, że spożywanie kofeiny przed wysiłkiem fizycznym negowało działanie moczopędne kofeiny w porównaniu ze spożywaniem kofeiny, a następnie odpoczynkiem.\r\n\r\nWręcz przeciwnie, badanie 4 dotyczyło spożycia napojów energetyzujących oraz wpływu kofeiny i/lub innych składników napojów energetyzujących, takich jak tauryna, na odwodnienie. Odkryli, że grupa testowa, która otrzymywała napoje energetyczne zawierające kofeinę, miała znacznie więcej wydalanego moczu niż osoby, które nie otrzymywały kofeiny lub tylko napoje zawierające tylko taurynę. Osoby te były już w stanie odwodnienia.\r\n\r\nW związku z tym, na podstawie badań, kofeina jest lekiem moczopędnym, ale **niezbyt skutecznym**, ponieważ istnieje kilka czynników, które decydują o tym, jak dobrze działa w tym zakresie.\r\n\r\n![dehydration](/resources/images/dehydration.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Czy kofeina odwadnia się?\r\n\r\n**Więc pozostaje pytanie, czy kofeina odwadnia człowieka, czy nie?**\r\n\r\nJeśli spożyto 400 mg kofeiny (jako pigułki z kofeiną lub zastrzyk energii) *bez* picia innych płynów razem z dawką, wtedy może wystąpić ogólny efekt odwodnienia (o ile osoba nie toleruje nadmiernie kofeiny).\r\n\r\nJednak większość ludzi spożywa kofeinę w postaci kawy, herbaty, napojów energetycznych lub napojów gazowanych, więc co w takich przypadkach?\r\n\r\nWspomniane powyżej badanie 4 dotyczyło spożycia napojów energetycznych oraz wpływu kofeiny i/lub innych składników napojów energetycznych, takich jak tauryna, na odwodnienie. Odkryli, że napoje energetyczne z dodatkiem kofeiny dodatkowo odwadniały już odwodnione osoby testowe, ale nie było dostosowania do tolerancji osoby na kofeinę.\r\n\r\nW innym badaniu 5 przyglądano się wszystkim rodzajom napojów, takich jak kawa, herbata, napoje gazowane, soki, woda itp. i stwierdzono, że „*nie ma znaczących różnic we wpływie różnych kombinacji napojów na stan nawodnienia zdrowych dorosłych mężczyzn. Doradzanie ludziom, aby pomijali napoje zawierające kofeinę jako część dziennego spożycia płynów, nie jest poparte wynikami tego badania*”.\r\n\r\nNowsze badanie (2014) 6 wykazało, że **nie ma znaczącej różnicy w stanie nawodnienia między przyzwyczajonymi do kofeiny mężczyznami, którzy spożywali kawę z umiarem, a tymi, którzy spożywali tylko wodę**.\r\n\r\n![kawa i oddawanie moczu](/resources/images/stone-dog-194453_1280.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Więc dlaczego kawa sprawia, że ​​muszę sikać?**\r\n\r\nPrzyczyn może być kilka. Po pierwsze, jeśli jesteś już nawodniony, dodatkowe płyny spowodują zwiększoną produkcję moczu. Tak więc kawa o pojemności 12-16 fl oz (355-500 ml) wytworzy mniej więcej taką samą ilość wydalanego moczu.\r\n\r\nPo drugie, jeśli nie jesteś regularnym konsumentem kawy lub kofeiny, duże ilości kofeiny mają działanie moczopędne lub odwadniające, zwiększając w ten sposób objętość moczu.\r\n\r\nWreszcie kofeina może powodować nietrzymanie moczu u niektórych mężczyzn i kobiet. Powoduje to potrzebę oddania moczu, nawet jeśli pęcherz nie jest jeszcze pełny. 7,8\r\n\r\n### Podsumowanie\r\n\r\nJeśli regularnie spożywasz napoje zawierające kofeinę, nie musisz martwić się odwodnieniem, o ile ogólnie spożywasz odpowiednią ilość płynów.\r\n\r\nW tym badaniu 9 przeanalizowano wszystkie ważne badania dotyczące kofeiny i odwodnienia sprzed 2003 r.\r\n\r\n**Oto, co doszli do wniosku:**\r\n\r\n> *Najbardziej uzasadnione ekologicznie z opublikowanych badań nie potwierdza sugestii, że spożywanie napojów zawierających kofeinę w ramach normalnego stylu życia prowadzi do nadmiernej utraty płynów w stosunku do przyjętej objętości lub wiąże się ze słabym stanem nawodnienia. Dlatego wydaje się, że nie ma jasnych podstaw do powstrzymywania się od napojów zawierających kofeinę w sytuacjach, w których równowaga płynów może być zagrożona*.\r\n\r\n**Dlatego kawa czy herbata, a nawet napoje bezalkoholowe i napoje energetyzujące mogą być używane jako sposób na nawodnienie organizmu i nie odwodnienie.**\r\n\r\nJednak konsumenci powinni pamiętać o codziennych bezpiecznych ilościach kofeiny, poziomie spożycia cukru i korzyściach zdrowotnych płynących z picia dużej ilości czystej wody.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-11 17:22:18', '2021-03-11 17:22:20', '/resources/images/dehydration-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/caffeine-and-dehydration.html', 0, 0);

Przerwij uzależnienie\r\n\r\nU większości ludzi kofeina jest do pewnego stopnia substancją uzależniającą, chociaż niektórzy opisaliby ją jako *bardzo uzależniającą*.\r\n\r\nW zależności od substancji, która ma normalnie funkcjonować lub nawet nie zasnąć, może stać się błędnym kołem. Zmienia chemię naszego mózgu, powodując potrzebę większej ilości substancji, aby osiągnąć pożądane rezultaty.\r\n\r\n*Rezygnacja z kofeiny lub kawy przerywa cykl i uwalnia nas od konieczności codziennego przyjmowania leku do normalnego funkcjonowania.*\r\n\r\n### 2. Oszczędności finansowe\r\n\r\nKoszt uzależnienia od kofeiny może się sumować i tysiące dolarów rocznie można zaoszczędzić, jeśli zrezygnujesz.\r\n\r\n-Grande Starbucks Latte: 3,65 USD dziennie | 26 USD tygodniowo | **1332 USD rocznie**\r\n- Monster Energy Drink: 3 USD dziennie | 21 USD tygodniowo | **1095 USD rocznie**\r\n- Kawa parzona w domu: 0,71 USD dziennie | 5 USD za tydzień | **259 USD rocznie**\r\n-K-kubki: 0,65 USD dziennie | 4,55 USD tygodniowo | **237 USD rocznie**\r\n-5 godzin energii: 3 USD dziennie | 21 USD tygodniowo | **1095 USD rocznie**\r\n\r\n*Lendingtree.com posiada pomocny kalkulator, który pokazuje dokładnie, ile wydajesz na wybrany napój.*\r\n\r\nPowyżej wymieniliśmy średni koszt jednego napoju dziennie, teraz pomnóż go przez liczbę, którą masz każdego dnia i szybko się sumuje.\r\n\r\n### 3.

Lepszy sen\r\n\r\nKofeina może znacznie zmniejszyć ilość i jakość snu.2 Picie kawy lub napojów energetycznych zbyt późno w ciągu dnia może przeszkadzać w zaśnięciu, ponieważ okres półtrwania kofeiny wynosi 4-6 godzin.\r\n\r\nNawet osoby, które nie mają kofeiny po godzinie 12, zgłaszają lepszą jakość snu po odstawieniu kofeiny.\r\n\r\n### 5. Lepszy nastrój\r\n\r\nKofeina zmienia nastrój. Wielu twierdzi, że jest zrzędliwy, dopóki nie wypiją porannej kawy, a inni czują się ospali, gdy po południu kofeina zaczyna zanikać.\r\n\r\n*Rzucenie palenia może wyrównać wzloty i upadki.*\r\n\r\n### 6. Zmniejszony niepokój\r\n\r\nWiele osób twierdzi, że kofeina zwiększa ich poziom lęku. Ma to związek z tym, jak kofeina stymuluje nadnercza.3\r\n\r\nRezygnacja z kawy lub kofeiny może sprawić, że poczujesz się mniej niespokojny, zwłaszcza jeśli masz skłonność do problemów lękowych.\r\n\r\n### 7. Mniej bólów głowy\r\n\r\nKofeina jest głównym wyzwalaczem bólów głowy. Wszelkie zmiany w normalnym dziennym spożyciu kofeiny mogą powodować ból głowy związany z odstawieniem kofeiny.\r\n\r\nKofeina może być również wyzwalaczem migreny.\r\n\r\n### 8. Wygoda\r\n\r\n- Wyobraź sobie, że nigdy nie musisz zatrzymywać się w Starbucks w drodze do pracy?\r\n- Wyobraź sobie, że nigdy nie musisz zatrzymywać się w sklepie spożywczym po Red Bulla?\r\n- Wyobraź sobie wymazanie robienia kawy z porannej rutyny?\r\n- Wyobraź sobie podróż z plecakiem bez pakowania pigułek z kofeiną lub dodatkowego sprzętu do parzenia kawy?\r\n\r\nUzależnienie od kawy, napojów energetycznych lub napojów gazowanych powoduje niedogodności w naszym życiu, ponieważ potrzebujemy tego narkotyku do działania.\r\n\r\n![bathrooms](/resources/images/6242264195_cd717bc643_o.jpg)\r\n\r\n### 9. Mniej wycieczek do łazienki\r\n\r\nNapoje zawierające kofeinę powodują częstsze oddawanie moczu, a u niektórych osób nawet nietrzymanie moczu.\r\n\r\nKofeina stymuluje również mięśnie gładkie okrężnicy, co powoduje ich skurcz.\r\n\r\n*Może to stanowić wyzwanie podczas spotkań, wycieczek drogowych lub gdy łazienki nie są wygodne.*\r\n\r\nRzucenie palenia może zmniejszyć potrzebę korzystania z łazienki tak często, zwłaszcza rano.\r\n\r\n### 10. Zdrowsze zęby\r\n\r\nKawa i herbata przebarwiają zęby oraz kwaśne i słodkie napoje energetyczne lub napoje gazowane niszczą szkliwo i mogą powodować próchnicę.\r\n\r\nWyeliminowanie tych napojów skutkuje bielszymi i zdrowszymi zębami.\r\n\r\n### 11. Utrata wagi\r\n\r\nChyba że pijesz czarną kawę. Napoje zawierające kofeinę zazwyczaj dodają do naszej diety puste kalorie, których tak naprawdę nie potrzebujemy.\r\n\r\nWielu ekspertów twierdzi, że napoje słodzone są ogromnym składnikiem epidemii otyłości nękającej zachodni świat4\r\n\r\nBadanie przeprowadzone na Victoria University wykazało, że kofeina zawarta w słodkim napoju powoduje, że ludzie spożywają więcej tego słodkiego napoju w porównaniu z słodkim napojem bez kofeiny.\r\n\r\n- Rzucenie tylko jednego Monster Energy Drink dziennie pozwala zaoszczędzić 200 kalorii dziennie, 1400 kalorii tygodniowo lub **73 000 kalorii rocznie**!\r\n- Rezygnacja z 1 Starbucks Vanilla Latte dziennie pozwala zaoszczędzić 250 kalorii dziennie, 1750 kalorii tygodniowo lub **91 250 kalorii rocznie**!\r\n- Rezygnacja z 16 fl.oz. Przyzwyczajenie do coli dziennie pozwala zaoszczędzić 239 kalorii dziennie, 1673 kalorie tygodniowo lub **87 235 kalorii rocznie**!\r\n\r\n1 funt tłuszczu zawiera równowartość 3500 kalorii, więc matematyka…\r\n\r\n### 12. Zdrowa dieta\r\n\r\nKawy butelkowane, herbaty, napoje energetyzujące i napoje gazowane często zawierają asortyment konserwantów, które mają zapewnić im dłuższy okres przydatności do spożycia.\r\n\r\nTe konserwanty mogą mieć negatywny wpływ na zdrowie, a niektóre są nawet zakazane przez inne kraje.\r\n\r\nBezcukrowe napoje energetyczne i napoje gazowane zawierają sztuczne słodziki, które również mogą negatywnie wpływać na Twoje zdrowie.\r\n\r\nWyeliminowanie ich z diety może być korzystne dla ogólnego, długoterminowego dobrego stanu zdrowia.\r\n\r\n![waste and litter](/resources/images/8874662530_cdd866802e_k.jpg)\r\n\r\n### 13. Czystsze środowisko\r\n\r\nUzależnienie od kofeiny stanowi ogromne obciążenie dla naszych zasobów naturalnych. Pomyśl o liczbie plastikowych butelek, puszek i kubków, które trzeba wyprodukować, aby zaspokoić popyt.\r\n\r\n> „*Amerykanie wyrzucają około 33,6 miliona ton plastiku każdego roku, ale tylko 6,5 procent z nich jest poddawane recyklingowi, a 7,7 procent spalane w zakładach przetwarzania odpadów na energię, które wytwarzają energię elektryczną lub ciepło ze śmieci. Reszta ląduje na wysypiskach, gdzie rozkład może zająć nawet 1000 lat.*”. –Stan Planety\r\n\r\nPonadto kofeina pojawia się w miejskich wodociągach z powodu wszystkich wyrzucanych fusów po kawie.\r\n\r\n*Rezygnacja z kofeiny zmniejsza wpływ na środowisko.*\r\n\r\n### 14. Kofeina znów zadziała\r\n\r\nCodzienne spożywanie kofeiny powoduje, że organizm ludzki szybko buduje tolerancję. Ta sama dawka kofeiny powoduje, że osoba osiąga poczucie normalności, a nie euforii, jak kiedyś.\r\n\r\nRzucanie palenia resetuje tolerancję na kofeinę w organizmie, dzięki czemu działa naprawdę dobrze w sytuacjach, w których naprawdę tego potrzebujesz.\r\n\r\n### 15. Możliwe interakcje leków\r\n\r\nKofeina może wchodzić w interakcje z innymi lekami, powodując, że nie działają tak, jak powinny.\r\n\r\n*Rezygnacja z kofeiny eliminuje to ryzyko.*\r\n\r\n![heart-arrhythmia caffeine safety](/resources/images/heart-arrhythmia.jpg)\r\n\r\n### 16. Koniec z drżeniem\r\n\r\nJednym z głównych skutków ubocznych spożywania kofeiny lub kawy jest drżenie lub drżenie rąk. Dla niektórych osób może to być denerwujące, a nawet osłabiające.\r\n\r\n*Rezygnacja może przywrócić ci pewne ręce.*\r\n\r\n### 17. Mniejsze ryzyko zdarzeń sercowych\r\n\r\nKofeina stymuluje mięsień sercowy, powodując jego bicie z silniejszymi skurczami.\r\n\r\nChociaż nie stanowi to problemu dla większości ludzi, osoby z podstawowymi chorobami serca mogą być zagrożone. Ludzie mogą nie zdawać sobie sprawy, że mają nawet chorobę serca, dopóki nie zaczną spożywać kofeiny i nie nastąpią szkody.\r\n\r\n### 18. Zwiększona produktywność\r\n\r\n**Co byś zrobił z dodatkową godziną każdego dnia?** Osoby uzależnione od kofeiny mogą łatwo zmarnować godzinę stojąc w kolejce do kawiarni, robiąc wycieczki do pokoju socjalnego, rozmawiając po drodze ze współpracownikami i zatrzymując się w sklepach ogólnospożywczych .\r\n\r\n*Zaoszczędzony czas można wykorzystać na dodatkową godzinę snu!*\r\n\r\n### 19. Zmniejszone ryzyko cukrzycy typu 2\r\n\r\nChociaż wykazano, że czarna kawa zmniejsza ryzyko cukrzycy, picie słodkiej kawy i napojów zawierających kofeinę w rzeczywistości zwiększa ryzyko zachorowania na cukrzycę.\r\n\r\n> „* Osoby, które regularnie spożywają słodkie napoje – od 1 do 2 puszek dziennie lub więcej – mają o 26% większe ryzyko zachorowania na cukrzycę typu 2*” – Harvard School of Public Health6\r\n\r\n### 20. Lepsze zdrowie\r\n\r\nWiele badań naukowych wskazuje na korzyści zdrowotne kawy i herbaty ze względu na ich właściwości przeciwutleniające. Jednak nie dotyczy to wszystkich napojów zawierających kofeinę.\r\n\r\nSoda, napoje energetyczne oraz przetworzona kawa i herbata najprawdopodobniej mają negatywny wpływ na Twoje zdrowie w dłuższej perspektywie.\r\n\r\nOsoby pijące głównie wodę zgłaszają więcej naturalnej energii, lepsze ogólne samopoczucie, lepszy sen i zdrowszą skórę.\r\n\r\n## Czy powinieneś zrezygnować?\r\n\r\nJeśli jesteś niewolnikiem swojego kubka do kawy lub napoju energetycznego, to już znasz odpowiedź.

Nie dwumiesięczna fasola z supermarketu. Nie liofilizowany natychmiast. Ale ziarna kawy, które zostały zmielone kilka godzin wcześniej.\r\n\r\nZapach kawy (a raczej jej brak) to jeden z wielu powodów, dla których Starbucks kilka lat temu zmagał się z upadkiem.\r\n\r\n**Według prezesa:**\r\n\r\n> *Zauważył, jak zapach firmowych kanapek śniadaniowych zdominował aromat kawy, a nowe smaki zastąpiły prawdziwą inspirację.*\r\n\r\n## Badania nad aromatem kawy\r\n\r\nCo do tego zapachu – nowe badania wykazały, że sam ZAPACH kawy wystarczy, aby obudzić gromadę pozbawionych snu szczurów.\r\n\r\n> *Nie wiemy, czy te same geny są tłumione u ludzi pozbawionych snu, ani czy czulibyśmy się zmęczeni, gdyby tak było, ale wiele z tych genów ma ludzkie odpowiedniki. Zespół twierdzi, że supresja genów może pomóc wyjaśnić, dlaczego ludzie źle się czują, gdy nie mają wystarczająco dużo snu – a reaktywacja genów może wyjaśniać, dlaczego ludzie kochają zapach kawy.*\r\n\r\nNastępnie zespół ma nadzieję zidentyfikować cząsteczki w aromacie kawy, które wpływają na ekspresję genów. Sugerują pompowanie ich do fabryk, aby pomóc ożywić zmęczonych pracowników, którzy nie mogą popijać kawy podczas obsługi maszyn.\r\n\r\n### Kawa ma bardzo złożony zapach\r\n\r\nNaukowcy do tej pory zidentyfikowali 800 związków w kawie, a wiele z nich jest silnie związanych z zapachem.\r\n\r\n![coffee aroma](/resources/images/coffe-art.jpg)\r\n\r\nKawa to bogate związki nieheterocykliczne, które wpływają na smak i zapach substancji.\r\n\r\nLudzie lubią te zapachy, ponieważ uderzają w wiele receptorów zapachowych.

We outline the results of each study here.', '﻿![coffee-caffeine-diabetes](/resources/images/coffee-caffeine-diabetes.jpg)\r\nPrzeprowadzono szeroko zakrojone badania nad tym, czy spożywanie kawy (kofeiny) jest bezpieczne dla osób z cukrzycą typu 2, a także czy kawa może pomóc w zapobieganiu cukrzycy.\r\n\r\nPrzy stale rosnącej populacji osób cierpiących na cukrzycę typu 2 dobrze jest słyszeć, że diabetyk lub potencjalny diabetyk ma przyjaciela w kawie.\r\n\r\nZdrowa dieta, uboga w cukier i rafinowane węglowodany, jest nadal najważniejszym środkiem dietetycznym w leczeniu lub zmniejszaniu ryzyka cukrzycy. Większość badań pokazuje, że kawa może być częścią diety, która ma na celu zapobieganie, leczenie i/lub odwracanie cukrzycy typu 2.\r\n\r\n## Badania nad cukrzycą typu 2 i kawą\r\n\r\n1. Badanie opublikowane przez American Diabetes Association wykazało, że osoby pijące kawę mają niższy poziom cukru i insuliny. Wydaje się również, że zwykła kawa jest lepsza niż bezkofeinowa, więc kawa może nawet zapobiec wystąpieniu cukrzycy typu 2.15, ale poza tym zdrowym mężczyznom podawano albo kawę bezkofeinową, placebo, albo chemikalia: kwas chlorogenowy i trigonelinę rozpuszczone w wodzie, które to dwa główne przeciwutleniacze zawarte w kawie. Poziom glukozy i insuliny u uczestników był sprawdzany po spożyciu każdego przez cały okres próbny. Jedyną próbką, która wykazała obniżony poziom cukru i insuliny była grupa z kwasem chlorogenowym i roztworem trygoneliny.Src.\r\n2. Inne badanie w dużym stopniu analizowało najnowsze badania dotyczące cukrzycy i spożycia kawy i zostało przeprowadzone przez dr Franka Hu z Harvardu. Jego zespół odkrył, że ryzyko cukrzycy typu II spadło o 9% na każdą wypijaną codziennie filiżankę kawy. Kawa bezkofeinowa zmniejsza ryzyko o 6% na filiżankę.Src.\r\n3. 11-letnie badanie dotyczyło związku ryzyka cukrzycy i kawy u kobiet po menopauzie. Okazało się, że kobiety, które wypiły 6 filiżanek kawy, miały o 22% mniejsze ryzyko zachorowania na cukrzycę typu 2.Src.\r\n4. 18-letnie szwedzkie badanie wykazało również większy stopień zmniejszenia ryzyka wśród kobiet, które codziennie spożywają najwięcej filiżanek kawy. *Szwedzi są jednymi z największych konsumentów kawy na świecie.*Src.\r\n5. „Dziewiętnaście z 22 badań epidemiologicznych wykazało, że długotrwałe spożywanie kawy, zarówno zawierającej kofeinę, jak i bezkofeinowej, może zmniejszyć ryzyko cukrzycy typu 2, ale kilku badaczy ostrzegało, że kofeina zawarta w kawie zawierającej kofeinę może zaburzać metabolizm glukozy” z Diabetes Journals.\r\n6. Nowsze badanie pochodzi z Harvard School of Public Health i wykazało, że ryzyko cukrzycy typu 2 zmniejsza się z każdą wypijaną filiżanką kawy. Ludzie, którzy zwiększyli spożycie kawy o jedną filiżankę, zauważyli 11% mniejsze ryzyko cukrzycy typu 2. Jednak ci, którzy zmniejszyli spożycie kawy o jedną filiżankę, odnotowali 17% wzrost ryzyka.Src.\r\n7. Jeszcze inne badanie przeprowadzone w Danii wykazało, że spożywanie kawy nie zwiększa ryzyka cukrzycy typu 2 ani ryzyka otyłości nawet u najbardziej zagorzałych pijących kawę. W badaniu przeanalizowano 93 000 nawyków związanych z kawą i nie stwierdzono związku między otyłością spożywania kawy a cukrzycą. Badanie.\r\n\r\n### Kawa bezkofeinowa nie tak pomocna\r\n\r\nChociaż kawa z kofeiną wydaje się zapewniać największą ochronę, prawdopodobnie nie jest to spowodowane kofeiną. Kawa jest bogata w przeciwutleniacze.\r\n\r\n![coffee-and-diabetes](/resources/images/coffee-and-diabetes.jpg)\r\n\r\nW procesie dekofeinizacji te przeciwutleniacze są również usuwane do znacznie niższych stężeń wraz z kofeiną.\r\n\r\nTo wyjaśnia, dlaczego nie zaobserwowano tych samych wyników w przypadku próbek bezkofeinowych. Dlatego wydaje się, że najlepiej jest mieć regularną, pełną testowaną kawę, z którą nie ma nic wspólnego, jeśli chcesz doświadczyć mniejszego ryzyka cukrzycy typu 2 lub pomóc w leczeniu tej formy cukrzycy.\r\n\r\n## Kofeina obniża poziom glukozy we krwi podczas ćwiczeń\r\n\r\nNaukowcy odkryli, że kiedy osoby z cukrzycą typu 2 używają kofeiny przed ćwiczeniami, bardziej obniża ona poziom glukozy we krwi.\r\n\r\nUczestnicy badania, którym podawano 1 mg kofeiny na 1 kg masy ciała, mieli średnio o 75 mg/dl wyższy spadek poziomu cukru we krwi w porównaniu z tymi, którzy nie przyjmowali kofeiny.\r\n\r\n**Dobry czy zły?**\r\n\r\nDobrze, jeśli próbujesz naturalnie obniżyć poziom cukru we krwi za pomocą diety i ćwiczeń.\r\n\r\nŹle, jeśli jesteś na insulinie i istnieje ryzyko zbyt niskiego poziomu cukru we krwi.\r\n\r\n### Konkluzja?\r\n\r\nTo dobra wiadomość dla osób pijących kawę lub zagrożonych cukrzycą typu 2. Możesz pić tyle kawy ile chcesz, ale radzimy nauczyć się pić ją czarną, aby doświadczyć pełnych korzyści. Upewnij się również, że nie przekraczasz ustalonego dziennego bezpiecznego poziomu kofeiny.\r\n\r\nDodanie cukru i śmietanki bez wątpienia szybko zmniejsza niektóre ochronne właściwości kawy w przypadku cukrzycy typu 2.\r\n\r\n*Jeśli masz cukrzycę, zawsze skonsultuj się z lekarzem przed wprowadzeniem jakichkolwiek zmian w diecie.*\r\n', 0, '2021-03-11 17:27:57', '2021-03-11 17:27:58', '/resources/images/coffee-caffeine-diabetes-150x150.jpg', 'http://sitesforprofit.com/coffee-and-diabetes.html', 0, 0);

Gotowości i Reagowania na COVID-19 przy Centrum Medycznym Uniwersytetu Maryland (UMMC) i Uniwersytecie Maryland w Baltimore.\r\n\r\nWe wczesnych stadiach infekcji, zanim pojawią się objawy, możliwe jest, że wirus nie zostanie wykryty przez test, według CDC, więc negatywny wynik testu może dawać fałszywe poczucie bezpieczeństwa.\r\n\r\n### Jeśli jesteś zdrowy, ale zmartwiony\r\n\r\nJeśli nie masz objawów, ale martwisz się zachorowaniem, najlepszą radą jest przestrzeganie wskazówek dotyczących dystansu społecznego], często myj ręce przez pełne 20 sekund wodą z mydłem, używaj środków do dezynfekcji rąk, gdy mydło i woda nie są dostępne i unikaj dotykania twarzy. Te środki ostrożności pomogą ci uniknąć zachorowania bardziej niż test, mówi dr Schrank.\r\n\r\n„Pamiętaj też, że około 80 procent przypadków jest łagodnych i ludzie sami wyzdrowieją” – mówi.\r\n\r\nOsoby o wyższym ryzyku – osoby w wieku 70 lat lub starsze, cierpiące na cukrzycę, choroby serca lub przewlekłą obturacyjną chorobę płuc (POChP) – powinny ściśle monitorować swój stan zdrowia i w razie jakichkolwiek obaw kontaktować się z lekarzami pierwszego kontaktu – mówi dr Schrank.\r\n\r\n## Testowanie koronawirusa Drive-Up\r\n\r\nDr Shrank mówi, że miejsca, w których można dojechać samochodem, nadal są dobrym modelem do testowania osób, które otrzymały zalecenie lekarza. Ogranicza ryzyko transmisji do i od innych pacjentów (w porównaniu do przebywania w zatłoczonym gabinecie lekarskim i izbie przyjęć) i zapewnia bezpieczniejszym pracownikom służby zdrowia, jednocześnie umożliwiając im pobranie próbki z nosa lub gardła pacjenta, wykonanie czynności życiowych i obserwację pacjentów pod kątem potencjalnych objawów poważnej choroby.\r\n\r\n„To bardzo zrozumiałe, że odczuwasz niepokój i stres związany z koronawirusem” – mówi dr Schrank. „Ale jeśli w ogóle się martwisz, pamiętaj, że najlepszym sposobem zapobiegania wszelkiego rodzaju infekcjom jest częste mycie rąk, stosowanie środków do dezynfekcji rąk i dystans społeczny”.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-16 17:47:16', '2021-03-16 17:47:18', '/resources/images/virus550.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/diagnosis-symptoms/test', 0, 0);

CDC zaleca używanie maski z tkaniny, którą można stworzyć z tanich materiałów lub artykułów gospodarstwa domowego, takich jak T-shirt.\r\n\r\nIdąc dalej, najważniejszym sposobem ochrony przed wirusem, a także innymi osobami, jest zaszczepienie się na COVID-19, gdy będzie ona dostępna. Jednak ważne jest, aby nadal nosić maskę i ćwiczyć dystans społeczny, nawet po szczepieniu.\r\n\r\nMaski klasy medycznej, takie jak maski chirurgiczne lub maski N-95, muszą być zarezerwowane dla tych, którzy ich najbardziej potrzebują i powinny być noszone wyłącznie przez pracowników służby zdrowia lub osoby udzielające pierwszej pomocy. Dowiedz się więcej o rodzaju maski, która jest dla Ciebie odpowiednia.\r\n\r\nNoszenie domowej maski jest szczególnie ważne w miejscach, w których utrzymanie dystansu 6 stóp lub więcej od innych osób jest trudne, takich jak sklep spożywczy czy apteka.\r\n\r\nJest to również jeden z wielu powodów, dla których ograniczenia systemu medycznego Uniwersytetu Maryland dla odwiedzających wymagają od każdej osoby wchodzącej do szpitala lub gabinetu lekarskiego noszenia maski na twarz przez cały czas.\r\n\r\n## Co robią osłony twarzy\r\n\r\nNowatorski koronawirus infekuje innych poprzez kropelki. Te kropelki mogą być wyrzucane w powietrze, gdy ktoś mówi, kaszle lub kicha. Ryzyko przeniesienia koronawirusa przez te kropelki jest wyższe, gdy ludzie znajdują się blisko siebie.\r\n\r\nMaski materiałowe zawierają te kropelki i zapobiegają ich wyrzucaniu w powietrze, zmniejszając prawdopodobieństwo przeniesienia. Jest to szczególnie ważne, gdy trudno jest przestrzegać normalnych środków dystansowania społecznego, takich jak kupowanie artykułów spożywczych lub leków w aptece.\r\n\r\nMaski zapobiegają głównie nieświadomemu rozprzestrzenianiu się choroby na inne osoby, ale niektóre badania wskazują, że mogą pomóc chronić Cię przed dużymi kroplami i służyć jako pośrednie przypomnienie, aby unikać dotykania twarzy.\r\n\r\nDomowe maski nie zastępują środków dystansu społecznego. Nadal powinieneś robić wszystko, co możesz, aby zapobiec zakażeniu koronawirusem, w tym unikać bliskiego kontaktu z innymi ludźmi i często myć ręce.\r\n\r\n## Po co nosić maskę z materiału?\r\n\r\nMaski na twarz są niezbędne, aby chronić innych przed nowym koronawirusem.\r\n\r\nNiektóre osoby z koronawirusem są bezobjawowe, co oznacza, że ​​nie mają żadnych objawów. Niektórzy z wirusem nie mają żadnych objawów, ale rozwiną objawy koronawirusa; są uważane za przedobjawowe. Badania wykazały, że osoby bezobjawowe lub przedobjawowe są potencjalnie zakaźne i mogą nieświadomie zarażać innych\r\n\r\nW świetle tych informacji CDC zaleciło noszenie maski na twarz, aby ograniczyć przenoszenie i powstrzymać osoby bezobjawowe lub przedobjawowe przed zarażeniem innych.\r\n\r\n## Kto powinien nosić maskę domowej roboty?\r\n\r\nNoszenie domowej maski jest dobrowolne, ale CDC zaleca, aby większość ludzi je nosiła. Istnieje kilka wyjątków od tej rekomendacji.\r\n\r\nNastępujące osoby nie powinny ich nosić:\r\n\r\n- Dzieci poniżej drugiego roku życia\r\n- Osoby z problemami z oddychaniem\r\n- Osoby, które nie mogą zdjąć maski bez pomocy, takie jak osoby ubezwłasnowolnione lub niepełnosprawne\r\n\r\n## Używanie i pielęgnacja maski koronawirusa\r\n\r\nSkuteczne maski koronawirusowe podczas noszenia ściśle przylegają do twarzy. Podczas ich zdejmowania ważne jest, aby unikać dotykania twarzy – zwłaszcza oczu, nosa i ust. Umyj ręce natychmiast po zdjęciu maski.\r\n\r\nMaski należy czyścić po każdym użyciu. Częstotliwość ta będzie się różnić w zależności od tego, jak często musisz nosić maskę. CDC zaleca używanie pralki i suszarki w celu prawidłowego czyszczenia. Przeczytaj więcej o czyszczeniu z koronawirusa.\r\n\r\n## Stwórz własną maskę\r\n\r\nIstnieje wiele sposobów na wykonanie maski z tkaniny w domu. Nie wszystkie te metody wymagają maszyny do szycia.\r\n\r\nDomowe maski muszą spełniać te podstawowe wymagania:\r\n\r\n- Dopasowują się ciasno, ale wygodnie do boków twarzy\r\n-Bądź zabezpieczony krawatami lub pętlami na uszy\r\n- Mieć wiele warstw tkaniny\r\n- Pozwól na swobodne oddychanie\r\n-Można prać i suszyć maszynowo bez uszkodzeń i zmian kształtu\r\n\r\nAby zobaczyć zatwierdzone sposoby wykonania osłony twarzy, odwiedź witrynę CDC\r\n', 0, '2021-03-16 17:51:19', '2021-03-16 17:51:21', '/resources/images/coronavirus-tips-facemask.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/masks', 0, 0);

Transmisja koronawirusa może odbywać się na różne sposoby.\r\n\r\nDowiedz się więcej o rozprzestrzenianiu się COVID i o tym, co możesz zrobić, aby się chronić. Jednak w przyszłości najważniejszym sposobem ochrony przed wirusem, a także innymi osobami, jest zaszczepienie się na COVID-19, gdy będzie ona dostępna.\r\n\r\n## Jak rozprzestrzenia się koronawirus?\r\n\r\nChociaż nowy koronawirus jest wciąż bardzo nowy, dowiadujemy się więcej o różnych sposobach jego rozprzestrzeniania się. Istnieją trzy podstawowe tryby transmisji.\r\n\r\n### Kropelki oddechowe\r\n\r\nWedług CDC kropelki z układu oddechowego, które zawierają wirusa, są głównym nośnikiem rozprzestrzeniania się koronawirusa.\r\n\r\nKropelki z układu oddechowego są tworzone przez osoby zakaźne, kiedy kaszlą, kichają, śpiewają, krzyczą, mówią, a nawet oddychają. Jeśli pobliska osoba wdycha te kropelki, mogą się zarazić.\r\n\r\nJeśli te kropelki wylądują na pobliskich powierzchniach, mogą również zostać skażone.\r\n\r\n#### Unikanie transmisji oddechowej\r\n\r\n- Najlepszym sposobem zapobiegania rozprzestrzenianiu się koronawirusa jest dystansowanie się i unikanie ludzi, z którymi nie mieszkasz tak często, jak to możliwe.\r\n- Pozostanie w odległości co najmniej 6 stóp od innych osób może również znacznie zmniejszyć szanse na wdychanie kropelek oddechowych.\r\n- Noszenie maski może również pomóc w powstrzymaniu wydychanych kropelek oddechowych, a także w stworzeniu bariery między tobą a kropelkami oddechowymi osoby zakażonej.\r\n\r\n### Skontaktuj się z transmisją\r\n\r\nInnym głównym sposobem rozprzestrzeniania się koronawirusa jest bezpośredni kontakt z zarażoną osobą. Koronawirusa można również zarazić dotykając skażonej powierzchni, a następnie dotykając ust, nosa lub innej błony, która pozwoliłaby mu dostać się do organizmu.\r\n\r\n#### Unikanie transmisji kontaktu\r\n\r\nUpewnij się, że:\r\n\r\n- Pilnie umyj ręce\r\n- Prawidłowo wyczyść powierzchnie dotykowe\r\n- Unikaj dotykania twarzy\r\n\r\n### Transmisja wirusa w powietrzu\r\n\r\nW październiku CDC oficjalnie uznało, że koronawirus może rozprzestrzeniać się drogą powietrzną. Przenoszenie drogą powietrzną ma miejsce, gdy kropelki oddechowe zawierające wirusa pozostają zawieszone w powietrzu przez dłuższy czas (godziny, a nie minuty lub sekundy). Kropelki, które pozostają w powietrzu, mogą również podróżować na odległość większą niż 6 stóp.\r\n\r\n#### Unikanie transmisji w powietrzu\r\n\r\nIstnieją pewne sytuacje, których należy unikać, aby zmniejszyć ryzyko zakażenia drogą powietrzną:\r\n\r\n- **Zatłoczone przestrzenie.** Pomieszczenia z dużą ilością ludzi i słabą wentylacją mogą stanowić zagrożenie.\r\n- **Niewystarczająca wentylacja. **Przebywanie w zamkniętych przestrzeniach o niewielkiej wentylacji lub ruchu powietrza pozwala na gromadzenie się zawieszonych kropelek oddechowych w powietrzu. Jeśli osoba zakaźna znajduje się lub była niedawno w kosmosie, może dojść do transmisji drogą powietrzną.\r\n- **Uczestnictwo w zajęciach generujących nadmierne kropelki oddechowe. **Oprócz powyższego, niektóre działania wytwarzają więcej i mniejsze kropelki oddechowe niż inne, zwiększając prawdopodobieństwo przenoszenia drogą powietrzną w zamkniętych przestrzeniach. Działania te obejmują krzyki, śpiewy i ćwiczenia.\r\n\r\n## Czy koronawirus jest w powietrzu? \r\n\r\nChociaż od dawna wiemy o zdolności koronawirusa do rozprzestrzeniania się poprzez kropelki oddechowe, wielu zastanawiało się również, czy koronawirus jest przenoszony drogą powietrzną.\r\n\r\nPo przeanalizowaniu dostępnych obecnie dowodów CDC ustaliło, że koronawirus może rozprzestrzeniać się w powietrzu. Różnica między transmisją w powietrzu a kroplami może wydawać się kwestią techniczną, ale ma to wyraźne konsekwencje.\r\n\r\nKropelki oddechowe nie są takie same. Mogą być duże, widoczne nawet gołym okiem. Oznacza to, że szybko spadają na ziemię i są mniej podatne na wdychanie przez inną osobę.\r\n\r\nW transmisji powietrznej kropelki te są bardzo małe, co oznacza, że są lżejsze i mogą pozostawać w powietrzu przez dłuższy czas. Małe kropelki mogą również przemieszczać się na większe odległości, poruszając się z prądami powietrza. Oznacza to, że w niektórych przypadkach odległość 6 stóp może nie wystarczyć do ochrony.\r\n\r\nW środowisku opieki zdrowotnej podjęcie działań w celu powstrzymania transmisji ma zasadnicze znaczenie dla zapewnienia bezpieczeństwa pacjentom. Wszystkie szpitale University of Maryland Medical System od początku pandemii izolują pacjentów z koronawirusem lub podejrzewanych o to. Ta praktyka, która rozpoczęła się jako środek ostrożności, gdy dowiedzieliśmy się więcej o wirusie, stała się od tego czasu ważną częścią zapewniania bezpieczeństwa naszym pacjentom, gdy muszą iść do szpitala.\r\n\r\n## Czy pogoda wpływa na rozprzestrzenianie się koronawirusa?\r\n\r\nChociaż wirus jest nowy i nadal prowadzone są badania, od listopada 2020 r. związek między pogodą a rozprzestrzenianiem się koronawirusa nadal nie jest w pełni zrozumiały. Wiemy, że rozprzestrzenianie się koronawirusa może nadal mieć miejsce przy każdej pogodzie.\r\n\r\n**Jeśli tak, to dlaczego istnieje obawa, że ​​wirus pogorszy się zimą?**\r\n\r\nInne wirusy układu oddechowego, takie jak przeziębienie lub grypa, rozprzestrzeniają się bardziej w miesiącach zimowych. Niektórzy uważają, że wirusy mogą żyć dłużej w niższych temperaturach i niższej wilgotności, ale nadal jest to temat badań i nie jest obecnie uważany za główny czynnik sezonowości wirusów układu oddechowego.\r\n\r\nZamiast tego głównym czynnikiem wydaje się być ludzkie zachowanie. Kiedy robi się zimno, wycofujemy się do domu — często z innymi ludźmi w słabo wentylowanych pomieszczeniach. Pozwala to na łatwe rozprzestrzenianie się wysoce zakaźnych wirusów z osoby na osobę.\r\n\r\nOznacza to, że przedmioty takie jak nawilżacze, chociaż przydatne w łagodzeniu objawów chorób układu oddechowego, prawdopodobnie nie będą miały znaczącego wpływu na potencjalne rozprzestrzenianie się koronawirusa tej zimy. Najlepszym sposobem na ochronę jest stosowanie zalecanych przez CDC środków zapobiegających koronawirusowi.\r\n', 0, '2021-03-16 17:52:41', '2021-03-16 17:52:39', '/resources/images/coronavirus-spread.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/prevention-safety/coronavirus-spread', 0, 0);

Należy czyścić te obszary kilka razy dziennie.\r\n\r\nPonadto szybkie przeciągnięcie wilgotnym ręcznikiem papierowym nie wystarczy, aby zabić zarazki. Na przykład stoły i blaty muszą być wyraźnie wilgotne przez kilka minut. Sprawdź stronę środka czyszczącego, ponieważ zwykle podaje sugerowany czas, w którym powierzchnia musi być mokra, aby uzyskać maksymalny efekt.\r\n\r\n### Czyszczenie telefonu\r\n\r\nZarazki koronawirusa mogą żyć na naszych telefonach, dlatego musimy je teraz czyścić bardziej niż kiedykolwiek.\r\n\r\nKażdemu posiadaczowi iPhone\'a Apple zaleca użycie chusteczki nasączonej 70-procentowym alkoholem izopropylowym lub chusteczek dezynfekujących Clorox do delikatnego przetarcia zewnętrznych powierzchni iPhone\'a. Nie używaj wybielacza. Samsung nie skomentował, czy chusteczki to dobry sposób na czyszczenie telefonu.\r\n\r\nI nie zapomnij o etui na telefon.

Odgarniamy włosy z oczu, drapiemy się w nos, kilka razy w ciągu dnia kładziemy brody na dłoniach, nie wspominając o zakładaniu i zdejmowaniu okularów, pocieraniu czoła, a ostatnio zakładaniu i zdejmowaniu masek na twarz.\r\n\r\nZwróć uwagę, ile razy dotykasz twarzy w ciągu zaledwie godziny.

Może to obejmować obserwowanie innych ludzi. Zauważenie, jak często to robią, może przynieść ci świadomość.\r\n\r\n\r\n- ### Zmień sposób siedzenia.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Unikaj kładzenia łokci na blacie stołu, ponieważ często prowadzi to do oparcia brody na dłoniach. Możesz nawet spróbować usiąść na rękach lub złożyć je na kolanach, aby trzymać je z dala od twarzy.\r\n\r\n\r\n- ### Zajmij ręce.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Spróbuj użyć przędzarki typu fidget, dziania lub szydełka, gumki lub piłki antystresowej, aby mieć zajęte ręce.\r\n\r\n\r\n- ### Zwiąż lub przypnij włosy.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Jeśli twoje włosy powodują, że dotykasz twarzy, napraw je w nowy sposób, aby nie trzeba było odpychać ich z oczu.\r\n\r\n\r\n- ### Upewnij się, że okulary są dobrze dopasowane.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Nie powinny zsuwać się po twarzy. Jeśli musisz je podnieść lub zdjąć, chwytaj je z boku, a nie z mostka lub innych części, które dotykają twojej twarzy.\r\n\r\n\r\n- ### Użyj chusteczki.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Jeśli masz swędzenie lub z jakiegoś powodu musisz dotykać twarzy, trzymaj w dłoni czystą chusteczkę.\r\n\r\n\r\n- ### Zapobiegaj swędzeniu.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Użyj kremu nawilżającego, aby zapobiec wysuszeniu i swędzeniu skóry. Użyj kropli do oczu, jeśli twoje oczy są suche i swędzące. (Pamiętaj, aby umyć ręce przed i po użyciu kropli do oczu.) Leczyć sezonowe alergie, aby zapobiec swędzeniu nosa.\r\n\r\n\r\n- ### Noś zapach.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Na dłonie lub nadgarstki nałóż lekki perfum lub balsam, który poczujesz za każdym razem, gdy przyłożysz dłonie do twarzy.\r\n\r\n\r\n- ### Wyobraź sobie, że masz brudne ręce.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Nie widać zarazków na dłoni, więc udawaj, że masz na dłoniach coś widocznego, np. farbę lub błoto. Jest to bardziej przydatne w sytuacjach krótkoterminowych, takich jak zakupy w sklepie spożywczym.\r\n\r\n\r\n- ### Załóż maskę.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Maska na twarz może działać jako przypomnienie** **, aby nie dotykać twarzy. Należy jednak pamiętać, że jeśli noszenie maski sprawia, że ​​wiercisz się lub ciągle ją dopasowujesz, nie jest to dla ciebie dobra technika. W niektórych miejscach publicznych, takich jak sklepy czy przejazdy środkami transportu publicznego, nadal musisz nosić maskę na twarz.\r\n\r\nNawet jeśli doskonale radzisz sobie z nie dotykaniem twarzy, nadal musisz często myć ręce lub używać środków do dezynfekcji rąk na bazie alkoholu, zwłaszcza jeśli wychodzisz w miejscach publicznych. Ponieważ dotykanie twarzy jest nawykiem, wciąż będą chwile, gdy powrócisz do starych sposobów. Daj z siebie wszystko, ale myj ręce!\r\n', 0, '2021-03-16 17:58:08', '2021-03-16 17:58:10', '/resources/images/touch-face.jpg', 'https://www.umms.org/coronavirus/what-to-know/prevention-safety/protect/not-touch-face', 0, 0);

It looks like a magical dust that transforms into an even coat of paint. But it\'s completely different from nail polish. A regular manicure can chip immediately after you leave the salon, but most dip-powder manicures claim to last up to three weeks longer than gel manicures. So when my nail tech asked if I wanted to try it out, I was down. But I found out that it isn\'t a new technique at all, dip powder has actually been around since the ‘80s.\r\n\r\nThe name dip powder basically explains the process. First, a base coat is applied, and the nail is dipped into a powder. The process is repeated a couple of times depending on how many coats you want. Then, the rough, powdery layers are transformed into a smooth, glossy finish once a sealant is applied. The best part: You don\'t have to worry about the possibility of skin damage from UV lamps. Unlike the classic gel manicure, it dries instantly. And the powders don\'t pose any inhalation threats, according to chemist Doug Schoon, president of Schoon Scientific + Regulatory Consulting and co-chair of Nail Manufacturer’s Council. That\'s why it\'s being marketed with words like \"safe,\" \"natural,\" and \"organic.\" However those claims aren\'t regulated, and choosing the powders over gel manis isn\'t necessarily a better choice.\r\n\r\nRelated: If You Get Gel Manicures, This Is What You Need To Know About UV Lamps And Skin Cancer\r\n\r\nIn fact, gel manicures, dip powders, and traditional nail extensions have more in common than you think. They are all made up of an acrylic base. \"All of the ingredients used to make any type of artificial nail—whether they be glued, cured by UV, or mixed with a liquid and powder—are based on the acrylic family,\" Schoon says.\r\n\r\nSo, how do dip powders differ from acrylic nails and gel manicures? The grains are finer, which allows them to be created in more vibrant colors. Dip powders are bonded using a glue called cyanoacrylate, which is also the main ingredient in Krazy Glue. \"Acrylic nails\", on the other hand, are applied by combining a liquid with a powder to form a gel. Similarly, the ingredients in gel manicures are like pre-mixed acrylics, and they undergo a chemical reaction once they are cured with a UV lamp.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRelated: What Your Nails Can Tell You About Your Health\r\n\r\nSo, in theory they are all the same. But that doesn\'t mean that they are all bad for your nails. Schoon says that you could wear acrylics for years without harming your nails. You\'ll only see problems if the application, maintenance, or removal techniques are done incorrectly. That\'s why it\'s important to find a salon that doesn\'t rush during the removal process. The dip-powder manicures soak off just like gel manis but can take longer. \"One thing that people don’t understand is that if it says soak for fifteen minutes to remove, that’s the minimum time,\" Schoon says. And the longer you leave the acrylics on, the longer it will take to soak them off. \"It may be fifteen minutes if you take them off the same day, but if you wait two weeks or four weeks, it could take thirty minutes.\" The last thing you want to do is scrape off layers of your nails, so it\'s worth it to be patient. And there is no such thing as gently scraping. \"That\'s like saying I punched you gently in the nose,\" Schoon says.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to reserve dip powder and other acrylic-based manicures for special occasions. \"This may be great as a one time use when you want stronger nails,\" says celebrity nail stylist Elle. The acrylics will create a hard surface on your nails while you\'re wearing them. So, find a technician that won\'t rush through any steps, and one that can talk to you about how to properly take care of your nails in between appointments.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:12:14', '2021-05-28 19:12:17', '/resources/images/wps6.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/dip-powder-nail-polish-manicures', 0, 0);

But, she recently revealed, those manis come at a price. Rushmore-Perrin told the Daily Mail that she’s been getting acrylics for six years. She says she has them done professionally and usually has them removed by professionals, but she recently didn’t have time to visit the salon and decided to DIY. “One nail had come off, and I didn’t want to have nine nails on, so I started peeling and snapping them off,” she said. “I then soaked the remains off in acetone.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that didn’t end well. Rushmore-Perrin posted a photo on Twitter of her torn, cracked, and bleeding nails after she removed her acrylic manicure herself. In another tweet, she said the pain was excruciating. “Nearly cried in the shower at the hot water touching my nail beds and I\'m pretty sure there\'s still loads of shampoo left in my hair,\" she replied to the tweet. “Don’t even care how they look, it’s the physical PAIN dear lord.”\r\n\r\nRushmore-Perrin posted another photo of her much healthier-looking nails less than a week afterward. “Five days later, after taking two different kinds of biotin every day,” she captioned the photo. “Still not amazing or beautiful, but LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, biotin is necessary for the formation of fatty acids and glucose, which fuel the body. Biotin is also a B vitamin that helps provide the necessary building blocks for healthy hair and nail production, Joshua Zeichner, M.D., a New York City-based board-certified dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Rushmore-Perrin\'s case, doctors doubt biotin helped repair her nails. Your nails are only really alive at the base, Doris Day, M.D., a clinical associate professor of dermatology at the New York University Langone Medical Center, tells SELF. By the time nails grow beyond the cuticle, they’re just dead cells, similar to your hair. Therefore, any potential benefits from biotin supplements will be seen from the base on up, which is why Gary Goldenberg, M.D., medical director of the Dermatology Faculty Practice at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells SELF that although biotin is helpful in the development and growth of nails, it can take six to 12 months for people to see results. Day is skeptical Rushmore-Perrin\'s progress is due to the biotin, adding that the beauty blogger\'s nails likely got better because she stopped putting acrylics on and they had time to heal.\r\n\r\nAngelica Ross Gets a Buzz Cut, Talks Womanhood & Radical Blackness\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt\'s usually not necessary to take biotin for hair and nail benefits because it\'s rare for people to be deficient in biotin, Day says. That means people’s bodies typically make healthy hair and nails just fine without additional supplementation. If you do use a supplement, Zeichner says you won’t see any changes to hair and nails you already have. What you can expect, if your body is deficient in biotin, is new hair and nail growth that\'s potentially stronger and healthier than you\'re used to. Jill Waibel, M.D., founder and owner of The Miami Dermatology and Laser in Institute, tells SELF that biotin has been found to be especially helpful with brittle nails, which makes sense since that\'s a common sign of biotin deficiency.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to keep in mind: Supplements are unregulated and can definitely be dangerous or cause unpleasant side effects (many biotin-supplementing people complain of cystic acne online) if you take too many of them. Instead of popping a supplement, Goldenberg points out that it\'s better to get the vitamin from foods such as avocados, fish, and legumes.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re still intrigued, check in with your doctor or dermatologist—they\'ll be able to determine whether you have some sort of deficiency affecting your nails or hair, then be able to figure out an action plan from there.\r\n', 0, '2021-05-28 19:15:20', '2021-05-28 19:15:17', '/resources/images/wps7.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/biotin-nails-acrylics-repair', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (117, 14, 'What Is Dermaplaning and Should You Try It?', 'Here\'s what experts say you should know.', '![img](/resources/images/wps1-1622200668692.png) \r\n\r\nYou may have seen people on YouTube shaving their faces using small razors to exfoliate their skin or get rid of facial hair and wondered, “What is dermaplaning, and should I try it?”\r\n\r\nWhile those YouTube tutorials may make dermaplaning look like an easy “do it yourself” procedure, experts say you should avoid trying this at home for several reasons that we will explain. Plus, dermaplaning is not recommended for all skin types, so it’s best to consult with a dermatologist about whether it’s right for you. Below, dermatologists explain what you should know about dermaplaning, including the risks, benefits, and cost.\r\n\r\n***\\*What is dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nDermaplaning is a cosmetic procedure that involves scraping your face with a scalpel to remove the e pidermis—your top layer of skin—and small hairs, explains Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D., professor of dermatology, medicine, and nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Traditionally, people have the procedure done in a dermatologist’s office, however, you can find blades at the drugstore marketed for at-home dermaplaning use. That said, it’s safer for a professional to perform this. (We’ll get to all of that in a bit.) It’s also always a good idea to research any procedure you’re interested in, even if you delay the actual procedure itself because of the pandemic. (Here’s more information to help you navigate making medical appointments during COVID-19). \r\n\r\nDuring a dermaplaning session, the dermatologist uses a medical-grade scalpel to scrape across the surface of the skin. The treatment takes about 15 minutes, and it can cost anywhere from $40 to more than $150, depending on where you go.\r\n\r\n***\\*What are the benefits of dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nThe main reason people do it is to remove the vellus hairs on their faces, which some people refer to as peach fuzz. Everyone has these fine vellus hairs coating their bodies, and they serve a purpose: Vellus hairs keep us warm and add another layer of protection to the skin. But some people’s vellus hairs are thicker and more visible than others, and depending on how they feel about that, they might want to have it removed. Of course, dermaplaning is just one way to do that. There are many at-home hair removal kits that may get the job done, including the Glee Face Wax Hair Removal Strips for Women ($9, Walmart.com) that a SELF editor loves. However, dermatologist Rosemarie Ingleton, M.D., tells SELF that typical hair-removal methods like waxing and threading don’t always provide the results people are looking for, which makes dermaplaning an appealing option. You may have heard that shaving hair on your face makes hair grow back thicker—that’s technically not true. But it may look thicker or darker, thanks to having a blunter tip from shaving as it grows out, according to the Mayo Clinic.\r\n\r\nPeople might try laser hair removal for longer-lasting results, according to Jeanine Downie, M.D., a dermatologist in New Jersey. This method damages the hair follicles using heat, so your strands don’t grow back as easily. Although it is marketed as a permanent option, your hair may grow back after any hormonal changes (like menopause), according to the Cleveland Clinic. It also takes several sessions to see changes. The exact amount varies, and generally, people with dark skin need more sessions compared to people with light skin. This option also doesn’t work on gray hairs.\r\n\r\nDr. Ingleton says that the biggest reason she does dermaplaning in her practice is to remove vellus hairs, but that the blade also gets rid of a superficial layer of dead skin. This can make your skin look brighter, help your skin-care products sink in better, and make your foundation go on smoother. In Dr. Ingleton’s practice, dermaplaning is often an add-on done before other treatments like microdermabrasion or ablative lasers like Fraxel. When it comes to exfoliating, there are no studies showing how dermaplaning compares to other treatments like retinoids or chemical peels, says Dr. Kim. That’s one reason why Dr. Downie prefers to use peels over dermaplaning—even for sensitive skin—and doesn’t offer dermaplaning in her practice. “Peels help to improve texture, tone, acne, and fine lines,” she says. “They are not equivalent at all, and many peels give deeper exfoliation than a scalpel,” Dr. Downie says.\r\n\r\nIs it ok to try dermaplaning at home?\r\n\r\nWhile it might feel like getting rid of these hairs is easy to do at home with an inexpensive blade, professionals warn against it. Any blade you get over-the-counter won’t be as sharp—or as effective—as the medical-grade scalpel used at the office. Also, there’s always the chance you will cut yourself in the process, potentially causing scarring.\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nAnytime a sharp object goes near your face, there is a risk of damage to the skin. Dr. Downie says that she’s seen patients with scarring after a dermaplaning session gone wrong. Although some medical spas offer dermaplaning, Dr. Downie recommends seeing a professional board-certified dermatologist for this kind of procedure. Board certification is an extra certification step that shows a physician completed advanced training in their specialty. (You can find a board-certified specialist by visiting The American Academy of Dermatology website.)\r\n\r\n***\\*How often should you have dermaplaning done?\\****\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the hair away, you might have to get treated about once a month. (Of course, the exact timeline will look different for each person.) Dr. Kim says this is not a treatment you should do too frequently. Our epidermis helps protect us from allergens and other potential irritants in the outside world—dermaplaning too often may irritate or damage that top layer of protection, she says. Again, this is why it’s best to consult with a physician who can help you decide on the appropriate frequency for your skin and needs.\r\n\r\n***\\*When should you avoid dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nThere are a few instances where you should think twice before signing up for dermaplaning. If you have acne, there is a chance that the blade could nick a pimple, says Dr. Downie, which means it would take longer to heal. So if you have something like a serious cystic breakout happening, it might be best to postpone. Ideally, you want to consult with a doctor who has experience with acne-prone patients. Also, tell your dermatologist if you have a history of cold sores. “If you have a breakout of cold sores, you need to be on Valtrex, and the physician ne eds to avoid the area,” says Dr. Downie. Without the use of a preventive oral anti-herpes medication, the cold sores can spread due to microtears in the skin.\r\n\r\n***\\*Is there anything else to know about dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nAfter a dermaplaning treatment, you do need to take care of your skin. “You have to coat your skin with sunblock afterwards because you’re going to be more sensitive to the sun,” says Dr. Downie. “You also have to be cautious of retinol and glycolic acids.” Dermatologists recommend that people with sensitive skin use a light moisturizer like Vanicream ($36, Amazon) because it doesn’t contain fragrances or other irritants. If you do choose to try dermaplaning, just be sure to work with a professional dermatologist for the safest possible experience.\r\n\r\nAll products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (118, 14, 'How to Manage Retinization When Using Retinoids', 'The first month on retinoids can be brutal.', '![img](/resources/images/wps2.png)\r\n\r\nBeauty editors praise retinoids for being a skin-care ingredient that seemingly does it all. They’re powerful enough to decrease acne, pigmentation, and wrinkles. But first comes the retinization period, where you might experience reddened, peeling, and dry skin. During this time, your skin is adjusting to the medication, and let’s not mince words, it sucks.\r\n\r\nIf you previously tried retinoids but thought they weren’t for you because of the side effects, then we have some good news: You can try again if you want. “Almost everyone can use retinoids if you tailor it to yourself,” Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D, professor of Dermatology, Medicine, and Nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, tells SELF. The key is figuring out the right strength and how often you can use it, she says. Even most of her patients with rosacea or sensitive skin can generally use a mild retinoid sparingly, she explains.\r\n\r\nWe spoke to a few experts about what you should know about retinoids and tips to keep in mind.\r\n\r\n1. What are retinoids, and why should you use them?\r\n\r\nThere’s a good chance you’ve heard of “retinols,” and you might be wondering if they are different from retinoids. It’s easiest to think of retinoids as a family of compounds derived from vitamin A, explains Dr. Kim. Then, there are retinols, or a form of retinoids commonly found in over-the-counter skin care products, and retinoic acid, found in prescription medications. But again, these are all forms of vitamin A, which can help your skin cells turn over more quickly when applied topically.\r\n\r\n“It’s very confusing because people just call everything retinols, but there are differences,” says Dr. Kim. The most important thing for you to remember is that retinoic acid requires a prescription and retinols can be found in products at your drugstore. Retin-A, or tretinoin as it’s called generically, is one popular brand of prescription retinoic acid.\r\n\r\nRetinoids may reduce wrinkles because they activate your skin’s natural collagen and elastin (two fibers that keep it strong). They’re also good exfoliators since they force your skin cells to turn over more quickly, which helps reduce acne, says Dr. Kim. In six to eight weeks, retinoids can clear up and prevent acne, reduce the look of fine lines, and lighten hyperpigmentation until it disappears. But prescription retinoids are strong stuff, so your skin is likely to get sensitive and irritated as it gets used to their mechanisms of action. Over-the-counter retinols can cause light irritation, but it\'s less severe since they are formulated to be gentler than prescription options. Because retinols are weaker, you may not notice skin changes, e.g., less acne, for several months, Dr. Kim says.\r\n\r\n2. What is retinization?\r\n\r\nLike we said, retinization is that period where your skin is adjusting to the retinoids. Generally, your skin may feel irritated, dry, and begin peeling, explains Dr. Kim. It starts a few days after you first start applying the medication and can last about a month (give or take a couple weeks) while your skin builds up a tolerance. Even people with sensitive skin can generally use some form of retinoids, says Dr. Kim. However, they might need to try the following skin care strategies to help reduce irritation, especially if using a prescription retinoid. Or, people with sensitive skin may need to try over-the-counter retinols since these are less irritating. Dr. Kim likes Differin Gel ($16, Amazon.com) since it was previously available by prescription and has been well-tested. As with most health concerns, it is best to consult with a dermatologist who can help you develop a plan that works for your specific skin. Right now, many physicians are offering virtual appointments using video chat. (Here’s what you need to know about scheduling medical appointments during COVID-19).\r\n\r\n3. Prepare your skin before starting retinoids.\r\n\r\nThe best prep you can do for your new retinoid regimen is to make sure your face isn’t dehydrated. “Moisturized skin has a better barrier function,” meaning that it’s at peak protection for whatever you throw at it, Beverly Hills dermatologist and founder of SkinxFive Ava Shamban, M.D., tells SELF. She says that means starting on a solid moisturization routine—morning and night—at least a week or so before you begin using the medication.\r\n\r\n4. Apply moisturizer before your retinoid at night.\r\n\r\nLayering the retinoid over a gentle moisturizer will help temper any irritation. Look for a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, ceramides, antioxidants, or redness-relieving peptides. Finding the right moisturizer for your particular skin type isn’t always easy. You can read our guide on moisturizer if you need help finding a product you like. The CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Lotion ($18, Amazon.com) is one dermatologist-recommended pick that works well for combination skin, for instance.\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nNote: The skin around your eyes is extra sensitive, and you shouldn’t apply retinoids to the upper eyelids at the risk of getting product in your eye. Protect the entire eye area with a thick moisturizer before putting retinoids on the rest of your face.\r\n\r\n5. Don’t start by applying retinoids every day.\r\n\r\nRetinoids aren’t something you should apply every day from the start. You have to work your way up to regular use. “Start slowly applying twice per week and then gradually add another day until you have built up tolerance for daily use,” RealSelf dermatologist Michele Green, M.D., tells SELF. If your skin has an adverse reaction, such as excessive peeling, lay off the treatment for a couple days. Then, you can try again but decrease the amount of times you use it per week. For example, if you experienced irritation after using it four times in a week, then bump your frequency down to three and see how your skin reacts. Some people can only tolerate using retinoids about twice a week, explains Dr. Kim.\r\n\r\n6. Change to a simple skin-care routine.\r\n\r\nFor the first month of regular retinoid use, your skin is officially classified as “sensitive.” That means you need to change up your cleansing and exfoliating routine. “Using a gentle detergent cleanser will allow some natural oils to remain on the skin, reducing the likelihood of developing the irritant dermatitis,” says Dr. Shamban. She says to look for something that is cream-based like Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser ($10, Amazon.com).\r\n\r\nAlso give up your masks, peels, and exfoliating scrubs. “Retinol will naturally exfoliate the skin,” says Dr. Shamban. “There is no reason to do any kind of a manual dermabrasion or exfoliating.” Dr. Green adds that you should avoid applying any other skin-care products with retinol, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and glycolic acid as they can be too harsh on your skin during retinization.\r\n\r\n7. Treat dry patches with extra moisturizer.\r\n\r\nDry patches and peeling will likely happen when you use retinoids. Dr. Shamban recommends applying aloe gel or 1 percent hydrocortisone cream like CeraVe Anti-Itch Cream ($9, Amazon.com) during the day to help with flakiness and irritation.\r\n\r\n8. Be patient about your results.\r\n\r\n“In dermatology, people want to do something once and that’s it,” says Dr. Kim. However, she says that you need to be patient and play the long game when it comes to retinoids. “You want to use this for a long time to really see the benefit of what these can do for your skin,” she says. So if a prescription retinoid is irritating, then you may want to use a weaker retinol. Or your doctor may be able to prescribe you a lower-dose retinoid that your skin tolerates.\r\n\r\n9. Call your dermatologist if you’re in pain.\r\n\r\nYes, some redness and itchiness are expected, but if you have an extreme reaction, it needs professional attention. “If your face starts to look like a charred tomato, it’s time to back off and see a physician,” Dr. Shamban says. Dr. Green seconds this sentiment, “If the skin starts to crack and you have open lesions which are oozing, you should definitely stop using the product and see your dermatologist. Also, if you develop a rash, this could mean you are having an allergic reaction to the product.” Again, you may not feel comfortable with physical office visits right now. But your dermatologist may be able to provide care through a virtual session, so it’s worth calling their office to check.\r\n\r\nAdditional reporting by Melissa Matthews\r\n\r\nAll products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (119, 14, '10 Things to Know Before Trying Dermal Fillers', 'Read this before making your appointment.', '![img](/resources/images/wps3.png) \r\n\r\nOur bodies naturally change with age, and those differences might include new wrinkles on our faces or cheekbones that aren’t as high as they once were. Dermal fillers can help minimize these signs of aging if you’re unhappy with them.\r\n\r\nHowever, these changes are completely normal and occur when we lose some of the subcutaneous fat that supports our skin. Over time, the skin on the middle of our faces shifts down too, causing our cheeks to sag a bit, explains Mary Stevenson, M.D., dermatologist at NYU Langone Health. “Filler can be used to help lift and add support,” she tells SELF. It can also help soften wrinkles, Dr. Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nThere are several categories of dermal fillers, and they’re all generally administered in the same way (more on that in a bit). Before electing to have any type of cosmetic or medical procedure, it’s important to understand what the process entails and any potential risks. Understandably, you might also have concerns about visiting a doctor’s office during the pandemic. Our story about making medical appointments during COVID-19 can help you decide if now is the right time to schedule an elective procedure. But below, you’ll find information experts think you should know about dermal fillers\r\n\r\n1. What exactly are dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nFirst things first: Dermal fillers are not to be confused with Botox, injectable drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to smooth lines and wrinkles. The latter \"freezes\" muscles to reduce wrinkles, while dermal fillers are injectable implants approved by the FDA to help smooth skin and wrinkles. As the name implies, they are injected beneath your skin using a needle.\r\n\r\nAccording to the FDA, there are four categories of fillers. Each is named for the type of material they’re made with:\r\n\r\nHyaluronic acid is naturally produced by your body and already found in your skin and cartilage. Generally, fillers made with hyaluronic acid last between 6-12 months.\r\n\r\nCalcium hydroxylapatite is a mineral that is found in our bones. Fillers made with this material last up to 18 months.\r\n\r\nPoly-L-lactic acid is a biodegradable synthetic material that’s also used to make medical products like dissolvable stitches. These fillers may last up to two years.\r\n\r\nPolymethylmethacrylate beads are the only filler that can’t be absorbed by your body, meaning the results are permanent. They’re only used around the mouth.\r\n\r\nHyaluronic acid, which you may recognize as a common ingredient in some skincare products, is one of the most popular types of fillers, explains Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D, professor of dermatology, medicine, and nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Because it helps skin retain moisture, hyaluronic acid can make your face look more plump and hydrated. It\'s also used in lotions as a moisturizer, but no cream can restore lost volume—only injectable hyaluronic acid can do that. Juvéderm and Restylane are two popular name brand hyaluronic fillers that you may have heard of.\r\n\r\n2. How do I know which dermal filler to try?\r\n\r\nA good doctor will explain the ideal treatment plan for you, but know that the most natural-looking results may require more than one type of filler. There are many different brands of fillers within each category, and the products vary in how they should be used—like filling out cheeks—and concentration of the active ingredient, explains Dr. Kim. For example, Restylane, one brand of hyaluronic filler, has five different lines—and each is used for different reasons. \"Restylane Lyft has larger particle sizes—think of them like the bricks of a foundation,\" Whitney Bowe, M.D. a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, tells SELF. Those larger particles have the heft to \"rebuild\" thinned cheekbones, while a smaller particle size, as in Restylane Silk, works better for addressing fine lines and plumping lips.\r\n\r\n3. Why do people get dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nDr. Kim explains that patients come to her saying “they just want to look a little better,” without turning to cosmetic surgery. She uses dermal fillers to add in volume and smooth out wrinkles, which her patients are normally happy with, she says.\r\n\r\nWATCH\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nDermal fillers are particularly popular because patients see differences in their appearances before leaving her office, Dr. Kim says. Generally, people notice the desired changes from other non-surgical procedures, like Botox, after a few days.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note: Dermal fillers are not FDA-approved for body contouring procedures. In other words, they shouldn’t be used to increase the size of your breasts or butt.\r\n\r\n4. What precautions should I take before getting fillers?\r\n\r\nIt probably goes without saying, but safety should be your top priority when considering any medical procedure. Dr. Kim says visiting a board-certified dermatologist or a board-certified plastic surgeon is one way to ensure that your physician is experienced. This extra certification step shows that the doctor completed additional training in their particular specialty. (You can find a board-certified specialist by visiting The American Board of Plastic Surgery or the American Academy of Dermatology websites.) Even though dermal fillers are available at medical spas, you should see only licensed and trained physicians for any injectable treatment. There are risks for issues like infection, discoloration, and lumps if injections are done incorrectly.\r\n\r\nGiven that this is a cosmetic procedure, you understandably want to be satisfied with the results. One way to find a doctor whose work you like is by asking friends who have had this done for their recommendations. \"People are starting to be more open about injectables,\" Ava Shamban, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist in Los Angeles, tells SELF.\r\n\r\n5. What should I ask my doctor during the consultation?\r\n\r\n“I think as a patient you should always ask for a consultation first and then really talk about what your goal is and how they [the doctor] can help you,” says Dr. Kim. You may think you just want dermal fillers, but an expert could recommend another treatment—or a combination of treatments—based on your specific skin type and goals. For example, your doctor may suggest using laser therapy if you have a lot of pigmentation, she says.\r\n\r\nDr. Shamban advises requesting before-and-after photographs of real patients from the doctor’s office. Every practitioner has different philosophies, techniques, and levels of experience. And don\'t be afraid to ask about your doctor’s training and certification during the initial consultation.\r\n\r\nLastly, you and your physician should communicate about realistic results and your expectations—it\'s your face, after all.\r\n\r\n6. What are the possible side effects of fillers?\r\n\r\nEven non-surgical procedures have their risks. The most common side effects include bruising, redness, pain, or swelling, all of which should go away within two weeks, according to the FDA. Less frequently, people might get raised bumps under their skin that need to be treated with injections, medications, or even surgically removed, according to the FDA.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is rare, filler can accidentally be injected into a blood vessel and lead to blurred vision or permanent blindness. You should call your doctor or the emergency room if your skin turns blue and you’re in a lot of pain—these are two possible signs that filler is in your bloodstream. Again, this is why you want to see an experienced doctor who is skilled in performing the procedure.\r\n\r\n7. Who should avoid dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nAccording to the FDA, there’s no research showing that dermal fillers are safe for pregnant or breastfeeding people, so you may want to hold off if you’re expecting a baby or recently had a child. And here\'s one more thing to consider: Avoid getting filler right before a teeth cleaning or other dental treatment, Dr. Shamban says. These procedures require pressure and stretching of the face that could potentially misplace fillers. You can ask your doctor for their opinion regarding when it’s safe to get any future dental work during your consultation.\r\n\r\n8. How much do dermal fillers cost?\r\n\r\nIf the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. If you see a deal for inexpensive filler, be skeptical. \"You have to be careful,\" Dr. Shamban says, adding that counterfeit and diluted filler do exist. \"Ask to see the box, and look for a safety seal on it.\" The price of these fillers varies depending on the amount of product needed. In 2019, the average cost of hyaluronic acid fillers was $652 per syringe, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. They estimate that most patients need more than one syringe to achieve the results they’re looking for.\r\n\r\n9. Are dermal fillers permanent?\r\n\r\nIf you\'re unhappy with the way filler looks, don\'t panic—in most cases, you can have it adjusted. A dermatologist might inject additional filler for balance, or they can dissolve it altogether, depending on the type. \"The wonderful thing about hyaluronic acid fillers is that there\'s an enzyme that can be injected into the area to dissolve the product,\" Dr. Shamban says. \"It just goes away.\"\r\n\r\nBut when expertly injected, filler should look natural. \"The changes we can make are so subtle that nobody would notice,\" says Dr. Shamban. \r\n\r\n10. How long will the results last?\r\n\r\nSince the majority of fillers aren’t permanent, you\'ll have to keep going back to the doctor’s office if you love the results following your procedure. After about six months, your body naturally breaks down hyaluronic acid fillers. So, you have to get touch-ups once or twice a year to maintain the look. However, this is good news if you just want to try fillers once or twice, since the effects will fade away without any long-term risks.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:19:50', '2021-05-28 19:19:51', '/resources/images/wps3.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/dermal-fillers', 1, 0);

Whether it’s 100 degrees and humid or pouring rain, I make sure that my face is saturated with a healthy dollop of sun protection before leaving the house. I thought I’d discovered all my skin-care favorites—until I tried Supergoop! Play Everyday Lotion’s updated reef-safe sunscreen formula. \r\n\r\nI already count Supergoop!’s Unseen Sunscreen among my product ride-or-dies, but after emptying my last tube this summer, I decided to venture out of my comfort zone and test Supergoop! Play, which is suitable for both face and body. Typically I’m wary of two-in-one skin products (I don’t fully endorse the idea of body wash that also works for your face, for example). But I was willing to give this a shot because I love Supergoop!—and it didn’t disappoint.\r\n\r\nI totally get why this is called Everyday Lotion, since its consistency is just as creamy and lightweight as some of my favorite moisturizers. Although it goes on white, the sunscreen has an invisible finish once rubbed in, unlike a lot of lotions that leave a chalky cast. It’s nongreasy with a pleasantly mild scent, and my skin drinks this stuff up with little effort. Supergoop! Play\'s chameleon-like ability to work on both my face and body without triggering breakouts is truly a game changer, and I no longer have to bother switching between a bunch of sun-protection products on the regular. \r\n\r\nSince Supergoop! Play offers broad-spectrum SPF 50 protection, plus has a water- and sweat-resistant formula, I don’t worry about it wearing off during outdoor workouts. I can happily wear it in the ocean and actually feel good about it, as it is now officially a reef-safe sunscreen, meaning it doesn’t contain chemical UV filters like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are known to be harmful to coral reefs and other sea life. \r\n\r\nNow that I’ve added this new gold star to my list of skin-care go-tos, I’m ready to graduate from the handheld 2.4-ounce size right to the jumbo, easy-to-pump 18-ounce version.

INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (121, 14, 'Watch Shay Mitchell Get Her First Treatment for Post-Pregnancy Melasma ', 'A week later, she\'s already seeing results.', '![img](/resources/images/wps6.png) \r\n\r\nShay Mitchell, who gave birth to her daughter this past October, recently walked her Instagram followers through her first intense pulsed light therapy (IPL) treatment session. She sought out the treatment to help manage her melasma, a skin condition often associated with pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIn the IGTV post, Mitchell starts with a mirror selfie showing off her comfy outfit (and mask!). She announces that this is her first melasma treatment and offers some background information about melasma and IPL treatments. Then, after a quick shot of her face with numbing cream, Mitchell takes a moment to show the camera her “little melasma spot” just below her eye and points to a patch of melasma on her upper lip. “Especially for new moms,” she says. “We go out in the sun and this is what happens.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Mitchell says she was too nervous to take video during the actual treatment, immediately after it she reports that her face is numb and that the IPL felt like “a million little elastic bands hitting all over.” She also points out a few red areas on her face that the treatment had targeted. Her facial treatment continues with a soothing collagen mask.\r\n\r\nThen, Mitchell cuts to an update from a week after her first treatment. She seems happy with the results so far. Although she says it’s recommended to get another one or two treatments, after the first one she feels that “we’re on track to lightening these little guys up.”\r\n\r\nMelasma is a form of hyperpigmentation that frequently shows up during or after pregnancy. The condition is so frequently associated with pregnancy that it’s sometimes even called the mask of pregnancy, SELF explained previously. It usually causes patches of brown or grayish-brown skin on the cheeks, forehead, nose, upper lip, and chin. Those patches aren’t harmful or painful, and sometimes, they’ll fade away on their own. But some people may want to have them lightened or removed.\r\n\r\nFirst off, as Mitchell points out, melasma is exacerbated by UV exposure, so wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 is usually a mainstay of melasma treatment and maintenance. Plus, recent research suggests that those with melasma may benefit from using a sunscreen containing iron oxides, which help block visible light from the sun and devices, like your phone or laptop.\r\n\r\nFrom there, treatment usually involves topical medications, such as prescription hydroquinone, which can lighten skin, the American Academy of Dermatology explains. Tretinoin, a powerful retinoid that speeds up the cell turnover process, is another common choice, as are corticosteroid medications and azelaic acid. \r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nBut topical medications aren’t always enough, which is where treatments like the one Mitchell received come in. For more stubborn melasma, a dermatologist might recommend in-office procedures like microdermabrasion, chemical peels, or laser treatments. The specific treatment Mitchell got—IPL—is similar to laser treatments but involves the use of multiple light wavelengths to treat certain issues. It’s especially useful in managing hyperpigmentation, broken blood vessels sometimes seen in rosacea, and age spots.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that nonablative treatments like this stimulate the growth of new collagen by heating up the skin, SELF explained previously. However, for most skin conditions, multiple treatments are required for you to see noticeable results. Mitchell specifically mentions in her video that she’s hoping her melasma spots will look lighter after three sessions.\r\n\r\nAfter treatment, it’s normal for the skin to be a little red, swollen, and sensitive for a few hours or a few days, Baylor College of Medicine explains.

INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (122, 14, 'Here’s Why You Get Sun Spots on Your Face—And How to Treat Them', 'They’re usually harmless.', '![img](/resources/images/wps8.png) \r\n\r\nIf you’ve spent any time in the sun throughout your life, you may have developed some sun spots on your face. These spots (also called age spots, liver spots, or solar lentigines) appear as flat, smooth brown spots on areas of your skin that tend to get a lot of sun exposure.\r\n\r\nSun spots are generally harmless areas of pigmented skin, but they can be easily confused with other types of sun-related spots on the skin, including some that may actually be a sign of skin cancer. If you think you have sun spots on your face, it’s important to monitor them and to get anything that looks iffy checked out by a board-certified dermatologist.\r\n\r\nHere’s what you need to know about sun spots, how to prevent them, how dermatologists can treat or remove them, and signs to look for that may signal an issue.\r\n\r\nWhat causes sun spots on your face?\r\n\r\nSun spots on your face are a type of hyperpigmentation caused by UV exposure. Essentially, after being exposed to the sun, your skin increases production of melanin, the pigment that gives skin color. Over time, some areas of your skin may develop clumps of melanin or may overproduce that pigment, resulting in a sun spot, the Mayo Clinic explains.\r\n\r\nThese types of spots tend to show up on areas of your body where you get the most sun, which might include your face, shoulders, hands, chest, and the back of your hands, Mary L. Stevenson, M.D., assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. Sun spots tend to be flat rather than raised, are usually brown, and may appear in clusters.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to prevent sun spots?\r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent sun spots on your face is to develop and maintain solid sun safety habits. “They can be prevented with diligent sun protection including use of sunscreen on regular basis, and other forms of sun protection like hats, sun glasses, and clothing,” Nada Elbuluk, M.D., clinical assistant professor of dermatology (clinician educator), Keck School of Medicine of USC, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nThat includes using broad spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) every day, particularly on areas of your body that are prone to sun exposure, like your face, your shoulders, and the back of your hands. Sun spots are more likely to show up on people with lighter skin, Elbuluk says, but people with darker skin tones can still develop sun-related skin damage, so it’s important for everyone to wear sunscreen regularly.\r\n\r\nBut we know that it’s a bit difficult to stick to diligent sunscreen wearing (and reapplication) habits—and even perfect sunscreen usage doesn’t protect you from 100% of the sun’s rays. That’s why it’s crucial to also use other sun protection strategies, like wearing sun-protective clothing, sticking to the shade whenever possible, and wearing hats and sunglasses that block the sun.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nEltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 ($38, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nNeutrogena Ultra-Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreen SPF 30 ($10, Amazon)\r\n\r\nLa Roche Posay Anthelios Mineral Sunscreen Gentle Lotion SPF 50 ($22, Amazon)\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to treat sun spots?\r\n\r\nTrue sun spots are not harmful and don\'t need to be treated. If you do decide you want to have your sun spots treated or removed for cosmetic reasons, this is something you’ll likely have to see a professional about. Although you can certainly try some products containing the classic brightening ingredients, like hydroquinone, retinoids, or vitamin C, “over-the-counter products are typically not strong enough to have a significant effect on sun spots,” Elbuluk explains.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nAlthough some of those products can be helpful in preventing sun spots and generally evening out your skin tone, they aren’t likely to be enough once you have the spots, Stevenson says. So if you want to have a sun spot removed, you’ll need to talk to a board-certified dermatologist. They may recommend using a prescription-strength lightening cream or procedures such as professional chemical peels or laser treatments, Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nAfter a laser treatment, the spot will usually “turn a little white, crust, and then peel off,” Stevenson explains, so that you’re left with a subtly pink area that eventually fades. After doing all that work to have the spot removed, it’s really important to keep it from getting any more sun, she says, especially while it’s still healing, because laser treatments can make your skin more sensitive to sun exposure. In fact, Stevenson says she generally doesn’t treat sun spots during the summer because of this risk for more pigmentation after treatment. \r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes other types of spots (called seborrheic keratoses) are confused with sun spots, Stevenson says. Seborrheic keratoses, like sun spots, are harmless brown, tan, or black growths on the skin, the Mayo Clinic explains. However, unlike true sun spots, these marks tend to be slightly raised, which means they may need to be shaved down or destroyed with electrocautery. These procedures may then be combined with laser treatments to further remove the pigment. Many people who are prone to sun spots are also prone to seborrheic keratoses, so it’s common to have both Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nHyperpigmentation on the face might also be melasma, a condition that tends to appear in patches on the cheeks, forehead, nose, or chin, SELF explained previously.\r\n\r\nWhen should you talk to a dermatologist?\r\n\r\nAlthough true sun spots aren’t harmful, they are a result of sun damage and therefore can be a sign that you need to get better at protecting yourself from sun exposure.\r\n\r\nSometimes, cancerous spots on your skin can look like sun spots or seborrheic keratoses, the Mayo Clinic says. So if you have a lot of sun spots or you notice one that looks suspicious or odd, it’s always a good idea to get checked out by a dermatologist. \r\n\r\nIn particular, it’s important to take note of any spots that seem to be growing or changing rapidly. “If [you have] a brown spot that seems to be changing in size, color, or appearance, then it may not be a sun spot and should be examined by a board-certified dermatologist to rule out skin cancer,” Elbuluk says.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:20:57', '2021-05-28 19:20:59', '/resources/images/wps8.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/sun-spots-on-face', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (123, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Spider Veins and Varicose Veins', 'This isn’t a DIY situation.', '![img](/resources/images/wps9.png)\r\n\r\nIf you’re wondering how to get rid of spider veins, you’ve probably already come across a bunch of the internet’s suggestions. When I noticed a series of faint blue lines twisting around my thigh, some of the recommended home remedies I saw included ginger tea, massage, and even exercise. But here’s the honest truth: That’s all B.S. Visible veins aren’t something you can fix at home.\r\n\r\nSo I talked to dermatologists and surgeons who specialize in treating spider veins and varicose veins (the larger, raised visible veins that often appear on the legs). What I learned is that the underlying causes of these visible veins aren’t always preventable—and they can be a sign of a much deeper vein problem that no home remedy is likely to fix. Here’s how to get rid of spider veins for real—and why it’s so important to see a specialist to do so.\r\n\r\nWhat actually are spider veins?\r\n\r\nThere are two common types of visible veins: spider veins and varicose veins. “Spider veins are really small superficial veins that are in the outer layer of skin between the dermis and epidermis, so you can see them,” Christopher Hollingsworth, M.D., a general surgeon at NYC Surgical Associates, tells SELF. “If you live long enough, most people are going to get them.” These veins get their name because they look like thin, weblike, blue-and-purple lines on the legs.\r\n\r\nVaricose veins, on the other hand, are larger veins that are deeper in the body. “You won’t see them as a discoloration, you’ll see them when they get so stretched out that they kind of bulge,” Dr. Hollingsworth says.\r\n\r\nBecause these two issues are caused by similar blood-flow situations, varicose and spider veins commonly occur together. That means that people who have varicose veins almost always have spider veins too. However, some people get spider veins and never have a problem with varicose veins.\r\n\r\nWhat causes spider veins and other visible veins?\r\n\r\nTo understand why these visible veins develop, you’ve got to understand how blood flows through the body. Your heart pumps blood to your entire body through your blood vessels. From there, blood circulates outward toward the extremities (legs, arms, head) through the arteries and back inward to the heart through your veins.\r\n\r\n“Think of veins as being a hose that flows from bottom-up toward your heart,” says dermatologist Alicia Barba, M.D., of Barba Dermatology. “And there’s a little valve. When they work well, the blood shoots up and the valve closes. When it doesn’t work, the blood falls back down instead of moving north.”\r\n\r\nWhen blood flows in the wrong direction because of a valve problem, it can get backed up in the veins of the legs, which damages the walls of the vein, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) explains. That extra pressure on the vein walls gradually causes them to weaken and then bulge, creating veins we can actually see. In fact, the majority of people who have spider veins and/or varicose veins will be dealing with this type of “venous insufficiency,” Dr. Hollingsworth says.\r\n\r\nHowever, other factors can contribute to the likelihood that you’ll develop visible veins, including genetics, age, and your level of physical activity, the AAD says.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you have a job where you are standing still for long periods of time, gravity is at work pulling the blood back down toward the legs, causing the veins to get stretched out and the valves to weaken over time. If you sit all day at your job, you can also start to see visible veins because there is a lack of muscle movement. The muscles in the leg help the veins push the blood back up toward the heart, so moving around during the day can help prevent visible veins. (That rumor that crossing your legs can cause spider veins isn’t true, so go ahead and cross ’em if you like—just make sure that you get out of your chair and move around during the day to get the blood pumping.)\r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nThere is some research to suggest that carrying extra weight can impact the function of your veins and, therefore, also increase your risk for visible veins. Having more fat around your stomach (visceral fat) can increase the pressure in your abdomen, Dr. Hollingsworth says, which then creates an obstruction that blocks the flow of blood. “That increased pressure dilates the veins, which extends all the way through the lower vein bridge and all the way up to the veins in your skin,” he explains.\r\n\r\nA similar situation happens during pregnancy when the added pressure in the abdomen squeezes the veins. But the hormonal shifts that happen during pregnancy may also play a role. “When women are exposed to excess estrogen or progesterone, what it tends to do is make your soft tissue a little more flexible,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. “That same process, we think, is affecting the veins, making them predisposed to dilate and stretch out.” After pregnancy, the veins generally go away and everything returns to normal. This vein weakening can also happen if you’re taking hormonal birth control.\r\n\r\nAlthough visible veins may seem like a purely superficial issue, they can become painful when left untreated. “Spider and varicose veins make your legs sore because it’s an inflammatory process,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. “Those veins are getting dilated and stretched out. They’re trying to signal for help in the only way they know how, which is sending off a local inflammatory biochemical that causes your legs to swell and to be sore.” So preventing and treating spider veins can save you from a lot of discomfort.\r\n\r\nCan you do anything to prevent spider veins?\r\n\r\nThere are a few different underlying causes of vein issues that are preventable or reversible, while others aren\'t. For instance, if your visible veins are largely due to inherited factors, pregnancy, or how active you can be during the work day, that’s not likely something you have a ton of control over.\r\n\r\nBut there are some general things you can do to prevent them, such as maintaining physical activity during the day. If you sit at work all day, the AAD recommends getting up and walking around a bit every 30 minutes. Or, if you stand at work for long periods of time, the AAD recommends taking a break and sitting down every 30 minutes. And exercising in general, elevating your legs when possible, and avoiding soaking for long periods of time in hot baths can help prevent visible veins as well, the AAD says.\r\n\r\nHowever, these strategies can’t treat any visible veins you already have.\r\n\r\nYou’ll need to see a specialist to actually treat visible veins.\r\n\r\nIf you’re wondering how to get rid of spider veins for good, know that Dr. Hollingsworth says those wacky home remedies won’t work. Dry brushing? Nope. Fancy body lotions? Nah. Massage? It might feel good, but there won’t be a visible difference.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing really that you can do aside from the small minimally invasive treatments we have that is going to make spider veins look any better,” he says. “Creams, ointments, or rubbing aren’t going to make spider veins go away.”\r\n\r\nThe primary way that spider and varicose veins are treated is by using different surgical methods to close off the vein so that it collapses and the residual scar tissue stops the blood flow completely. These are all superficial veins, so other healthy veins just take over their circulation duties and the procedure won’t impact your overall health. Also, those with more serious, bulging varicose veins can have them removed completely once the vein is closed off.\r\n\r\nSclerotherapy: This is one of the more popular options for spider veins and varicose veins. A doctor injects a foamy detergent or concentrated saltwater solution into the problematic vein, which irritates the walls of the blood vessel, explains Neil Sadick, M.D., founder of Sadick Dermatology. This causes scar tissue to form, which leads the blood vessel to close. If someone is allergic to the sclerotherapy solution, there are other treatment options.\r\n\r\nLaser treatment: A vein surgeon or dermatologist might use a laser treatment to heat the vein, causing it to contract and scar over. Dr Hollingsworth uses a handheld Nd:YAG laser (the same machine that can be used in laser hair removal) on small spider veins. Or, if it’s a larger varicose vein, a laser may be inserted into the vein using a catheter to stop blood flow.\r\n\r\nMedical glue: For varicose veins, doctors might also use is the medical version of superglue. “Cyanoacrylate glue is a biologic glue that’s very similar to Krazy Glue,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. Surgeons close off a varicose vein by gluing it shut from the inside. “You inject it, wait for the glue to set, and move further down, and so on and so on.”\r\n\r\nRadio frequency ablation (RFA): This is another option for varicose veins that are so large that glue and sclero just float away. “RFA runs radio frequency through the inside of the vein and turns the inside of the vein into a lightbulb filament, heats it up, scars it, and kills it,” says Dr. Hollingsworth.\r\n\r\nTo prevent visible veins from getting worse, a surgeon might use RFA or internal laser techniques to close off a larger vein deeper in the leg that feeds the smaller varicose veins and spider veins. “There’s a central pipe in the leg called the saphenous vein; it’s the main superficial vein. Coming off those veins are truncal varicose veins,” Dr. Sadick says. Once the larger vein is taken care of, the smaller veins can be treated with sclerotherapy, glue, or a handheld laser.\r\n\r\nAll of these treatments are performed through tiny punctures in the skin, so you can likely schedule your procedure in the morning and go back to work in the afternoon. However, Dr. Barba warns about getting these treatments on darker skin tones, especially laser and RFA procedures, because those with darker skin tones have a higher risk for hyperpigmentation issues following the treatments. Plus, those pigmentation issues can be stubborn to treat. “Sometimes the pigmentation is a part of the healing process,” Dr. Barba says. “If you care about a little spider vein, you might care about the pigment that’s going to be there for a couple months.”\r\n\r\nWhatever treatment you go with, the key is to go to a doctor who specializes in vein treatments, whether that’s a dermatologist or a vein surgeon. “If you want have anything done, go to whoever does a lot of it,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. The good news is that insurance will cover many vein treatments. Without insurance, these treatments can cost $300 to $8,000. “Oftentimes, when it is a deeper vein problem, insurance covers it because it\'s not [just] a cosmetic issue,” Dr. Barba says.\r\n\r\nHow can you prevent spider veins from coming back?\r\n\r\nAlthough effective, all of these surgical treatments are really temporary fixes, Dr. Hollingsworth says. Spider and varicose veins can return in other nearby veins once the original veins are closed off or removed. So, if you decide not to treat them at all, they can multiply, Dr. Hollingsworth says. But if you stay on top of them—which will require repeated treatments every one to two years—you can keep them at bay.\r\n\r\nAfter treatment, one thing you can do to effectively prevent spider veins from returning is to wear compression stockings daily, which can be difficult to get on and uncomfortable to wear. \"Nobody likes wearing them,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. But, “if you wear stockings religiously during the day, they significantly reduce [the chance that] your spider veins [will come] back.” In some cases, your health insurance may actually cover the cost of medical-grade compression stockings, Medline Plus explains, so check with them before buying any.\r\n\r\nUltimately, if you’re dealing with spider veins or varicose veins, it’s important to check in with a doctor or dermatologist. They can help you understand how serious your particular issue is, talk about what may underlying issues may have caused it, and, if necessary, walk you through your treatment options.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:21:21', '2021-05-28 19:21:23', '/resources/images/wps9.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/spider-and-varicose-veins', 0, 0);

You’re probably not imagining it. Not only is it becoming offensively hot and humid this summer, but we’re also wearing masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19—both of which may contribute to acne and other skin issues.\r\n\r\nBreakouts, in particular, have become so common that mask acne has been dubbed “maskne” on the internet. While you can’t ditch the mask, there are steps you can take to prevent and treat mask-related acne to enjoy a safe summer with healthy skin.\r\n\r\nWhat causes mask acne?\r\n\r\nAcne usually develops when pores get clogged by oil, dead skin cells, makeup, dirt, or bacteria. This can lead to blackheads, whiteheads, or pimples that can vary in size and type, depending on how infected they get.\r\n\r\nAdopting a simple skin-care routine—including cleansing, exfoliating, moisturizing, and wearing sunscreen—helps manage acne because it helps with the skin’s natural shedding process. Regular cleansing and exfoliating ensures that all that gunk and dead skin cells are removed rather than clogging your pores. Moisturizing and wearing sunscreen helps ensure the skin’s protective outer layer functions properly.\r\n\r\nBut wearing a face mask can interfere with that process. Instead of those dead skin cells shedding “throughout the day, they now get clogged in your pores,” Carrie L. Kovarik, M.D., an associate professor of dermatology at University of Pennsylvania and a member of the American Association of Dermatology’s (AAD) COVID-19 task force, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nMasks also provide the perfect humid environment for bacteria to grow in our skin, which can lead to a breakout, Noelani Gonzalez, M.D., director of cosmetic dermatology at Mount Sinai, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nHow can you treat mask acne?\r\n\r\nIf you’re dealing with an active mask acne breakout there are ways to treat it—and the methods aren’t so different from the way you’d treat regular acne.\r\n\r\nFor milder cases, classic over-the-counter acne-fighting ingredients like benzoyl peroxide (which kills the bacteria associated with acne) and salicylic acid (a chemical exfoliant that helps unclog pores, should be your go-tos, Dr. Gonzalez says. You can try using a benzoyl peroxide-containing spot treatment, such as Neutrogena On-the-Spot Acne Treatment ($6, Amazon) or La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Acne Treatment ($30, Amazon). And for salicylic acid products, look for gentle acne cleansers, such as Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser ($11, Ulta) or First Aid Beauty Acne Clearing Charcoal Cleanser ($24, Dermstore).\r\n\r\nBut for more severe acne, meaning it’s inflamed or you’re dealing with deep, cystic pimples, a dermatologist might prescribe other treatments such as anti-inflammatory cortisone creams or retinoid medications, which speed up the skin’s natural cell turnover process.\r\n\r\nHowever, both prescription and over-the-counter acne remedies can be irritating, especially if you have sensitive skin or you’re also dealing with raw, red, inflamed areas of skin. In these cases, a dermatologist may recommend you use acne treatments less frequently or hold off on treating the acne altogether until the raw areas of your skin heals. So the right treatment for you may depend on the exact type of problem you develop and your skin type.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve tried over-the-counter options without success, then it’s best to check in with a board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Gonzalez says. Many dermatologists are now offering video consultations as well.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to prevent mask acne?\r\n\r\nSince we’re going to be wearing masks for a while, managing mask acne isn’t going to be a one-time deal. It will require developing both treatment and ongoing prevention habits to keep your skin clear. And, because mask-related acne doesn’t just affect those who tend to be more acne-prone in general, dermatologists recommend that everyone practice good mask-wearing hygiene.\r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nThe first step is to choose a mask that allows your skin (and you) to breathe while also protecting others and yourself from the spread of coronavirus. To accomplish that, the mask should sit snugly but comfortably on your face and should cover both your mouth and nose, SELF explained previously.\r\n\r\n“I recommend soft fabrics, something like cotton or silk,” Dr. Gonzalez says. “They are materials that tend to be more gentle and breathable on the skin, versus synthetic materials that tend to be harsher on the skin.” Here are a few cloth masks to check out as well as recommendations for those looking to work out in a mask.\r\n\r\nAfter choosing a well-fitting mask that doesn’t irritate your skin, it’s time to think about what you put under it. Choosing skin care and makeup products that are labeled non-comedogenic or oil-free underneath the mask can help reduce chances of breakouts. But Dr. Gonzalez suggests avoiding makeup under your mask entirely—especially heavy foundations and multiple layers of products, which can clog pores and lead to acne.\r\n\r\nInstead, wear a moisturizer with at least SPF 30, Dr. Gonzalez says. Not only will this protect your skin from UV rays, but wearing sunscreen can also help prevent other mask-related skin issues, such as tan lines. And the moisturizing helps reduce friction and chafing.\r\n\r\nAfter a long day of wearing your mask, use a gentle cleanser to wash your face to remove all the accumulated debris and oil, Dr. Kovarik says. But dry skin is another common face mask-related skin issue, so make sure to moisturize immediately after washing your face. Kovarik recommends using a moisturizer with ceramides, which help lock moisture into your skin, and/or hyaluronic acid, which has a hydrating effect.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re thinking about adding anything new to your daily skin-care routine, Dr. Gonzalez recommends against starting any new harsh treatments for your skin. Adding products like harsh chemical peels can make the skin more sensitive “and should be avoided because that’ll make your skin more prone to breaking out,” she says.\r\n\r\nHow to wash your mask:\r\n\r\nYour face isn’t the only thing you need to wash! In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend washing cloth masks after each use, which helps remove oils and dead skin that collect inside the mask. To do so, use warm water and a gentle detergent that doesn’t irritate the skin.\r\n\r\nLook for detergents that are free of added colors and fragrances, which are common skin irritants, Dr. Kovarik says. This will ensure that you’re being gentle on sensitive or irritated skin and will reduce the chances of developing a reaction like contact dermatitis.\r\n\r\nAcne isn’t the only mask-related skin issue you might experience.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other skin issues that may arise during the summer of face masks. For instance, you may need to take extra care with your lips to prevent irritation. Unless you have a cone-shaped mask, “the lips are going to be the first thing your mask is going to touch,” Dr. Kovarik says. She recommends using a lip balm or Vaseline ($9 for a pack of 3, Amazon) to protect them.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you have a skin condition like rosacea or eczema, the irritation from face masks may trigger your symptoms. To manage that, definitely keep up the treatment plan that your dermatologist recommended for you, but get in touch with your derm if that plan is no longer enough to manage the flares.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:21:39', '2021-05-28 19:21:37', '/resources/images/wps10.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/mask-acne', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (125, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Back Acne for Good', 'And when to talk to a dermatologist.', '![img](/resources/images/wps11.png) \r\n\r\nFace acne is a common—and frustrating—skin condition to manage. And figuring out how to get rid of back acne is no different. For some people, back acne causes small pimples, while others deal with large cystic acne zits, which can be deep, painful, and pus-filled. And because back acne can be caused by external factors, particularly working out and wearing sweaty clothes, it can be stubborn to treat with the usual acne remedies—even if they work for the pimples on your face.\r\n\r\nSo what actually is back acne? And how can you treat it effectively? Here’s what you need to know about how to get rid of back acne for good.\r\n\r\nWhat causes back acne?\r\n\r\n“Acne is caused by increased oil production, bacteria, pore blockage, and irregular skin cell turnover,” board-certified dermatologist Eric Meinhardt, M.D., tells SELF, and that goes for your face and your back. Sebaceous glands in the skin produce oil, which can collect along with dead skin cells in the pores, plugging them up and giving bacteria a perfect breeding ground, all of which can lead to redness, whiteheads, blackheads, and sometimes infection.\r\n\r\nHormones can play a large role, which is why you might break out more around your period, for instance. And if you’ve noticed that your breakouts pop up in similar places as it does for other family members, that could signal that your acne has a hereditary component, Dr. Meinhardt says.\r\n\r\nWhile the root causes of zits are basically the same in both places, the skin on your face is very different from the skin on your back, which has its upsides and downsides. The skin on the face has more blood supply, Dr. Meinhardt says, which helps acne heal faster and reduces scarring. But the skin on the back is much thicker than the skin on the face (specifically the second layer, called the dermis). That means that the back is more resilient and can handle stronger treatments, scrubs, and exfoliants that would be considered too harsh for the face.\r\n\r\nHowever, not everything that looks like acne on your back is actually acne. For instance, so-called fungal acne tends to appear on the back and chest area and forms uniform red bumps. But traditional acne treatments won’t help manage it at all. So if you’re not sure what your issue really is, get checked out by a professional.\r\n\r\nHow can you treat—and prevent—back acne?\r\n\r\nTreating back acne can be a challenge, but there are some straightforward steps you can take at home that will help manage it, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). Here’s how to get rid of back acne for good:\r\n\r\nLook for benzoyl peroxide. Of all the over-the-counter acne medication options you have, the AAD suggests starting with benzoyl peroxide. This ingredient works by killing bacteria that fuel acne. The AAD recommends using a wash containing benzoyl peroxide by letting it sit on your skin for two to five minutes in the shower daily and then rinsing it off. They also suggest starting with a concentration of 5.3% and only going higher than that if a lower concentration isn’t enough. Although the skin on your back isn’t as sensitive as the skin on your face, high concentrations of benzoyl peroxide can cause side effects, so it’s still smart to start at a lower level and work your way up only if needed.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nPaula’s Choice Clear Extra Strength Daily Skin Clearing Treatment, $19, Amazon\r\n\r\nSLMD BP Body Wash, $35, Target\r\n\r\nPanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash 10%, $11, Target\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nTry a retinoid. Retinoids, particularly adapalene, are another great OTC option for treating acne. They work by speeding up the skin’s natural cell turnover process, which helps unclog pores and resolve acne more quickly. “Retinoids not only treat the acne you have today, they also change the way the cells turn over, reducing your development of acne tomorrow,” Heidi Waldorf, M.D., the director of laser and cosmetic dermatology at the Mount Sinai Hospital, tells SELF. These are especially effective when used alongside benzoyl peroxide, the AAD says. To make sure you don’t miss a spot when applying topical creams and gels, Waldorf recommends using an applicator like the L’applique to help you reach those hard-to-get-to areas.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nDifferin Gel, $15, Amazon\r\n\r\nLa Roche Posay Effaclar Adapalene Gel 0.1%, $30, Amazon\r\n\r\nAcne Free Adapalene Gel 0.1%, $12, Amazon\r\n\r\nSalicylic acid might work too. This classic acne-fighting ingredient works as a chemical exfoliant, breaking down dead skin cells and getting deep into pores to clear them out. It’s a common ingredient in spot treatments, but those might be hard to use on your back. “Salicylic acid is attracted to the oil in the sebaceous glands, and once there, it helps to loosen the sticky cells and oil to clear clogged hair follicles,” Dr. Waldorf says.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nNeutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, $7, Target\r\n\r\nMurad Acne Body Wash, $44, Murad\r\n\r\nDermaologica Clearing Skin Wash, $62, Ulta\r\n\r\nDevelop good workout habits. Working out and sweating can contribute to body acne, so it’s important to be mindful when you’re engaging in those activities. The AAD recommends opting for looser fitting clothes made of sweat-wicking fabric or cotton to avoid sweat accumulating next to your skin. It’s also important to change out of sweaty workout clothes as soon as possible and to wash them after every use.\r\n\r\nBe gentle with your skin. If your skin has acne, it will require a gentle touch. That means using a gentle body wash or cleanser—not a harsh scrub. It also means avoiding the very tempting urge to pick your acne as much as possible.\r\n\r\nWear sunscreen. Sun exposure can actually worsen acne and cause post-acne dark spots to become darker. Although wearing sunscreen is always important, it’s especially important if you’re trying to manage back acne. Look for products that are non-comedogenic and oil-free, which means they won’t contribute to clogged pores.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nEltaMD UV Lotion Broad-Spectrum SPF 30, $36, Dermstore\r\n\r\nHawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch Lotion Sunscreen SPF 50, $19, Amazon\r\n\r\nClinique Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Mineral Sunscreen For Body, $32, Sephora\r\n\r\nAvoid anything that rubs your skin. The friction caused by a backpack or or shoulder bag can worsen acne, especially if you’re also sweaty. If you can, hold your purse in your hand or rest the strap on your arm.\r\n\r\nTake care when washing your hair. The way you wash your hair can have an impact on bacne. While the oils in hair treatments might be good for nourishing your strands, they can be bad news for the skin on your back. That’s why Debbie Palmer, D.O., tells SELF that you should rinse conditioner off to the side instead of letting it run down your back. Also, try waiting until you’ve completed all of your hair treatments before washing your body. That way you can wash off any oily residue, clearing the way for your acne treatments to do their thing.\r\n\r\nWhen should you see a dermatologist for back acne?\r\n\r\nYou can probably treat mild to moderate back acne at home with over-the-counter options. But if your acne is more severe, meaning you have deep, painful cysts, you should see a dermatologist for help. They may prescribe stronger medications, like prescription retinoids, that can help clear your acne.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not sure if your acne is actually acne, you should also see your dermatologist. There are other skin conditions, including “fungal acne,” that can look a lot like regular acne but that require more specialized treatments.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:25:22', '2021-05-28 19:25:23', '/resources/images/wps11.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/how-to-get-rid-of-back-acne', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (126, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Tan Lines—Without Any More Sun Exposure', 'You don\'t need to risk more sun!', '![img](/resources/images/wps12.png)\r\n\r\nWhen you get home from a long day in the sun, your first instinct might be to figure out how to get rid of those tan lines you accidentally picked up. Of course, you were wearing sunscreen and covering up as much as possible, but even those of us most dedicated to sun safety slip up every once in a while—and pay the price in sun damage and annoying tan lines.\r\n\r\nYou might assume that, to even out your skin tone, you need to get back in the sun or into a tanning bed. But that will only expose you to even more sun damage—and there are plenty of ways to get rid of tan lines without that. In fact, as SELF explained previously, tanning is the direct result of UV exposure to the skin. Over time, that kind of UV exposure can lead to more permanent damage to the skin as well as skin cancer, the CDC says.\r\n\r\nSo, while it’s understandable that you’d want to address the cosmetic concerns of tan lines, it’s important not to use intentional tanning—indoor or outdoor—to do that. Below, check out how to get rid of tan lines with a few safer tips. Not only will your skin tone even out, but your skin might also feel smoother, more moisturized, and more nourished after taking on some of these tips.\r\n\r\n1. Wear sunscreen.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to lighten a tan or even out your skin tone, sunscreen is undoubtedly the most important part of your skin-care arsenal. Wearing sunscreen every day—yes, every single day—will help protect you from UV damage and therefore prevent the parts of your skin that are already tan from continuing to get tan.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nLa Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Milk Sunscreen SPF 100 ($25, Amazon)\r\n\r\nCOOLA Mineral Body Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 ($32, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nBanana Boat Simply Protect Sensitive Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50+ ($8, Target)\r\n\r\n2. Gently exfoliate.\r\n\r\nExfoliating your skin helps remove the outer layer of dead skin cells so that the newer, smoother skin cells underneath are revealed. You can do this with a physical exfoliant, like a scrub, or with a chemical exfoliant, a product containing something like glycolic acid or lactic acid. Over time, this will help your tan to fade, and it’s an important step before using a self-tanner, if that’s something you’re interested in. But be careful not to do this too often because exfoliating with products like these can irritate those with dry or sensitive skin.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nGlytone Exfoliating Body Wash ($32, Amazon)\r\n\r\nPaula’s Choice Weightless Body Treatment 2% BHA ($28, Paula’s Choice)\r\n\r\nShea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Skin Renewal Recipe Body Scrub ($11, Ulta)\r\n\r\n3. Moisturize and use self-tanner.\r\n\r\nAfter exfoliating in the shower, dry off well and load your fave moisturizer onto the already tanned areas to help create a barrier for when you apply the self-tanner. Then dip a makeup sponge into a quality self-tanning gel and blend color evenly into the paler skin; hang tight until it feels dry. You can use a self-tanning cream, but I like gel because it\'s easier to apply on smaller areas of skin. Repeat the exfoliate, lotion, tan routine daily until lines aren\'t noticeable.\r\n\r\nLung Cancer: Myth Vs.

Use body makeup.\r\n\r\nIf you’d prefer to cover your tan lines, try using body makeup. First, take off any clothes near tan lines to avoid staining your clothes and missing major areas. Then dip your index finger into a matte liquid bronzer or body foundation and tap a thin layer over the pale spots. Give it 15 seconds or so to dry, then reassess. If you need to go darker, add another layer. Once you nail your skin tone, gently sweep a bronzing powder over the entire area to help blend the faux with the glow, and finish with a spritz of makeup setting spray.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nDermablend Leg and Body Makeup ($34, Ulta)\r\n\r\nKKW Beauty Skin Perfecting Body Foundation ($45, Ulta)\r\n\r\nDior Backstage Face & Body Foundation ($40, Sephora)\r\n\r\n5. Try body products with vitamin C.\r\n\r\nIf those methods aren’t enough for you, you can also try using body products containing ingredients like vitamin C and niacinamide, which can help lighten hyperpigmentation. These are ingredients commonly used in skin-care products for the face aimed at reducing hyperpigmentation and just overall evening out skin tone. However, they generally take a few weeks to see a noticeable difference.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nM-61 Vitablast C Body Butter ($24, bluemercury)\r\n\r\nOne Love Organics Vitamin C Body Oil ($58, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nAveeno Positively Radiant Body Lotion ($28, Amazon)\r\n\r\n6. Wait it out.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get rid of tan lines is to just wait for them to naturally fade on their own while avoiding sun exposure as much as possible. In fact, your skin cells are constantly in a state of turning over, meaning the newer cells are pushed to the surface as the older skin cells die and flake off. So it’s estimated that, within about 7 to 10 days, your tan will fade significantly—as long as you’re not reexposing the skin to UV light.\r\n\r\nHow to prevent tan lines in the future:\r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent annoying tan lines in the future is to avoid getting a tan at all. That requires wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 anytime you’re exposed to the sun. But it also means trying to stay in the shade as much as possible, wearing clothing that covers your skin (and maybe even contains extra sun protection), and not spending extended time outdoors when the sun is at its strongest.\r\n\r\nTan lines certainly aren’t the most dangerous effect of sun exposure, but they can be annoying—and a sign that you may need to bump up your sun-safety habits.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:25:57', '2021-05-28 19:25:58', '/resources/images/wps12.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/beauty-how-to-fix-tan-lines', 0, 0);

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to keeping breakouts at a minimum, I have a handful of holy-grail skincare go-tos to help appease my finicky, combination skin. As a person who’s tried to do away with zits since the early days of middle school, I have a pretty clear understanding nowadays of the products that will work for me, from the moment they first touch my face. Since one of my long-term skin goals is to have the flexibility to just wear makeup for funsies instead of out of necessity, locking down an effective skincare routine as a foundation is key.\r\n\r\nAs the foundation of any good skincare routine, cleansing is a must, but finding a good cleanser has been the missing piece of my routine for a while. I typically rotate between a few that do the job, but don’t really check off all the boxes for my skin-care needs, which is why I was so surprised by how instantly I took to Space Wash, the new cleanser from buzzy skin-care brand, Starface.\r\n\r\nI’d become a fast fan of buzzy skin-care brand Starface (which was started by former ELLE beauty editor Julie Schott, who, it must be said, has amazing skin) after discovering how effective their cult-favorite Hydro-Stars were. The stars are the brand’s first- and best-sellers, hydrocolloid pimple patches in the shape of—you guessed it—stars, that make even the act of healing zits look cute, and their first-ever cleanser is similarly well-suited for my combination and acne-prone skin.\r\n\r\nSome cleansers have stung my eyes mid-wash, smelled overly perfumed, or left my skin feeling super tight and uncomfortable, but Space Wash is different—this cleanser truly gets me. Formulated with soothing ingredients like sage leaf and calendula flower extract, as well as white willow bark extract to help exfoliate skin, this cleanser has rewarded me with clarity and smoothness every time I use it. It has a barely-there scent with no added fragrance, feels very gentle on my skin, and doesn’t leave behind a sticky residue once it’s rinsed off. Not to mention, it’s comedogenic, dermatologist-tested, oil-free, and vegan.\r\n\r\nAfter rinsing my face, I squirt a nickel-size amount of the cleanser in one palm, add a hint of water, then rub my hands together to form a light, frothy lather. Space Wash is extra silky when I massage it on my face, and once it’s rinsed off, my skin feels clean but not stripped, a common characteristic of other acne-friendly cleansers I’ve used in the past. Not only is its formula absolutely everything for my skin, but the vibrant Space Wash tube (like all Starface products) is one of the best-looking beauty products on my shelf, and also completely recyclable once I’m done with it, which means it’s better for the environment, too.\r\n\r\nI’m so into this cleanser, that at this rate, I’m at a danger of overdoing it on my face washing routine. But if I do get a little heavy handed, I’m lucky that the product is also pretty affordable at $16 a tube and available for auto-refills, which I have to wager that you’ll want to do.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:26:20', '2021-05-28 19:26:21', '/resources/images/wps13.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/starface-space-wash-cleanser-review', 0, 0);

But others are finding themselves battling breakout after breakout, Carol Cheng, M.D., assistant clinical professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the Acne Procedure Clinic at UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, tells SELF. “I’ve seen it go both ways,” she says, “and I can see a number of reasons why.”\r\n\r\nWhether your skin is getting better these days or…not, here’s what might be behind those changes.\r\n\r\nThere are tons of factors that could be affecting your skin right now—for better or worse.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to remember that some acne triggers aren’t going to change right now, Dr. Cheng says, such as the hormonal influence on skin and acne. But here are a few things that might be making a difference on your skin.\r\n\r\nStress, sleep, diet. People’s skin may respond to things like changes in stress, diet, and sleep in different ways, and we don’t totally understand why, Dr. Cheng says. But if you notice that your skin is behaving badly right now, it makes sense that it might have something to do with these other big changes in your environment and behavior right now.\r\n\r\nUsing fewer skin-care products. “Part of what’s helping people is they are cleaning up their routine,” Mary L. Stevenson, M.D., assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. Not having to go into an office every day is giving us the freedom to cut back on our skin-care regimens and really take the time to be thoughtful about what we’re putting on our face—perhaps we’re even doing it over the course of a morning rather than in 30 seconds before rushing out the door!\r\n\r\nFor some, that minimalism might make them realize they didn’t actually need all those products and that some of them might have even been making their skin break out or irritated. But some of us really do rely on those products to keep our skin calm and clear, Dr. Stevenson says, so taking a break could have a detrimental effect on our skin.\r\n\r\nWorking out at home. If you, like many of us, have gone from working out at your favorite gym or studio class to exclusively working out at home, that could also be having an effect on your skin, Dr. Stevenson says. At home you have time to take off your makeup, you’re not working out in the same room as 25 other sweaty people, and you can clean off all that sweat immediately after you’re done rather than waiting a full subway ride to shower at home. Having that much newfound control over your fitness environment could lead to overall less irritated and less acne-prone skin.\r\n\r\nWearing less makeup. As with skin care, a lot of us are finding that there’s less of a need to wear makeup daily because we’re leaving home so much less often. Personally, outside of the occasional Zoom call, I basically don’t wear any makeup these days, and my skin has been pretty into it. That could be because the products I was wearing are irritating, or it could just be the simple fact of not having an extra layer of stuff on top of my skin helps prevent acne. “The most irritating thing we do is too much,” Dr. Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nSitting in front of screens constantly. Yes, if you are prone to hyperpigmentation, the blue light from your devices might exacerbate that, SELF explained previously. But the bigger risk of sitting idly in front of your laptop, phone, tablet, et cetera for hours on end is that you’re more likely to absent-mindedly pick at or touch your face, Dr. Cheng says, which can contribute to acne and interfere with the skin’s normal healing process.\r\n\r\nWearing face masks. If you’ve been wearing a face mask when in public (which, yes, you should be), you’ve probably noticed how quickly it can get hot and sweaty under there. You may have also noticed that you’re getting acne in the areas of your face that are under the mask. That could be thanks to acne mechanica, Dr. Cheng says, which is caused by something physically trapping that warmth and sweat on your skin.\r\n\r\nTake this opportunity to work on your relationship with your skin.\r\n\r\nOne of the few, tiny silver linings of having this time at home is being able to take the opportunity to more closely monitor your skin and how your products affect it, Dr. Stevenson says. But it’s also important to recognize when you’re paying too much attention to your skin, which can be especially difficult right now if you deal with OCD or a body-focused repetitive disorder that involves skin picking.\r\n\r\nIn general, Dr. Stevenson recommends checking in on your skin at three points during the day: when you wake up, when you get home from work, and before you go to bed. Right now, obviously, many of us don’t get home from work, we just are home and also working. So the blurring of that line can be a little difficult to navigate. It might require you to pick a time when your work day is usually over. Still, try to take those moments—and only those moments—throughout the day to tune in to your skin. And, as SELF explained previously, setting time limits like this is one crucial strategy to managing skin-fueled OCD symptoms.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it’s completely understandable that, with so many changes in our lives, our skin might be going through some changes too. And, for most of us, the changes will be relatively minor and easy to manage with our usual acne- and irritation-fighting strategies. But if your skin changes are causing extra stress or you don’t know what’s causing those changes, it’s worth checking in with a dermatologist about what you can do to deal with them.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:26:40', '2021-05-28 19:26:47', '/resources/images/wps14.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/skin-changes', 0, 0);

She also can\'t play sports, a restriction that causes difficulties for her physical education. \"My P.E. teachers are always trying to convince me to cut my nails...They’ll never succeed in convincing me—but that makes my grades in P.E. really bad,\" she says.\r\n\r\nAnd as wild as it is to imagine life with six-inch nails, seeing the actual sight is just as surprising.\r\n\r\nAccording to Simone, a lot of precautions are required to keep her nails in shape. She has to shower and dress with extra care not to snag anything, and to strengthen her nails, she uses two coats of nail hardener and cuticle oil every time she paints them. In total, she goes through at least two bottles of nail-varnish remover, cuticle oil, and hand cream monthly. Hopefully Simone won\'t need contact lenses in the near future.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:03:11', '2021-05-28 19:03:13', '/resources/images/wps2.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/teen-with-six-inch-nails', 0, 0);

It looks like a magical dust that transforms into an even coat of paint. But it\'s completely different from nail polish. A regular manicure can chip immediately after you leave the salon, but most dip-powder manicures claim to last up to three weeks longer than gel manicures. So when my nail tech asked if I wanted to try it out, I was down. But I found out that it isn\'t a new technique at all, dip powder has actually been around since the ‘80s.\r\n\r\nThe name dip powder basically explains the process. First, a base coat is applied, and the nail is dipped into a powder. The process is repeated a couple of times depending on how many coats you want. Then, the rough, powdery layers are transformed into a smooth, glossy finish once a sealant is applied. The best part: You don\'t have to worry about the possibility of skin damage from UV lamps. Unlike the classic gel manicure, it dries instantly. And the powders don\'t pose any inhalation threats, according to chemist Doug Schoon, president of Schoon Scientific + Regulatory Consulting and co-chair of Nail Manufacturer’s Council. That\'s why it\'s being marketed with words like \"safe,\" \"natural,\" and \"organic.\" However those claims aren\'t regulated, and choosing the powders over gel manis isn\'t necessarily a better choice.\r\n\r\nRelated: If You Get Gel Manicures, This Is What You Need To Know About UV Lamps And Skin Cancer\r\n\r\nIn fact, gel manicures, dip powders, and traditional nail extensions have more in common than you think. They are all made up of an acrylic base. \"All of the ingredients used to make any type of artificial nail—whether they be glued, cured by UV, or mixed with a liquid and powder—are based on the acrylic family,\" Schoon says.\r\n\r\nSo, how do dip powders differ from acrylic nails and gel manicures? The grains are finer, which allows them to be created in more vibrant colors. Dip powders are bonded using a glue called cyanoacrylate, which is also the main ingredient in Krazy Glue. \"Acrylic nails\", on the other hand, are applied by combining a liquid with a powder to form a gel. Similarly, the ingredients in gel manicures are like pre-mixed acrylics, and they undergo a chemical reaction once they are cured with a UV lamp.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRelated: What Your Nails Can Tell You About Your Health\r\n\r\nSo, in theory they are all the same. But that doesn\'t mean that they are all bad for your nails. Schoon says that you could wear acrylics for years without harming your nails. You\'ll only see problems if the application, maintenance, or removal techniques are done incorrectly. That\'s why it\'s important to find a salon that doesn\'t rush during the removal process. The dip-powder manicures soak off just like gel manis but can take longer. \"One thing that people don’t understand is that if it says soak for fifteen minutes to remove, that’s the minimum time,\" Schoon says. And the longer you leave the acrylics on, the longer it will take to soak them off. \"It may be fifteen minutes if you take them off the same day, but if you wait two weeks or four weeks, it could take thirty minutes.\" The last thing you want to do is scrape off layers of your nails, so it\'s worth it to be patient. And there is no such thing as gently scraping. \"That\'s like saying I punched you gently in the nose,\" Schoon says.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to reserve dip powder and other acrylic-based manicures for special occasions. \"This may be great as a one time use when you want stronger nails,\" says celebrity nail stylist Elle. The acrylics will create a hard surface on your nails while you\'re wearing them. So, find a technician that won\'t rush through any steps, and one that can talk to you about how to properly take care of your nails in between appointments.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:12:14', '2021-05-28 19:12:17', '/resources/images/wps6.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/dip-powder-nail-polish-manicures', 0, 0);

But, she recently revealed, those manis come at a price. Rushmore-Perrin told the Daily Mail that she’s been getting acrylics for six years. She says she has them done professionally and usually has them removed by professionals, but she recently didn’t have time to visit the salon and decided to DIY. “One nail had come off, and I didn’t want to have nine nails on, so I started peeling and snapping them off,” she said. “I then soaked the remains off in acetone.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that didn’t end well. Rushmore-Perrin posted a photo on Twitter of her torn, cracked, and bleeding nails after she removed her acrylic manicure herself. In another tweet, she said the pain was excruciating. “Nearly cried in the shower at the hot water touching my nail beds and I\'m pretty sure there\'s still loads of shampoo left in my hair,\" she replied to the tweet. “Don’t even care how they look, it’s the physical PAIN dear lord.”\r\n\r\nRushmore-Perrin posted another photo of her much healthier-looking nails less than a week afterward. “Five days later, after taking two different kinds of biotin every day,” she captioned the photo. “Still not amazing or beautiful, but LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, biotin is necessary for the formation of fatty acids and glucose, which fuel the body. Biotin is also a B vitamin that helps provide the necessary building blocks for healthy hair and nail production, Joshua Zeichner, M.D., a New York City-based board-certified dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Rushmore-Perrin\'s case, doctors doubt biotin helped repair her nails. Your nails are only really alive at the base, Doris Day, M.D., a clinical associate professor of dermatology at the New York University Langone Medical Center, tells SELF. By the time nails grow beyond the cuticle, they’re just dead cells, similar to your hair. Therefore, any potential benefits from biotin supplements will be seen from the base on up, which is why Gary Goldenberg, M.D., medical director of the Dermatology Faculty Practice at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells SELF that although biotin is helpful in the development and growth of nails, it can take six to 12 months for people to see results. Day is skeptical Rushmore-Perrin\'s progress is due to the biotin, adding that the beauty blogger\'s nails likely got better because she stopped putting acrylics on and they had time to heal.\r\n\r\nAngelica Ross Gets a Buzz Cut, Talks Womanhood & Radical Blackness\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt\'s usually not necessary to take biotin for hair and nail benefits because it\'s rare for people to be deficient in biotin, Day says. That means people’s bodies typically make healthy hair and nails just fine without additional supplementation. If you do use a supplement, Zeichner says you won’t see any changes to hair and nails you already have. What you can expect, if your body is deficient in biotin, is new hair and nail growth that\'s potentially stronger and healthier than you\'re used to. Jill Waibel, M.D., founder and owner of The Miami Dermatology and Laser in Institute, tells SELF that biotin has been found to be especially helpful with brittle nails, which makes sense since that\'s a common sign of biotin deficiency.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to keep in mind: Supplements are unregulated and can definitely be dangerous or cause unpleasant side effects (many biotin-supplementing people complain of cystic acne online) if you take too many of them. Instead of popping a supplement, Goldenberg points out that it\'s better to get the vitamin from foods such as avocados, fish, and legumes.\r\n\r\nIf you\'re still intrigued, check in with your doctor or dermatologist—they\'ll be able to determine whether you have some sort of deficiency affecting your nails or hair, then be able to figure out an action plan from there.\r\n', 0, '2021-05-28 19:15:20', '2021-05-28 19:15:17', '/resources/images/wps7.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/biotin-nails-acrylics-repair', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (134, 14, 'What Is Dermaplaning and Should You Try It?', 'Here\'s what experts say you should know.', '![img](/resources/images/wps1-1622200668692.png) \r\n\r\nYou may have seen people on YouTube shaving their faces using small razors to exfoliate their skin or get rid of facial hair and wondered, “What is dermaplaning, and should I try it?”\r\n\r\nWhile those YouTube tutorials may make dermaplaning look like an easy “do it yourself” procedure, experts say you should avoid trying this at home for several reasons that we will explain. Plus, dermaplaning is not recommended for all skin types, so it’s best to consult with a dermatologist about whether it’s right for you. Below, dermatologists explain what you should know about dermaplaning, including the risks, benefits, and cost.\r\n\r\n***\\*What is dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nDermaplaning is a cosmetic procedure that involves scraping your face with a scalpel to remove the e pidermis—your top layer of skin—and small hairs, explains Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D., professor of dermatology, medicine, and nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Traditionally, people have the procedure done in a dermatologist’s office, however, you can find blades at the drugstore marketed for at-home dermaplaning use. That said, it’s safer for a professional to perform this. (We’ll get to all of that in a bit.) It’s also always a good idea to research any procedure you’re interested in, even if you delay the actual procedure itself because of the pandemic. (Here’s more information to help you navigate making medical appointments during COVID-19). \r\n\r\nDuring a dermaplaning session, the dermatologist uses a medical-grade scalpel to scrape across the surface of the skin. The treatment takes about 15 minutes, and it can cost anywhere from $40 to more than $150, depending on where you go.\r\n\r\n***\\*What are the benefits of dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nThe main reason people do it is to remove the vellus hairs on their faces, which some people refer to as peach fuzz. Everyone has these fine vellus hairs coating their bodies, and they serve a purpose: Vellus hairs keep us warm and add another layer of protection to the skin. But some people’s vellus hairs are thicker and more visible than others, and depending on how they feel about that, they might want to have it removed. Of course, dermaplaning is just one way to do that. There are many at-home hair removal kits that may get the job done, including the Glee Face Wax Hair Removal Strips for Women ($9, Walmart.com) that a SELF editor loves. However, dermatologist Rosemarie Ingleton, M.D., tells SELF that typical hair-removal methods like waxing and threading don’t always provide the results people are looking for, which makes dermaplaning an appealing option. You may have heard that shaving hair on your face makes hair grow back thicker—that’s technically not true. But it may look thicker or darker, thanks to having a blunter tip from shaving as it grows out, according to the Mayo Clinic.\r\n\r\nPeople might try laser hair removal for longer-lasting results, according to Jeanine Downie, M.D., a dermatologist in New Jersey. This method damages the hair follicles using heat, so your strands don’t grow back as easily. Although it is marketed as a permanent option, your hair may grow back after any hormonal changes (like menopause), according to the Cleveland Clinic. It also takes several sessions to see changes. The exact amount varies, and generally, people with dark skin need more sessions compared to people with light skin. This option also doesn’t work on gray hairs.\r\n\r\nDr. Ingleton says that the biggest reason she does dermaplaning in her practice is to remove vellus hairs, but that the blade also gets rid of a superficial layer of dead skin. This can make your skin look brighter, help your skin-care products sink in better, and make your foundation go on smoother. In Dr. Ingleton’s practice, dermaplaning is often an add-on done before other treatments like microdermabrasion or ablative lasers like Fraxel. When it comes to exfoliating, there are no studies showing how dermaplaning compares to other treatments like retinoids or chemical peels, says Dr. Kim. That’s one reason why Dr. Downie prefers to use peels over dermaplaning—even for sensitive skin—and doesn’t offer dermaplaning in her practice. “Peels help to improve texture, tone, acne, and fine lines,” she says. “They are not equivalent at all, and many peels give deeper exfoliation than a scalpel,” Dr. Downie says.\r\n\r\nIs it ok to try dermaplaning at home?\r\n\r\nWhile it might feel like getting rid of these hairs is easy to do at home with an inexpensive blade, professionals warn against it. Any blade you get over-the-counter won’t be as sharp—or as effective—as the medical-grade scalpel used at the office. Also, there’s always the chance you will cut yourself in the process, potentially causing scarring.\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nAnytime a sharp object goes near your face, there is a risk of damage to the skin. Dr. Downie says that she’s seen patients with scarring after a dermaplaning session gone wrong. Although some medical spas offer dermaplaning, Dr. Downie recommends seeing a professional board-certified dermatologist for this kind of procedure. Board certification is an extra certification step that shows a physician completed advanced training in their specialty. (You can find a board-certified specialist by visiting The American Academy of Dermatology website.)\r\n\r\n***\\*How often should you have dermaplaning done?\\****\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the hair away, you might have to get treated about once a month. (Of course, the exact timeline will look different for each person.) Dr. Kim says this is not a treatment you should do too frequently. Our epidermis helps protect us from allergens and other potential irritants in the outside world—dermaplaning too often may irritate or damage that top layer of protection, she says. Again, this is why it’s best to consult with a physician who can help you decide on the appropriate frequency for your skin and needs.\r\n\r\n***\\*When should you avoid dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nThere are a few instances where you should think twice before signing up for dermaplaning. If you have acne, there is a chance that the blade could nick a pimple, says Dr. Downie, which means it would take longer to heal. So if you have something like a serious cystic breakout happening, it might be best to postpone. Ideally, you want to consult with a doctor who has experience with acne-prone patients. Also, tell your dermatologist if you have a history of cold sores. “If you have a breakout of cold sores, you need to be on Valtrex, and the physician ne eds to avoid the area,” says Dr. Downie. Without the use of a preventive oral anti-herpes medication, the cold sores can spread due to microtears in the skin.\r\n\r\n***\\*Is there anything else to know about dermaplaning?\\****\r\n\r\nAfter a dermaplaning treatment, you do need to take care of your skin. “You have to coat your skin with sunblock afterwards because you’re going to be more sensitive to the sun,” says Dr. Downie. “You also have to be cautious of retinol and glycolic acids.” Dermatologists recommend that people with sensitive skin use a light moisturizer like Vanicream ($36, Amazon) because it doesn’t contain fragrances or other irritants. If you do choose to try dermaplaning, just be sure to work with a professional dermatologist for the safest possible experience.\r\n\r\nAll products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (135, 14, 'How to Manage Retinization When Using Retinoids', 'The first month on retinoids can be brutal.', '![img](/resources/images/wps2.png)\r\n\r\nBeauty editors praise retinoids for being a skin-care ingredient that seemingly does it all. They’re powerful enough to decrease acne, pigmentation, and wrinkles. But first comes the retinization period, where you might experience reddened, peeling, and dry skin. During this time, your skin is adjusting to the medication, and let’s not mince words, it sucks.\r\n\r\nIf you previously tried retinoids but thought they weren’t for you because of the side effects, then we have some good news: You can try again if you want. “Almost everyone can use retinoids if you tailor it to yourself,” Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D, professor of Dermatology, Medicine, and Nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, tells SELF. The key is figuring out the right strength and how often you can use it, she says. Even most of her patients with rosacea or sensitive skin can generally use a mild retinoid sparingly, she explains.\r\n\r\nWe spoke to a few experts about what you should know about retinoids and tips to keep in mind.\r\n\r\n1. What are retinoids, and why should you use them?\r\n\r\nThere’s a good chance you’ve heard of “retinols,” and you might be wondering if they are different from retinoids. It’s easiest to think of retinoids as a family of compounds derived from vitamin A, explains Dr. Kim. Then, there are retinols, or a form of retinoids commonly found in over-the-counter skin care products, and retinoic acid, found in prescription medications. But again, these are all forms of vitamin A, which can help your skin cells turn over more quickly when applied topically.\r\n\r\n“It’s very confusing because people just call everything retinols, but there are differences,” says Dr. Kim. The most important thing for you to remember is that retinoic acid requires a prescription and retinols can be found in products at your drugstore. Retin-A, or tretinoin as it’s called generically, is one popular brand of prescription retinoic acid.\r\n\r\nRetinoids may reduce wrinkles because they activate your skin’s natural collagen and elastin (two fibers that keep it strong). They’re also good exfoliators since they force your skin cells to turn over more quickly, which helps reduce acne, says Dr. Kim. In six to eight weeks, retinoids can clear up and prevent acne, reduce the look of fine lines, and lighten hyperpigmentation until it disappears. But prescription retinoids are strong stuff, so your skin is likely to get sensitive and irritated as it gets used to their mechanisms of action. Over-the-counter retinols can cause light irritation, but it\'s less severe since they are formulated to be gentler than prescription options. Because retinols are weaker, you may not notice skin changes, e.g., less acne, for several months, Dr. Kim says.\r\n\r\n2. What is retinization?\r\n\r\nLike we said, retinization is that period where your skin is adjusting to the retinoids. Generally, your skin may feel irritated, dry, and begin peeling, explains Dr. Kim. It starts a few days after you first start applying the medication and can last about a month (give or take a couple weeks) while your skin builds up a tolerance. Even people with sensitive skin can generally use some form of retinoids, says Dr. Kim. However, they might need to try the following skin care strategies to help reduce irritation, especially if using a prescription retinoid. Or, people with sensitive skin may need to try over-the-counter retinols since these are less irritating. Dr. Kim likes Differin Gel ($16, Amazon.com) since it was previously available by prescription and has been well-tested. As with most health concerns, it is best to consult with a dermatologist who can help you develop a plan that works for your specific skin. Right now, many physicians are offering virtual appointments using video chat. (Here’s what you need to know about scheduling medical appointments during COVID-19).\r\n\r\n3. Prepare your skin before starting retinoids.\r\n\r\nThe best prep you can do for your new retinoid regimen is to make sure your face isn’t dehydrated. “Moisturized skin has a better barrier function,” meaning that it’s at peak protection for whatever you throw at it, Beverly Hills dermatologist and founder of SkinxFive Ava Shamban, M.D., tells SELF. She says that means starting on a solid moisturization routine—morning and night—at least a week or so before you begin using the medication.\r\n\r\n4. Apply moisturizer before your retinoid at night.\r\n\r\nLayering the retinoid over a gentle moisturizer will help temper any irritation. Look for a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, ceramides, antioxidants, or redness-relieving peptides. Finding the right moisturizer for your particular skin type isn’t always easy. You can read our guide on moisturizer if you need help finding a product you like. The CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Lotion ($18, Amazon.com) is one dermatologist-recommended pick that works well for combination skin, for instance.\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nNote: The skin around your eyes is extra sensitive, and you shouldn’t apply retinoids to the upper eyelids at the risk of getting product in your eye. Protect the entire eye area with a thick moisturizer before putting retinoids on the rest of your face.\r\n\r\n5. Don’t start by applying retinoids every day.\r\n\r\nRetinoids aren’t something you should apply every day from the start. You have to work your way up to regular use. “Start slowly applying twice per week and then gradually add another day until you have built up tolerance for daily use,” RealSelf dermatologist Michele Green, M.D., tells SELF. If your skin has an adverse reaction, such as excessive peeling, lay off the treatment for a couple days. Then, you can try again but decrease the amount of times you use it per week. For example, if you experienced irritation after using it four times in a week, then bump your frequency down to three and see how your skin reacts. Some people can only tolerate using retinoids about twice a week, explains Dr. Kim.\r\n\r\n6. Change to a simple skin-care routine.\r\n\r\nFor the first month of regular retinoid use, your skin is officially classified as “sensitive.” That means you need to change up your cleansing and exfoliating routine. “Using a gentle detergent cleanser will allow some natural oils to remain on the skin, reducing the likelihood of developing the irritant dermatitis,” says Dr. Shamban. She says to look for something that is cream-based like Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser ($10, Amazon.com).\r\n\r\nAlso give up your masks, peels, and exfoliating scrubs. “Retinol will naturally exfoliate the skin,” says Dr. Shamban. “There is no reason to do any kind of a manual dermabrasion or exfoliating.” Dr. Green adds that you should avoid applying any other skin-care products with retinol, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and glycolic acid as they can be too harsh on your skin during retinization.\r\n\r\n7. Treat dry patches with extra moisturizer.\r\n\r\nDry patches and peeling will likely happen when you use retinoids. Dr. Shamban recommends applying aloe gel or 1 percent hydrocortisone cream like CeraVe Anti-Itch Cream ($9, Amazon.com) during the day to help with flakiness and irritation.\r\n\r\n8. Be patient about your results.\r\n\r\n“In dermatology, people want to do something once and that’s it,” says Dr. Kim. However, she says that you need to be patient and play the long game when it comes to retinoids. “You want to use this for a long time to really see the benefit of what these can do for your skin,” she says. So if a prescription retinoid is irritating, then you may want to use a weaker retinol. Or your doctor may be able to prescribe you a lower-dose retinoid that your skin tolerates.\r\n\r\n9. Call your dermatologist if you’re in pain.\r\n\r\nYes, some redness and itchiness are expected, but if you have an extreme reaction, it needs professional attention. “If your face starts to look like a charred tomato, it’s time to back off and see a physician,” Dr. Shamban says. Dr. Green seconds this sentiment, “If the skin starts to crack and you have open lesions which are oozing, you should definitely stop using the product and see your dermatologist. Also, if you develop a rash, this could mean you are having an allergic reaction to the product.” Again, you may not feel comfortable with physical office visits right now. But your dermatologist may be able to provide care through a virtual session, so it’s worth calling their office to check.\r\n\r\nAdditional reporting by Melissa Matthews\r\n\r\nAll products featured on SELF are independently selected by our editors.

INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (136, 14, '10 Things to Know Before Trying Dermal Fillers', 'Read this before making your appointment.', '![img](/resources/images/wps3.png) \r\n\r\nOur bodies naturally change with age, and those differences might include new wrinkles on our faces or cheekbones that aren’t as high as they once were. Dermal fillers can help minimize these signs of aging if you’re unhappy with them.\r\n\r\nHowever, these changes are completely normal and occur when we lose some of the subcutaneous fat that supports our skin. Over time, the skin on the middle of our faces shifts down too, causing our cheeks to sag a bit, explains Mary Stevenson, M.D., dermatologist at NYU Langone Health. “Filler can be used to help lift and add support,” she tells SELF. It can also help soften wrinkles, Dr. Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nThere are several categories of dermal fillers, and they’re all generally administered in the same way (more on that in a bit). Before electing to have any type of cosmetic or medical procedure, it’s important to understand what the process entails and any potential risks. Understandably, you might also have concerns about visiting a doctor’s office during the pandemic. Our story about making medical appointments during COVID-19 can help you decide if now is the right time to schedule an elective procedure. But below, you’ll find information experts think you should know about dermal fillers\r\n\r\n1. What exactly are dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nFirst things first: Dermal fillers are not to be confused with Botox, injectable drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to smooth lines and wrinkles. The latter \"freezes\" muscles to reduce wrinkles, while dermal fillers are injectable implants approved by the FDA to help smooth skin and wrinkles. As the name implies, they are injected beneath your skin using a needle.\r\n\r\nAccording to the FDA, there are four categories of fillers. Each is named for the type of material they’re made with:\r\n\r\nHyaluronic acid is naturally produced by your body and already found in your skin and cartilage. Generally, fillers made with hyaluronic acid last between 6-12 months.\r\n\r\nCalcium hydroxylapatite is a mineral that is found in our bones. Fillers made with this material last up to 18 months.\r\n\r\nPoly-L-lactic acid is a biodegradable synthetic material that’s also used to make medical products like dissolvable stitches. These fillers may last up to two years.\r\n\r\nPolymethylmethacrylate beads are the only filler that can’t be absorbed by your body, meaning the results are permanent. They’re only used around the mouth.\r\n\r\nHyaluronic acid, which you may recognize as a common ingredient in some skincare products, is one of the most popular types of fillers, explains Jenny Kim, M.D., Ph.D, professor of dermatology, medicine, and nutrition at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Because it helps skin retain moisture, hyaluronic acid can make your face look more plump and hydrated. It\'s also used in lotions as a moisturizer, but no cream can restore lost volume—only injectable hyaluronic acid can do that. Juvéderm and Restylane are two popular name brand hyaluronic fillers that you may have heard of.\r\n\r\n2. How do I know which dermal filler to try?\r\n\r\nA good doctor will explain the ideal treatment plan for you, but know that the most natural-looking results may require more than one type of filler. There are many different brands of fillers within each category, and the products vary in how they should be used—like filling out cheeks—and concentration of the active ingredient, explains Dr. Kim. For example, Restylane, one brand of hyaluronic filler, has five different lines—and each is used for different reasons. \"Restylane Lyft has larger particle sizes—think of them like the bricks of a foundation,\" Whitney Bowe, M.D. a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, tells SELF. Those larger particles have the heft to \"rebuild\" thinned cheekbones, while a smaller particle size, as in Restylane Silk, works better for addressing fine lines and plumping lips.\r\n\r\n3. Why do people get dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nDr. Kim explains that patients come to her saying “they just want to look a little better,” without turning to cosmetic surgery. She uses dermal fillers to add in volume and smooth out wrinkles, which her patients are normally happy with, she says.\r\n\r\nWATCH\r\n\r\nA Dermatologist Explains: Why Getting a Psoriasis Diagnosis Is So Challenging\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nDermal fillers are particularly popular because patients see differences in their appearances before leaving her office, Dr. Kim says. Generally, people notice the desired changes from other non-surgical procedures, like Botox, after a few days.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note: Dermal fillers are not FDA-approved for body contouring procedures. In other words, they shouldn’t be used to increase the size of your breasts or butt.\r\n\r\n4. What precautions should I take before getting fillers?\r\n\r\nIt probably goes without saying, but safety should be your top priority when considering any medical procedure. Dr. Kim says visiting a board-certified dermatologist or a board-certified plastic surgeon is one way to ensure that your physician is experienced. This extra certification step shows that the doctor completed additional training in their particular specialty. (You can find a board-certified specialist by visiting The American Board of Plastic Surgery or the American Academy of Dermatology websites.) Even though dermal fillers are available at medical spas, you should see only licensed and trained physicians for any injectable treatment. There are risks for issues like infection, discoloration, and lumps if injections are done incorrectly.\r\n\r\nGiven that this is a cosmetic procedure, you understandably want to be satisfied with the results. One way to find a doctor whose work you like is by asking friends who have had this done for their recommendations. \"People are starting to be more open about injectables,\" Ava Shamban, M.D., a board-certified dermatologist in Los Angeles, tells SELF.\r\n\r\n5. What should I ask my doctor during the consultation?\r\n\r\n“I think as a patient you should always ask for a consultation first and then really talk about what your goal is and how they [the doctor] can help you,” says Dr. Kim. You may think you just want dermal fillers, but an expert could recommend another treatment—or a combination of treatments—based on your specific skin type and goals. For example, your doctor may suggest using laser therapy if you have a lot of pigmentation, she says.\r\n\r\nDr. Shamban advises requesting before-and-after photographs of real patients from the doctor’s office. Every practitioner has different philosophies, techniques, and levels of experience. And don\'t be afraid to ask about your doctor’s training and certification during the initial consultation.\r\n\r\nLastly, you and your physician should communicate about realistic results and your expectations—it\'s your face, after all.\r\n\r\n6. What are the possible side effects of fillers?\r\n\r\nEven non-surgical procedures have their risks. The most common side effects include bruising, redness, pain, or swelling, all of which should go away within two weeks, according to the FDA. Less frequently, people might get raised bumps under their skin that need to be treated with injections, medications, or even surgically removed, according to the FDA.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is rare, filler can accidentally be injected into a blood vessel and lead to blurred vision or permanent blindness. You should call your doctor or the emergency room if your skin turns blue and you’re in a lot of pain—these are two possible signs that filler is in your bloodstream. Again, this is why you want to see an experienced doctor who is skilled in performing the procedure.\r\n\r\n7. Who should avoid dermal fillers?\r\n\r\nAccording to the FDA, there’s no research showing that dermal fillers are safe for pregnant or breastfeeding people, so you may want to hold off if you’re expecting a baby or recently had a child. And here\'s one more thing to consider: Avoid getting filler right before a teeth cleaning or other dental treatment, Dr. Shamban says. These procedures require pressure and stretching of the face that could potentially misplace fillers. You can ask your doctor for their opinion regarding when it’s safe to get any future dental work during your consultation.\r\n\r\n8. How much do dermal fillers cost?\r\n\r\nIf the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. If you see a deal for inexpensive filler, be skeptical. \"You have to be careful,\" Dr. Shamban says, adding that counterfeit and diluted filler do exist. \"Ask to see the box, and look for a safety seal on it.\" The price of these fillers varies depending on the amount of product needed. In 2019, the average cost of hyaluronic acid fillers was $652 per syringe, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. They estimate that most patients need more than one syringe to achieve the results they’re looking for.\r\n\r\n9. Are dermal fillers permanent?\r\n\r\nIf you\'re unhappy with the way filler looks, don\'t panic—in most cases, you can have it adjusted. A dermatologist might inject additional filler for balance, or they can dissolve it altogether, depending on the type. \"The wonderful thing about hyaluronic acid fillers is that there\'s an enzyme that can be injected into the area to dissolve the product,\" Dr. Shamban says. \"It just goes away.\"\r\n\r\nBut when expertly injected, filler should look natural. \"The changes we can make are so subtle that nobody would notice,\" says Dr. Shamban. \r\n\r\n10. How long will the results last?\r\n\r\nSince the majority of fillers aren’t permanent, you\'ll have to keep going back to the doctor’s office if you love the results following your procedure. After about six months, your body naturally breaks down hyaluronic acid fillers. So, you have to get touch-ups once or twice a year to maintain the look. However, this is good news if you just want to try fillers once or twice, since the effects will fade away without any long-term risks.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:19:50', '2021-05-28 19:19:51', '/resources/images/wps3.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/dermal-fillers', 0, 0);

Whether it’s 100 degrees and humid or pouring rain, I make sure that my face is saturated with a healthy dollop of sun protection before leaving the house. I thought I’d discovered all my skin-care favorites—until I tried Supergoop! Play Everyday Lotion’s updated reef-safe sunscreen formula. \r\n\r\nI already count Supergoop!’s Unseen Sunscreen among my product ride-or-dies, but after emptying my last tube this summer, I decided to venture out of my comfort zone and test Supergoop! Play, which is suitable for both face and body. Typically I’m wary of two-in-one skin products (I don’t fully endorse the idea of body wash that also works for your face, for example). But I was willing to give this a shot because I love Supergoop!—and it didn’t disappoint.\r\n\r\nI totally get why this is called Everyday Lotion, since its consistency is just as creamy and lightweight as some of my favorite moisturizers. Although it goes on white, the sunscreen has an invisible finish once rubbed in, unlike a lot of lotions that leave a chalky cast. It’s nongreasy with a pleasantly mild scent, and my skin drinks this stuff up with little effort. Supergoop! Play\'s chameleon-like ability to work on both my face and body without triggering breakouts is truly a game changer, and I no longer have to bother switching between a bunch of sun-protection products on the regular. \r\n\r\nSince Supergoop! Play offers broad-spectrum SPF 50 protection, plus has a water- and sweat-resistant formula, I don’t worry about it wearing off during outdoor workouts. I can happily wear it in the ocean and actually feel good about it, as it is now officially a reef-safe sunscreen, meaning it doesn’t contain chemical UV filters like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are known to be harmful to coral reefs and other sea life. \r\n\r\nNow that I’ve added this new gold star to my list of skin-care go-tos, I’m ready to graduate from the handheld 2.4-ounce size right to the jumbo, easy-to-pump 18-ounce version.

INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (138, 14, 'Watch Shay Mitchell Get Her First Treatment for Post-Pregnancy Melasma ', 'A week later, she\'s already seeing results.', '![img](/resources/images/wps6.png) \r\n\r\nShay Mitchell, who gave birth to her daughter this past October, recently walked her Instagram followers through her first intense pulsed light therapy (IPL) treatment session. She sought out the treatment to help manage her melasma, a skin condition often associated with pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIn the IGTV post, Mitchell starts with a mirror selfie showing off her comfy outfit (and mask!). She announces that this is her first melasma treatment and offers some background information about melasma and IPL treatments. Then, after a quick shot of her face with numbing cream, Mitchell takes a moment to show the camera her “little melasma spot” just below her eye and points to a patch of melasma on her upper lip. “Especially for new moms,” she says. “We go out in the sun and this is what happens.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Mitchell says she was too nervous to take video during the actual treatment, immediately after it she reports that her face is numb and that the IPL felt like “a million little elastic bands hitting all over.” She also points out a few red areas on her face that the treatment had targeted. Her facial treatment continues with a soothing collagen mask.\r\n\r\nThen, Mitchell cuts to an update from a week after her first treatment. She seems happy with the results so far. Although she says it’s recommended to get another one or two treatments, after the first one she feels that “we’re on track to lightening these little guys up.”\r\n\r\nMelasma is a form of hyperpigmentation that frequently shows up during or after pregnancy. The condition is so frequently associated with pregnancy that it’s sometimes even called the mask of pregnancy, SELF explained previously. It usually causes patches of brown or grayish-brown skin on the cheeks, forehead, nose, upper lip, and chin. Those patches aren’t harmful or painful, and sometimes, they’ll fade away on their own. But some people may want to have them lightened or removed.\r\n\r\nFirst off, as Mitchell points out, melasma is exacerbated by UV exposure, so wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 is usually a mainstay of melasma treatment and maintenance. Plus, recent research suggests that those with melasma may benefit from using a sunscreen containing iron oxides, which help block visible light from the sun and devices, like your phone or laptop.\r\n\r\nFrom there, treatment usually involves topical medications, such as prescription hydroquinone, which can lighten skin, the American Academy of Dermatology explains. Tretinoin, a powerful retinoid that speeds up the cell turnover process, is another common choice, as are corticosteroid medications and azelaic acid. \r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nBut topical medications aren’t always enough, which is where treatments like the one Mitchell received come in. For more stubborn melasma, a dermatologist might recommend in-office procedures like microdermabrasion, chemical peels, or laser treatments. The specific treatment Mitchell got—IPL—is similar to laser treatments but involves the use of multiple light wavelengths to treat certain issues. It’s especially useful in managing hyperpigmentation, broken blood vessels sometimes seen in rosacea, and age spots.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that nonablative treatments like this stimulate the growth of new collagen by heating up the skin, SELF explained previously. However, for most skin conditions, multiple treatments are required for you to see noticeable results. Mitchell specifically mentions in her video that she’s hoping her melasma spots will look lighter after three sessions.\r\n\r\nAfter treatment, it’s normal for the skin to be a little red, swollen, and sensitive for a few hours or a few days, Baylor College of Medicine explains.

INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (139, 14, 'Here’s Why You Get Sun Spots on Your Face—And How to Treat Them', 'They’re usually harmless.', '![img](/resources/images/wps8.png) \r\n\r\nIf you’ve spent any time in the sun throughout your life, you may have developed some sun spots on your face. These spots (also called age spots, liver spots, or solar lentigines) appear as flat, smooth brown spots on areas of your skin that tend to get a lot of sun exposure.\r\n\r\nSun spots are generally harmless areas of pigmented skin, but they can be easily confused with other types of sun-related spots on the skin, including some that may actually be a sign of skin cancer. If you think you have sun spots on your face, it’s important to monitor them and to get anything that looks iffy checked out by a board-certified dermatologist.\r\n\r\nHere’s what you need to know about sun spots, how to prevent them, how dermatologists can treat or remove them, and signs to look for that may signal an issue.\r\n\r\nWhat causes sun spots on your face?\r\n\r\nSun spots on your face are a type of hyperpigmentation caused by UV exposure. Essentially, after being exposed to the sun, your skin increases production of melanin, the pigment that gives skin color. Over time, some areas of your skin may develop clumps of melanin or may overproduce that pigment, resulting in a sun spot, the Mayo Clinic explains.\r\n\r\nThese types of spots tend to show up on areas of your body where you get the most sun, which might include your face, shoulders, hands, chest, and the back of your hands, Mary L. Stevenson, M.D., assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. Sun spots tend to be flat rather than raised, are usually brown, and may appear in clusters.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to prevent sun spots?\r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent sun spots on your face is to develop and maintain solid sun safety habits. “They can be prevented with diligent sun protection including use of sunscreen on regular basis, and other forms of sun protection like hats, sun glasses, and clothing,” Nada Elbuluk, M.D., clinical assistant professor of dermatology (clinician educator), Keck School of Medicine of USC, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nThat includes using broad spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) every day, particularly on areas of your body that are prone to sun exposure, like your face, your shoulders, and the back of your hands. Sun spots are more likely to show up on people with lighter skin, Elbuluk says, but people with darker skin tones can still develop sun-related skin damage, so it’s important for everyone to wear sunscreen regularly.\r\n\r\nBut we know that it’s a bit difficult to stick to diligent sunscreen wearing (and reapplication) habits—and even perfect sunscreen usage doesn’t protect you from 100% of the sun’s rays. That’s why it’s crucial to also use other sun protection strategies, like wearing sun-protective clothing, sticking to the shade whenever possible, and wearing hats and sunglasses that block the sun.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nEltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 ($38, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nNeutrogena Ultra-Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreen SPF 30 ($10, Amazon)\r\n\r\nLa Roche Posay Anthelios Mineral Sunscreen Gentle Lotion SPF 50 ($22, Amazon)\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to treat sun spots?\r\n\r\nTrue sun spots are not harmful and don\'t need to be treated. If you do decide you want to have your sun spots treated or removed for cosmetic reasons, this is something you’ll likely have to see a professional about. Although you can certainly try some products containing the classic brightening ingredients, like hydroquinone, retinoids, or vitamin C, “over-the-counter products are typically not strong enough to have a significant effect on sun spots,” Elbuluk explains.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nAlthough some of those products can be helpful in preventing sun spots and generally evening out your skin tone, they aren’t likely to be enough once you have the spots, Stevenson says. So if you want to have a sun spot removed, you’ll need to talk to a board-certified dermatologist. They may recommend using a prescription-strength lightening cream or procedures such as professional chemical peels or laser treatments, Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nAfter a laser treatment, the spot will usually “turn a little white, crust, and then peel off,” Stevenson explains, so that you’re left with a subtly pink area that eventually fades. After doing all that work to have the spot removed, it’s really important to keep it from getting any more sun, she says, especially while it’s still healing, because laser treatments can make your skin more sensitive to sun exposure. In fact, Stevenson says she generally doesn’t treat sun spots during the summer because of this risk for more pigmentation after treatment. \r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes other types of spots (called seborrheic keratoses) are confused with sun spots, Stevenson says. Seborrheic keratoses, like sun spots, are harmless brown, tan, or black growths on the skin, the Mayo Clinic explains. However, unlike true sun spots, these marks tend to be slightly raised, which means they may need to be shaved down or destroyed with electrocautery. These procedures may then be combined with laser treatments to further remove the pigment. Many people who are prone to sun spots are also prone to seborrheic keratoses, so it’s common to have both Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nHyperpigmentation on the face might also be melasma, a condition that tends to appear in patches on the cheeks, forehead, nose, or chin, SELF explained previously.\r\n\r\nWhen should you talk to a dermatologist?\r\n\r\nAlthough true sun spots aren’t harmful, they are a result of sun damage and therefore can be a sign that you need to get better at protecting yourself from sun exposure.\r\n\r\nSometimes, cancerous spots on your skin can look like sun spots or seborrheic keratoses, the Mayo Clinic says. So if you have a lot of sun spots or you notice one that looks suspicious or odd, it’s always a good idea to get checked out by a dermatologist. \r\n\r\nIn particular, it’s important to take note of any spots that seem to be growing or changing rapidly. “If [you have] a brown spot that seems to be changing in size, color, or appearance, then it may not be a sun spot and should be examined by a board-certified dermatologist to rule out skin cancer,” Elbuluk says.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:20:57', '2021-05-28 19:20:59', '/resources/images/wps8.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/sun-spots-on-face', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (140, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Spider Veins and Varicose Veins', 'This isn’t a DIY situation.', '![img](/resources/images/wps9.png)\r\n\r\nIf you’re wondering how to get rid of spider veins, you’ve probably already come across a bunch of the internet’s suggestions. When I noticed a series of faint blue lines twisting around my thigh, some of the recommended home remedies I saw included ginger tea, massage, and even exercise. But here’s the honest truth: That’s all B.S. Visible veins aren’t something you can fix at home.\r\n\r\nSo I talked to dermatologists and surgeons who specialize in treating spider veins and varicose veins (the larger, raised visible veins that often appear on the legs). What I learned is that the underlying causes of these visible veins aren’t always preventable—and they can be a sign of a much deeper vein problem that no home remedy is likely to fix. Here’s how to get rid of spider veins for real—and why it’s so important to see a specialist to do so.\r\n\r\nWhat actually are spider veins?\r\n\r\nThere are two common types of visible veins: spider veins and varicose veins. “Spider veins are really small superficial veins that are in the outer layer of skin between the dermis and epidermis, so you can see them,” Christopher Hollingsworth, M.D., a general surgeon at NYC Surgical Associates, tells SELF. “If you live long enough, most people are going to get them.” These veins get their name because they look like thin, weblike, blue-and-purple lines on the legs.\r\n\r\nVaricose veins, on the other hand, are larger veins that are deeper in the body. “You won’t see them as a discoloration, you’ll see them when they get so stretched out that they kind of bulge,” Dr. Hollingsworth says.\r\n\r\nBecause these two issues are caused by similar blood-flow situations, varicose and spider veins commonly occur together. That means that people who have varicose veins almost always have spider veins too. However, some people get spider veins and never have a problem with varicose veins.\r\n\r\nWhat causes spider veins and other visible veins?\r\n\r\nTo understand why these visible veins develop, you’ve got to understand how blood flows through the body. Your heart pumps blood to your entire body through your blood vessels. From there, blood circulates outward toward the extremities (legs, arms, head) through the arteries and back inward to the heart through your veins.\r\n\r\n“Think of veins as being a hose that flows from bottom-up toward your heart,” says dermatologist Alicia Barba, M.D., of Barba Dermatology. “And there’s a little valve. When they work well, the blood shoots up and the valve closes. When it doesn’t work, the blood falls back down instead of moving north.”\r\n\r\nWhen blood flows in the wrong direction because of a valve problem, it can get backed up in the veins of the legs, which damages the walls of the vein, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) explains. That extra pressure on the vein walls gradually causes them to weaken and then bulge, creating veins we can actually see. In fact, the majority of people who have spider veins and/or varicose veins will be dealing with this type of “venous insufficiency,” Dr. Hollingsworth says.\r\n\r\nHowever, other factors can contribute to the likelihood that you’ll develop visible veins, including genetics, age, and your level of physical activity, the AAD says.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if you have a job where you are standing still for long periods of time, gravity is at work pulling the blood back down toward the legs, causing the veins to get stretched out and the valves to weaken over time. If you sit all day at your job, you can also start to see visible veins because there is a lack of muscle movement. The muscles in the leg help the veins push the blood back up toward the heart, so moving around during the day can help prevent visible veins. (That rumor that crossing your legs can cause spider veins isn’t true, so go ahead and cross ’em if you like—just make sure that you get out of your chair and move around during the day to get the blood pumping.)\r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nThere is some research to suggest that carrying extra weight can impact the function of your veins and, therefore, also increase your risk for visible veins. Having more fat around your stomach (visceral fat) can increase the pressure in your abdomen, Dr. Hollingsworth says, which then creates an obstruction that blocks the flow of blood. “That increased pressure dilates the veins, which extends all the way through the lower vein bridge and all the way up to the veins in your skin,” he explains.\r\n\r\nA similar situation happens during pregnancy when the added pressure in the abdomen squeezes the veins. But the hormonal shifts that happen during pregnancy may also play a role. “When women are exposed to excess estrogen or progesterone, what it tends to do is make your soft tissue a little more flexible,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. “That same process, we think, is affecting the veins, making them predisposed to dilate and stretch out.” After pregnancy, the veins generally go away and everything returns to normal. This vein weakening can also happen if you’re taking hormonal birth control.\r\n\r\nAlthough visible veins may seem like a purely superficial issue, they can become painful when left untreated. “Spider and varicose veins make your legs sore because it’s an inflammatory process,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. “Those veins are getting dilated and stretched out. They’re trying to signal for help in the only way they know how, which is sending off a local inflammatory biochemical that causes your legs to swell and to be sore.” So preventing and treating spider veins can save you from a lot of discomfort.\r\n\r\nCan you do anything to prevent spider veins?\r\n\r\nThere are a few different underlying causes of vein issues that are preventable or reversible, while others aren\'t. For instance, if your visible veins are largely due to inherited factors, pregnancy, or how active you can be during the work day, that’s not likely something you have a ton of control over.\r\n\r\nBut there are some general things you can do to prevent them, such as maintaining physical activity during the day. If you sit at work all day, the AAD recommends getting up and walking around a bit every 30 minutes. Or, if you stand at work for long periods of time, the AAD recommends taking a break and sitting down every 30 minutes. And exercising in general, elevating your legs when possible, and avoiding soaking for long periods of time in hot baths can help prevent visible veins as well, the AAD says.\r\n\r\nHowever, these strategies can’t treat any visible veins you already have.\r\n\r\nYou’ll need to see a specialist to actually treat visible veins.\r\n\r\nIf you’re wondering how to get rid of spider veins for good, know that Dr. Hollingsworth says those wacky home remedies won’t work. Dry brushing? Nope. Fancy body lotions? Nah. Massage? It might feel good, but there won’t be a visible difference.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing really that you can do aside from the small minimally invasive treatments we have that is going to make spider veins look any better,” he says. “Creams, ointments, or rubbing aren’t going to make spider veins go away.”\r\n\r\nThe primary way that spider and varicose veins are treated is by using different surgical methods to close off the vein so that it collapses and the residual scar tissue stops the blood flow completely. These are all superficial veins, so other healthy veins just take over their circulation duties and the procedure won’t impact your overall health. Also, those with more serious, bulging varicose veins can have them removed completely once the vein is closed off.\r\n\r\nSclerotherapy: This is one of the more popular options for spider veins and varicose veins. A doctor injects a foamy detergent or concentrated saltwater solution into the problematic vein, which irritates the walls of the blood vessel, explains Neil Sadick, M.D., founder of Sadick Dermatology. This causes scar tissue to form, which leads the blood vessel to close. If someone is allergic to the sclerotherapy solution, there are other treatment options.\r\n\r\nLaser treatment: A vein surgeon or dermatologist might use a laser treatment to heat the vein, causing it to contract and scar over. Dr Hollingsworth uses a handheld Nd:YAG laser (the same machine that can be used in laser hair removal) on small spider veins. Or, if it’s a larger varicose vein, a laser may be inserted into the vein using a catheter to stop blood flow.\r\n\r\nMedical glue: For varicose veins, doctors might also use is the medical version of superglue. “Cyanoacrylate glue is a biologic glue that’s very similar to Krazy Glue,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. Surgeons close off a varicose vein by gluing it shut from the inside. “You inject it, wait for the glue to set, and move further down, and so on and so on.”\r\n\r\nRadio frequency ablation (RFA): This is another option for varicose veins that are so large that glue and sclero just float away. “RFA runs radio frequency through the inside of the vein and turns the inside of the vein into a lightbulb filament, heats it up, scars it, and kills it,” says Dr. Hollingsworth.\r\n\r\nTo prevent visible veins from getting worse, a surgeon might use RFA or internal laser techniques to close off a larger vein deeper in the leg that feeds the smaller varicose veins and spider veins. “There’s a central pipe in the leg called the saphenous vein; it’s the main superficial vein. Coming off those veins are truncal varicose veins,” Dr. Sadick says. Once the larger vein is taken care of, the smaller veins can be treated with sclerotherapy, glue, or a handheld laser.\r\n\r\nAll of these treatments are performed through tiny punctures in the skin, so you can likely schedule your procedure in the morning and go back to work in the afternoon. However, Dr. Barba warns about getting these treatments on darker skin tones, especially laser and RFA procedures, because those with darker skin tones have a higher risk for hyperpigmentation issues following the treatments. Plus, those pigmentation issues can be stubborn to treat. “Sometimes the pigmentation is a part of the healing process,” Dr. Barba says. “If you care about a little spider vein, you might care about the pigment that’s going to be there for a couple months.”\r\n\r\nWhatever treatment you go with, the key is to go to a doctor who specializes in vein treatments, whether that’s a dermatologist or a vein surgeon. “If you want have anything done, go to whoever does a lot of it,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. The good news is that insurance will cover many vein treatments. Without insurance, these treatments can cost $300 to $8,000. “Oftentimes, when it is a deeper vein problem, insurance covers it because it\'s not [just] a cosmetic issue,” Dr. Barba says.\r\n\r\nHow can you prevent spider veins from coming back?\r\n\r\nAlthough effective, all of these surgical treatments are really temporary fixes, Dr. Hollingsworth says. Spider and varicose veins can return in other nearby veins once the original veins are closed off or removed. So, if you decide not to treat them at all, they can multiply, Dr. Hollingsworth says. But if you stay on top of them—which will require repeated treatments every one to two years—you can keep them at bay.\r\n\r\nAfter treatment, one thing you can do to effectively prevent spider veins from returning is to wear compression stockings daily, which can be difficult to get on and uncomfortable to wear. \"Nobody likes wearing them,” Dr. Hollingsworth says. But, “if you wear stockings religiously during the day, they significantly reduce [the chance that] your spider veins [will come] back.” In some cases, your health insurance may actually cover the cost of medical-grade compression stockings, Medline Plus explains, so check with them before buying any.\r\n\r\nUltimately, if you’re dealing with spider veins or varicose veins, it’s important to check in with a doctor or dermatologist. They can help you understand how serious your particular issue is, talk about what may underlying issues may have caused it, and, if necessary, walk you through your treatment options.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:21:21', '2021-05-28 19:21:23', '/resources/images/wps9.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/spider-and-varicose-veins', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (141, 14, 'How to Prevent—and Treat—That Pesky Mask Acne', 'Don’t let “maskne” keep you from wearing a mask.', '![img](/resources/images/wps10.jpg)\r\n\r\nFeel like your face mask is causing acne? You’re probably not imagining it. Not only is it becoming offensively hot and humid this summer, but we’re also wearing masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19—both of which may contribute to acne and other skin issues.\r\n\r\nBreakouts, in particular, have become so common that mask acne has been dubbed “maskne” on the internet. While you can’t ditch the mask, there are steps you can take to prevent and treat mask-related acne to enjoy a safe summer with healthy skin.\r\n\r\nWhat causes mask acne?\r\n\r\nAcne usually develops when pores get clogged by oil, dead skin cells, makeup, dirt, or bacteria. This can lead to blackheads, whiteheads, or pimples that can vary in size and type, depending on how infected they get.\r\n\r\nAdopting a simple skin-care routine—including cleansing, exfoliating, moisturizing, and wearing sunscreen—helps manage acne because it helps with the skin’s natural shedding process. Regular cleansing and exfoliating ensures that all that gunk and dead skin cells are removed rather than clogging your pores. Moisturizing and wearing sunscreen helps ensure the skin’s protective outer layer functions properly.\r\n\r\nBut wearing a face mask can interfere with that process. Instead of those dead skin cells shedding “throughout the day, they now get clogged in your pores,” Carrie L. Kovarik, M.D., an associate professor of dermatology at University of Pennsylvania and a member of the American Association of Dermatology’s (AAD) COVID-19 task force, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nMasks also provide the perfect humid environment for bacteria to grow in our skin, which can lead to a breakout, Noelani Gonzalez, M.D., director of cosmetic dermatology at Mount Sinai, tells SELF.\r\n\r\nHow can you treat mask acne?\r\n\r\nIf you’re dealing with an active mask acne breakout there are ways to treat it—and the methods aren’t so different from the way you’d treat regular acne.\r\n\r\nFor milder cases, classic over-the-counter acne-fighting ingredients like benzoyl peroxide (which kills the bacteria associated with acne) and salicylic acid (a chemical exfoliant that helps unclog pores, should be your go-tos, Dr. Gonzalez says. You can try using a benzoyl peroxide-containing spot treatment, such as Neutrogena On-the-Spot Acne Treatment ($6, Amazon) or La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Acne Treatment ($30, Amazon). And for salicylic acid products, look for gentle acne cleansers, such as Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser ($11, Ulta) or First Aid Beauty Acne Clearing Charcoal Cleanser ($24, Dermstore).\r\n\r\nBut for more severe acne, meaning it’s inflamed or you’re dealing with deep, cystic pimples, a dermatologist might prescribe other treatments such as anti-inflammatory cortisone creams or retinoid medications, which speed up the skin’s natural cell turnover process.\r\n\r\nHowever, both prescription and over-the-counter acne remedies can be irritating, especially if you have sensitive skin or you’re also dealing with raw, red, inflamed areas of skin. In these cases, a dermatologist may recommend you use acne treatments less frequently or hold off on treating the acne altogether until the raw areas of your skin heals. So the right treatment for you may depend on the exact type of problem you develop and your skin type.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve tried over-the-counter options without success, then it’s best to check in with a board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Gonzalez says. Many dermatologists are now offering video consultations as well.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the best way to prevent mask acne?\r\n\r\nSince we’re going to be wearing masks for a while, managing mask acne isn’t going to be a one-time deal. It will require developing both treatment and ongoing prevention habits to keep your skin clear. And, because mask-related acne doesn’t just affect those who tend to be more acne-prone in general, dermatologists recommend that everyone practice good mask-wearing hygiene.\r\n\r\nWhat Every Parent Should Know About Meningitis B\r\n\r\nThe first step is to choose a mask that allows your skin (and you) to breathe while also protecting others and yourself from the spread of coronavirus. To accomplish that, the mask should sit snugly but comfortably on your face and should cover both your mouth and nose, SELF explained previously.\r\n\r\n“I recommend soft fabrics, something like cotton or silk,” Dr. Gonzalez says. “They are materials that tend to be more gentle and breathable on the skin, versus synthetic materials that tend to be harsher on the skin.” Here are a few cloth masks to check out as well as recommendations for those looking to work out in a mask.\r\n\r\nAfter choosing a well-fitting mask that doesn’t irritate your skin, it’s time to think about what you put under it. Choosing skin care and makeup products that are labeled non-comedogenic or oil-free underneath the mask can help reduce chances of breakouts. But Dr. Gonzalez suggests avoiding makeup under your mask entirely—especially heavy foundations and multiple layers of products, which can clog pores and lead to acne.\r\n\r\nInstead, wear a moisturizer with at least SPF 30, Dr. Gonzalez says. Not only will this protect your skin from UV rays, but wearing sunscreen can also help prevent other mask-related skin issues, such as tan lines. And the moisturizing helps reduce friction and chafing.\r\n\r\nAfter a long day of wearing your mask, use a gentle cleanser to wash your face to remove all the accumulated debris and oil, Dr. Kovarik says. But dry skin is another common face mask-related skin issue, so make sure to moisturize immediately after washing your face. Kovarik recommends using a moisturizer with ceramides, which help lock moisture into your skin, and/or hyaluronic acid, which has a hydrating effect.\r\n\r\nAnd if you’re thinking about adding anything new to your daily skin-care routine, Dr. Gonzalez recommends against starting any new harsh treatments for your skin. Adding products like harsh chemical peels can make the skin more sensitive “and should be avoided because that’ll make your skin more prone to breaking out,” she says.\r\n\r\nHow to wash your mask:\r\n\r\nYour face isn’t the only thing you need to wash! In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend washing cloth masks after each use, which helps remove oils and dead skin that collect inside the mask. To do so, use warm water and a gentle detergent that doesn’t irritate the skin.\r\n\r\nLook for detergents that are free of added colors and fragrances, which are common skin irritants, Dr. Kovarik says. This will ensure that you’re being gentle on sensitive or irritated skin and will reduce the chances of developing a reaction like contact dermatitis.\r\n\r\nAcne isn’t the only mask-related skin issue you might experience.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other skin issues that may arise during the summer of face masks. For instance, you may need to take extra care with your lips to prevent irritation. Unless you have a cone-shaped mask, “the lips are going to be the first thing your mask is going to touch,” Dr. Kovarik says. She recommends using a lip balm or Vaseline ($9 for a pack of 3, Amazon) to protect them.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you have a skin condition like rosacea or eczema, the irritation from face masks may trigger your symptoms. To manage that, definitely keep up the treatment plan that your dermatologist recommended for you, but get in touch with your derm if that plan is no longer enough to manage the flares.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:21:39', '2021-05-28 19:21:37', '/resources/images/wps10.jpg', 'https://www.self.com/story/mask-acne', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (142, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Back Acne for Good', 'And when to talk to a dermatologist.', '![img](/resources/images/wps11.png) \r\n\r\nFace acne is a common—and frustrating—skin condition to manage. And figuring out how to get rid of back acne is no different. For some people, back acne causes small pimples, while others deal with large cystic acne zits, which can be deep, painful, and pus-filled. And because back acne can be caused by external factors, particularly working out and wearing sweaty clothes, it can be stubborn to treat with the usual acne remedies—even if they work for the pimples on your face.\r\n\r\nSo what actually is back acne? And how can you treat it effectively? Here’s what you need to know about how to get rid of back acne for good.\r\n\r\nWhat causes back acne?\r\n\r\n“Acne is caused by increased oil production, bacteria, pore blockage, and irregular skin cell turnover,” board-certified dermatologist Eric Meinhardt, M.D., tells SELF, and that goes for your face and your back. Sebaceous glands in the skin produce oil, which can collect along with dead skin cells in the pores, plugging them up and giving bacteria a perfect breeding ground, all of which can lead to redness, whiteheads, blackheads, and sometimes infection.\r\n\r\nHormones can play a large role, which is why you might break out more around your period, for instance. And if you’ve noticed that your breakouts pop up in similar places as it does for other family members, that could signal that your acne has a hereditary component, Dr. Meinhardt says.\r\n\r\nWhile the root causes of zits are basically the same in both places, the skin on your face is very different from the skin on your back, which has its upsides and downsides. The skin on the face has more blood supply, Dr. Meinhardt says, which helps acne heal faster and reduces scarring. But the skin on the back is much thicker than the skin on the face (specifically the second layer, called the dermis). That means that the back is more resilient and can handle stronger treatments, scrubs, and exfoliants that would be considered too harsh for the face.\r\n\r\nHowever, not everything that looks like acne on your back is actually acne. For instance, so-called fungal acne tends to appear on the back and chest area and forms uniform red bumps. But traditional acne treatments won’t help manage it at all. So if you’re not sure what your issue really is, get checked out by a professional.\r\n\r\nHow can you treat—and prevent—back acne?\r\n\r\nTreating back acne can be a challenge, but there are some straightforward steps you can take at home that will help manage it, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). Here’s how to get rid of back acne for good:\r\n\r\nLook for benzoyl peroxide. Of all the over-the-counter acne medication options you have, the AAD suggests starting with benzoyl peroxide. This ingredient works by killing bacteria that fuel acne. The AAD recommends using a wash containing benzoyl peroxide by letting it sit on your skin for two to five minutes in the shower daily and then rinsing it off. They also suggest starting with a concentration of 5.3% and only going higher than that if a lower concentration isn’t enough. Although the skin on your back isn’t as sensitive as the skin on your face, high concentrations of benzoyl peroxide can cause side effects, so it’s still smart to start at a lower level and work your way up only if needed.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nPaula’s Choice Clear Extra Strength Daily Skin Clearing Treatment, $19, Amazon\r\n\r\nSLMD BP Body Wash, $35, Target\r\n\r\nPanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash 10%, $11, Target\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nTry a retinoid. Retinoids, particularly adapalene, are another great OTC option for treating acne. They work by speeding up the skin’s natural cell turnover process, which helps unclog pores and resolve acne more quickly. “Retinoids not only treat the acne you have today, they also change the way the cells turn over, reducing your development of acne tomorrow,” Heidi Waldorf, M.D., the director of laser and cosmetic dermatology at the Mount Sinai Hospital, tells SELF. These are especially effective when used alongside benzoyl peroxide, the AAD says. To make sure you don’t miss a spot when applying topical creams and gels, Waldorf recommends using an applicator like the L’applique to help you reach those hard-to-get-to areas.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nDifferin Gel, $15, Amazon\r\n\r\nLa Roche Posay Effaclar Adapalene Gel 0.1%, $30, Amazon\r\n\r\nAcne Free Adapalene Gel 0.1%, $12, Amazon\r\n\r\nSalicylic acid might work too. This classic acne-fighting ingredient works as a chemical exfoliant, breaking down dead skin cells and getting deep into pores to clear them out. It’s a common ingredient in spot treatments, but those might be hard to use on your back. “Salicylic acid is attracted to the oil in the sebaceous glands, and once there, it helps to loosen the sticky cells and oil to clear clogged hair follicles,” Dr. Waldorf says.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nNeutrogena Body Clear Body Wash, $7, Target\r\n\r\nMurad Acne Body Wash, $44, Murad\r\n\r\nDermaologica Clearing Skin Wash, $62, Ulta\r\n\r\nDevelop good workout habits. Working out and sweating can contribute to body acne, so it’s important to be mindful when you’re engaging in those activities. The AAD recommends opting for looser fitting clothes made of sweat-wicking fabric or cotton to avoid sweat accumulating next to your skin. It’s also important to change out of sweaty workout clothes as soon as possible and to wash them after every use.\r\n\r\nBe gentle with your skin. If your skin has acne, it will require a gentle touch. That means using a gentle body wash or cleanser—not a harsh scrub. It also means avoiding the very tempting urge to pick your acne as much as possible.\r\n\r\nWear sunscreen. Sun exposure can actually worsen acne and cause post-acne dark spots to become darker. Although wearing sunscreen is always important, it’s especially important if you’re trying to manage back acne. Look for products that are non-comedogenic and oil-free, which means they won’t contribute to clogged pores.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nEltaMD UV Lotion Broad-Spectrum SPF 30, $36, Dermstore\r\n\r\nHawaiian Tropic Sheer Touch Lotion Sunscreen SPF 50, $19, Amazon\r\n\r\nClinique Broad Spectrum SPF 30 Mineral Sunscreen For Body, $32, Sephora\r\n\r\nAvoid anything that rubs your skin. The friction caused by a backpack or or shoulder bag can worsen acne, especially if you’re also sweaty. If you can, hold your purse in your hand or rest the strap on your arm.\r\n\r\nTake care when washing your hair. The way you wash your hair can have an impact on bacne. While the oils in hair treatments might be good for nourishing your strands, they can be bad news for the skin on your back. That’s why Debbie Palmer, D.O., tells SELF that you should rinse conditioner off to the side instead of letting it run down your back. Also, try waiting until you’ve completed all of your hair treatments before washing your body. That way you can wash off any oily residue, clearing the way for your acne treatments to do their thing.\r\n\r\nWhen should you see a dermatologist for back acne?\r\n\r\nYou can probably treat mild to moderate back acne at home with over-the-counter options. But if your acne is more severe, meaning you have deep, painful cysts, you should see a dermatologist for help. They may prescribe stronger medications, like prescription retinoids, that can help clear your acne.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not sure if your acne is actually acne, you should also see your dermatologist. There are other skin conditions, including “fungal acne,” that can look a lot like regular acne but that require more specialized treatments.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:25:22', '2021-05-28 19:25:23', '/resources/images/wps11.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/how-to-get-rid-of-back-acne', 0, 0);
INSERT INTO `article-pl` VALUES (143, 14, 'How to Get Rid of Tan Lines—Without Any More Sun Exposure', 'You don\'t need to risk more sun!', '![img](/resources/images/wps12.png)\r\n\r\nWhen you get home from a long day in the sun, your first instinct might be to figure out how to get rid of those tan lines you accidentally picked up. Of course, you were wearing sunscreen and covering up as much as possible, but even those of us most dedicated to sun safety slip up every once in a while—and pay the price in sun damage and annoying tan lines.\r\n\r\nYou might assume that, to even out your skin tone, you need to get back in the sun or into a tanning bed. But that will only expose you to even more sun damage—and there are plenty of ways to get rid of tan lines without that. In fact, as SELF explained previously, tanning is the direct result of UV exposure to the skin. Over time, that kind of UV exposure can lead to more permanent damage to the skin as well as skin cancer, the CDC says.\r\n\r\nSo, while it’s understandable that you’d want to address the cosmetic concerns of tan lines, it’s important not to use intentional tanning—indoor or outdoor—to do that. Below, check out how to get rid of tan lines with a few safer tips. Not only will your skin tone even out, but your skin might also feel smoother, more moisturized, and more nourished after taking on some of these tips.\r\n\r\n1. Wear sunscreen.\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to lighten a tan or even out your skin tone, sunscreen is undoubtedly the most important part of your skin-care arsenal. Wearing sunscreen every day—yes, every single day—will help protect you from UV damage and therefore prevent the parts of your skin that are already tan from continuing to get tan.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nLa Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Milk Sunscreen SPF 100 ($25, Amazon)\r\n\r\nCOOLA Mineral Body Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 ($32, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nBanana Boat Simply Protect Sensitive Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50+ ($8, Target)\r\n\r\n2. Gently exfoliate.\r\n\r\nExfoliating your skin helps remove the outer layer of dead skin cells so that the newer, smoother skin cells underneath are revealed. You can do this with a physical exfoliant, like a scrub, or with a chemical exfoliant, a product containing something like glycolic acid or lactic acid. Over time, this will help your tan to fade, and it’s an important step before using a self-tanner, if that’s something you’re interested in. But be careful not to do this too often because exfoliating with products like these can irritate those with dry or sensitive skin.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nGlytone Exfoliating Body Wash ($32, Amazon)\r\n\r\nPaula’s Choice Weightless Body Treatment 2% BHA ($28, Paula’s Choice)\r\n\r\nShea Moisture Manuka Honey & Yogurt Skin Renewal Recipe Body Scrub ($11, Ulta)\r\n\r\n3. Moisturize and use self-tanner.\r\n\r\nAfter exfoliating in the shower, dry off well and load your fave moisturizer onto the already tanned areas to help create a barrier for when you apply the self-tanner. Then dip a makeup sponge into a quality self-tanning gel and blend color evenly into the paler skin; hang tight until it feels dry. You can use a self-tanning cream, but I like gel because it\'s easier to apply on smaller areas of skin. Repeat the exfoliate, lotion, tan routine daily until lines aren\'t noticeable.\r\n\r\nLung Cancer: Myth Vs.

Use body makeup.\r\n\r\nIf you’d prefer to cover your tan lines, try using body makeup. First, take off any clothes near tan lines to avoid staining your clothes and missing major areas. Then dip your index finger into a matte liquid bronzer or body foundation and tap a thin layer over the pale spots. Give it 15 seconds or so to dry, then reassess. If you need to go darker, add another layer. Once you nail your skin tone, gently sweep a bronzing powder over the entire area to help blend the faux with the glow, and finish with a spritz of makeup setting spray.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nDermablend Leg and Body Makeup ($34, Ulta)\r\n\r\nKKW Beauty Skin Perfecting Body Foundation ($45, Ulta)\r\n\r\nDior Backstage Face & Body Foundation ($40, Sephora)\r\n\r\n5. Try body products with vitamin C.\r\n\r\nIf those methods aren’t enough for you, you can also try using body products containing ingredients like vitamin C and niacinamide, which can help lighten hyperpigmentation. These are ingredients commonly used in skin-care products for the face aimed at reducing hyperpigmentation and just overall evening out skin tone. However, they generally take a few weeks to see a noticeable difference.\r\n\r\nProducts to try:\r\n\r\nM-61 Vitablast C Body Butter ($24, bluemercury)\r\n\r\nOne Love Organics Vitamin C Body Oil ($58, Dermstore)\r\n\r\nAveeno Positively Radiant Body Lotion ($28, Amazon)\r\n\r\n6. Wait it out.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get rid of tan lines is to just wait for them to naturally fade on their own while avoiding sun exposure as much as possible. In fact, your skin cells are constantly in a state of turning over, meaning the newer cells are pushed to the surface as the older skin cells die and flake off. So it’s estimated that, within about 7 to 10 days, your tan will fade significantly—as long as you’re not reexposing the skin to UV light.\r\n\r\nHow to prevent tan lines in the future:\r\n\r\nThe best way to prevent annoying tan lines in the future is to avoid getting a tan at all. That requires wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 anytime you’re exposed to the sun. But it also means trying to stay in the shade as much as possible, wearing clothing that covers your skin (and maybe even contains extra sun protection), and not spending extended time outdoors when the sun is at its strongest.\r\n\r\nTan lines certainly aren’t the most dangerous effect of sun exposure, but they can be annoying—and a sign that you may need to bump up your sun-safety habits.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:25:57', '2021-05-28 19:25:58', '/resources/images/wps12.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/beauty-how-to-fix-tan-lines', 0, 0);

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to keeping breakouts at a minimum, I have a handful of holy-grail skincare go-tos to help appease my finicky, combination skin. As a person who’s tried to do away with zits since the early days of middle school, I have a pretty clear understanding nowadays of the products that will work for me, from the moment they first touch my face. Since one of my long-term skin goals is to have the flexibility to just wear makeup for funsies instead of out of necessity, locking down an effective skincare routine as a foundation is key.\r\n\r\nAs the foundation of any good skincare routine, cleansing is a must, but finding a good cleanser has been the missing piece of my routine for a while. I typically rotate between a few that do the job, but don’t really check off all the boxes for my skin-care needs, which is why I was so surprised by how instantly I took to Space Wash, the new cleanser from buzzy skin-care brand, Starface.\r\n\r\nI’d become a fast fan of buzzy skin-care brand Starface (which was started by former ELLE beauty editor Julie Schott, who, it must be said, has amazing skin) after discovering how effective their cult-favorite Hydro-Stars were. The stars are the brand’s first- and best-sellers, hydrocolloid pimple patches in the shape of—you guessed it—stars, that make even the act of healing zits look cute, and their first-ever cleanser is similarly well-suited for my combination and acne-prone skin.\r\n\r\nSome cleansers have stung my eyes mid-wash, smelled overly perfumed, or left my skin feeling super tight and uncomfortable, but Space Wash is different—this cleanser truly gets me. Formulated with soothing ingredients like sage leaf and calendula flower extract, as well as white willow bark extract to help exfoliate skin, this cleanser has rewarded me with clarity and smoothness every time I use it. It has a barely-there scent with no added fragrance, feels very gentle on my skin, and doesn’t leave behind a sticky residue once it’s rinsed off. Not to mention, it’s comedogenic, dermatologist-tested, oil-free, and vegan.\r\n\r\nAfter rinsing my face, I squirt a nickel-size amount of the cleanser in one palm, add a hint of water, then rub my hands together to form a light, frothy lather. Space Wash is extra silky when I massage it on my face, and once it’s rinsed off, my skin feels clean but not stripped, a common characteristic of other acne-friendly cleansers I’ve used in the past. Not only is its formula absolutely everything for my skin, but the vibrant Space Wash tube (like all Starface products) is one of the best-looking beauty products on my shelf, and also completely recyclable once I’m done with it, which means it’s better for the environment, too.\r\n\r\nI’m so into this cleanser, that at this rate, I’m at a danger of overdoing it on my face washing routine. But if I do get a little heavy handed, I’m lucky that the product is also pretty affordable at $16 a tube and available for auto-refills, which I have to wager that you’ll want to do.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:26:20', '2021-05-28 19:26:21', '/resources/images/wps13.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/starface-space-wash-cleanser-review', 0, 0);

But others are finding themselves battling breakout after breakout, Carol Cheng, M.D., assistant clinical professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and director of the Acne Procedure Clinic at UCLA Medical Center, Santa Monica, tells SELF. “I’ve seen it go both ways,” she says, “and I can see a number of reasons why.”\r\n\r\nWhether your skin is getting better these days or…not, here’s what might be behind those changes.\r\n\r\nThere are tons of factors that could be affecting your skin right now—for better or worse.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to remember that some acne triggers aren’t going to change right now, Dr. Cheng says, such as the hormonal influence on skin and acne. But here are a few things that might be making a difference on your skin.\r\n\r\nStress, sleep, diet. People’s skin may respond to things like changes in stress, diet, and sleep in different ways, and we don’t totally understand why, Dr. Cheng says. But if you notice that your skin is behaving badly right now, it makes sense that it might have something to do with these other big changes in your environment and behavior right now.\r\n\r\nUsing fewer skin-care products. “Part of what’s helping people is they are cleaning up their routine,” Mary L. Stevenson, M.D., assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. Not having to go into an office every day is giving us the freedom to cut back on our skin-care regimens and really take the time to be thoughtful about what we’re putting on our face—perhaps we’re even doing it over the course of a morning rather than in 30 seconds before rushing out the door!\r\n\r\nFor some, that minimalism might make them realize they didn’t actually need all those products and that some of them might have even been making their skin break out or irritated. But some of us really do rely on those products to keep our skin calm and clear, Dr. Stevenson says, so taking a break could have a detrimental effect on our skin.\r\n\r\nWorking out at home. If you, like many of us, have gone from working out at your favorite gym or studio class to exclusively working out at home, that could also be having an effect on your skin, Dr. Stevenson says. At home you have time to take off your makeup, you’re not working out in the same room as 25 other sweaty people, and you can clean off all that sweat immediately after you’re done rather than waiting a full subway ride to shower at home. Having that much newfound control over your fitness environment could lead to overall less irritated and less acne-prone skin.\r\n\r\nWearing less makeup. As with skin care, a lot of us are finding that there’s less of a need to wear makeup daily because we’re leaving home so much less often. Personally, outside of the occasional Zoom call, I basically don’t wear any makeup these days, and my skin has been pretty into it. That could be because the products I was wearing are irritating, or it could just be the simple fact of not having an extra layer of stuff on top of my skin helps prevent acne. “The most irritating thing we do is too much,” Dr. Stevenson says.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Water Wellness Trends with Doctor Mike Varshavski\r\n\r\nSitting in front of screens constantly. Yes, if you are prone to hyperpigmentation, the blue light from your devices might exacerbate that, SELF explained previously. But the bigger risk of sitting idly in front of your laptop, phone, tablet, et cetera for hours on end is that you’re more likely to absent-mindedly pick at or touch your face, Dr. Cheng says, which can contribute to acne and interfere with the skin’s normal healing process.\r\n\r\nWearing face masks. If you’ve been wearing a face mask when in public (which, yes, you should be), you’ve probably noticed how quickly it can get hot and sweaty under there. You may have also noticed that you’re getting acne in the areas of your face that are under the mask. That could be thanks to acne mechanica, Dr. Cheng says, which is caused by something physically trapping that warmth and sweat on your skin.\r\n\r\nTake this opportunity to work on your relationship with your skin.\r\n\r\nOne of the few, tiny silver linings of having this time at home is being able to take the opportunity to more closely monitor your skin and how your products affect it, Dr. Stevenson says. But it’s also important to recognize when you’re paying too much attention to your skin, which can be especially difficult right now if you deal with OCD or a body-focused repetitive disorder that involves skin picking.\r\n\r\nIn general, Dr. Stevenson recommends checking in on your skin at three points during the day: when you wake up, when you get home from work, and before you go to bed. Right now, obviously, many of us don’t get home from work, we just are home and also working. So the blurring of that line can be a little difficult to navigate. It might require you to pick a time when your work day is usually over. Still, try to take those moments—and only those moments—throughout the day to tune in to your skin. And, as SELF explained previously, setting time limits like this is one crucial strategy to managing skin-fueled OCD symptoms.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it’s completely understandable that, with so many changes in our lives, our skin might be going through some changes too. And, for most of us, the changes will be relatively minor and easy to manage with our usual acne- and irritation-fighting strategies. But if your skin changes are causing extra stress or you don’t know what’s causing those changes, it’s worth checking in with a dermatologist about what you can do to deal with them.', 0, '2021-05-28 19:26:40', '2021-05-28 19:26:47', '/resources/images/wps14.png', 'https://www.self.com/story/skin-changes', 0, 0);
